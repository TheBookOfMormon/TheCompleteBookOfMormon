commanded of the Lord to make
these plates; wherefore, the record
of my father, and the genealogy of
his fathers, and the more part of all
our proceedings in the wilderness
are engraven upon those first plates
of which I have spoken; wherefore,
the things which transpired before
I made these plates are, of a truth,
more particularly made mention
upon the first plates.

3 And after I had made these plates
by way of commandment, I, Nephi,
received a commandment that the
ministry and the prophecies, the
more plain and precious parts of
them, should be written upon these
plates; and that the things which
were written should be kept for
the instruction of my people, who
should possess the land, and also
for other wise purposes, which
purposes are known unto the Lord.

4 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did make
a record upon the other plates,
which gives an account, or which
gives a greater account of the wars
and contentions and destructions
of my people. And this have I done,
and commanded my people what
they should do after I was gone;
and that these plates should be
handed down from one generation
to another, or from one prophet to
another, until further commandments
of the Lord.

5 And an account of my making
these plates shall be given hereafter;
and then, behold, I proceed according
to that which I have spoken;
and this I do that the more sacred
things may be kept for the knowledge
of my people.

6 Nevertheless, I do not write anything
upon plates save it be that I
think it be sacred. And now, if I
do err, even did they err of old; not
that I would excuse myself because
of other men, but because of the
weakness which is in me, according
to the flesh, I would excuse myself.

7 For the things which some men
esteem to be of great worth, both
to the body and soul, others set at
naught and trample under their
feet. Yea, even the very God of Israel
do men trample under their feet; I
say, trample under their feet but I
would speak in other wordsâ€”they
set him at naught, and hearken not
to the voice of his counsels.

8 And behold he cometh, according
to the words of the angel, in
six hundred years from the time
my father left Jerusalem.

9 And the world, because of their
iniquity, shall judge him to be a
thing of naught; wherefore they
scourge him, and he suffereth it; and
they smite him, and he suffereth
it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he
suffereth it, because of his loving
kindness and his long-suffering
towards the children of men.

10 And the God of our fathers,
who were led out of Egypt, out of
bondage, and also were preserved
in the wilderness by him, yea, the
