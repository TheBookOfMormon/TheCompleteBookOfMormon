one generation to another, even as
they had been handed down from
the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.

CHAPTER 29

Mosiah proposes that judges be chosen
in place of a king—Unrighteous kings
lead their people into sin—Alma the
younger is chosen chief judge by the
voice of the people—He is also the high
priest over the Church—Alma the elder
and Mosiah die. About 92-91 B.C.

Now when Mosiah had done this
he sent out throughout all the land,
among all the people, desiring to
know their will concerning who
should be their king.

2 And it came to pass that the voice
of the people came, saying: We are
desirous that Aaron thy son should
be our king and our ruler.

3 Now Aaron had gone up to the
land of Nephi, therefore the king
could not confer the kingdom upon
him; neither would Aaron take
upon him the kingdom; neither were
any of the sons of Mosiah willing
to take upon them the kingdom.

4 Therefore king Mosiah sent again
among the people; yea, even a written word sent he among the people.
And these were the words that were
written, saying:

5 Behold, O ye my people, or my
brethren, for I esteem you as such,
I desire that ye should consider the
cause which ye are called to consider—for ye are desirous to have
a king.

6 Now I declare unto you that he
to whom the kingdom doth rightly
belong has declined, and will not
take upon him the kingdom.

7 And now if there should be another appointed in his stead, behold
I fear there would rise contentions
among you. And who knoweth but
what my son, to whom the kingdom doth belong, should turn to
be angry and draw away a part
of this people after him, which
would cause wars and contentions
among you, which would be the
cause of shedding much blood and
perverting the way of the Lord,
yea, and destroy the souls of many
people.

8 Now I say unto you let us be wise
and consider these things, for we
have no right to destroy my son,
neither should we have any right
to destroy another if he should be
appointed in his stead.

9 And if my son should turn
again to his pride and vain things
he would recall the things which
he had said, and claim his right to
the kingdom, which would cause
him and also this people to commit much sin.

10 And now let us be wise and
look forward to these things, and
do that which will make for the
peace of this people.

11 Therefore I will be your king
the remainder of my days; nevertheless, let us appoint judges, to
judge this people according to our
law; and we will newly arrange the
affairs of this people, for we will
appoint wise men to be judges, that
will judge this people according to
the commandments of God.

12 Now it is better that a man
should be judged of God than of
man, for the judgments of God are
always just, but the judgments of
man are not always just.

13 Therefore, if it were possible
that you could have just men to be
your kings, who would establish the
laws of God, and judge this people
according to his commandments,
