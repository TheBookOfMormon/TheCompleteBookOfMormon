the land, by a secret way, into the
wilderness; and thus when Helaman
sent forth to take them they could
nowhere be found.

12 And more of this Gadianton
shall be spoken hereafter. And thus
ended the forty and second year
of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

13 And behold, in the end of this
book ye shall see that this Gadianton did prove the overthrow, yea,
almost the entire destruction of the
people of Nephi.

14 Behold I do not mean the end
of the book of Helaman, but I
mean the end of the book of Nephi,
from which I have taken all the
account which I have written.

CHAPTER 3

Many Nephites migrate to the land
northward—They build houses of cement
and keep many records—Tens
of thousands are converted and baptized—
The word of God leads men to
salvation—Nephi the son of Helaman
fills the judgment seat. About 49-39 B.C.

And now it came to pass in the forty
and third year of the reign of the
judges, there was no contention
among the people of Nephi save
it were a little pride which was in
the church, which did cause some
little dissensions among the people,
which affairs were settled in the
ending of the forty and third year.

2 And there was no contention
among the people in the forty
and fourth year; neither was there
much contention in the forty and
fifth year.

3 And it came to pass in the forty
and sixth, yea, there was much contention and many dissensions; in the
which there were an exceedingly
great many who departed out of
the land of Zarahemla, and went
forth unto the land northward to
inherit the land.

4 And they did travel to an exceedingly great distance, insomuch
that they came to large bodies of
water and many rivers.

5 Yea, and even they did spread
forth into all parts of the land,
into whatever parts it had not been
rendered desolate and without timber, because of the many inhabitants
who had before inherited the
land.

6 And now no part of the land was
desolate, save it were for timber;
but because of the greatness of the
destruction of the people who had
before inhabited the land it was
called desolate.

7 And there being but little timber
upon the face of the land, nevertheless the people who went forth
became exceedingly expert in the
working of cement; therefore they
did build houses of cement, in the
which they did dwell.

8 And it came to pass that they
did multiply and spread, and did
go forth from the land southward
to the land northward, and did
spread insomuch that they began
to cover the face of the whole earth,
from the sea south to the sea north,
from the sea west to the sea east.

9 And the people who were in the
land northward did dwell in tents,
and in houses of cement, and they
did suffer whatsoever tree should
spring up upon the face of the
land that it should grow up, that
in time they might have timber to
build their houses, yea, their cities,
and their temples, and their synagogues, and their sanctuaries, and
all manner of their buildings.

10 And it came to pass as timber
was exceedingly scarce in the land
northward, they did send forth
much by the way of shipping.
