upon their friends and their families
also, that they were not confounded.

38 And it came to pass that Jared
spake again unto his brother, saying: Go and inquire of the Lord
whether he will drive us out of the
land, and if he will drive us out of
the land, cry unto him whither we
shall go. And who knoweth but the
Lord will carry us forth into a land
which is choice above all the earth?
And if it so be, let us be faithful
unto the Lord, that we may receive
it for our inheritance.

39 And it came to pass that the
brother of Jared did cry unto the
Lord according to that which had
been spoken by the mouth of Jared.

40 And it came to pass that the
Lord did hear the brother of Jared,
and had compassion upon him,
and said unto him:

41 Go to and gather together thy
flocks, both male and female, of
every kind; and also of the seed of
the earth of every kind; and thy
families; and also Jared thy brother
and his family; and also thy friends
and their families, and the friends
of Jared and their families.

42 And when thou hast done this
thou shalt go at the head of them
down into the valley which is northward. And there will I meet thee,
and I will go before thee into a
land which is choice above all the
lands of the earth.

43 And there will I bless thee and
thy seed, and raise up unto me of thy
seed, and of the seed of thy brother,
and they who shall go with thee,
a great nation. And there shall be
none greater than the nation which
I will raise up unto me of thy seed,
upon all the face of the earth. And
thus I will do unto thee because this
long time ye have cried unto me.

CHAPTER 2

The Jaredites prepare for their journey
to a promised land—It is a choice
land whereon men must serve Christ
or be swept off—The Lord talks to the
brother of Jared for three hours—The
Jaredites build barges—The Lord asks
the brother of Jared to propose how the
barges will be lighted.

And it came to pass that Jared and
his brother, and their families,
and also the friends of Jared and
his brother and their families, went
down into the valley which was
northward, (and the name of the
valley was Nimrod, being called
after the mighty hunter) with their
flocks which they had gathered together, male and female, of every
kind.

2 And they did also lay snares and
catch fowls of the air; and they
did also prepare a vessel, in which
they did carry with them the fish
of the waters.

3 And they did also carry with
them deseret, which, by interpretation, is a honey bee; and thus they
did carry with them swarms of bees,
and all manner of that which was
upon the face of the land, seeds
of every kind.

4 And it came to pass that when
they had come down into the valley
of Nimrod the Lord came down and
talked with the brother of Jared; and
he was in a cloud, and the brother
of Jared saw him not.

5 And it came to pass that the Lord
commanded them that they should
go forth into the wilderness, yea,
