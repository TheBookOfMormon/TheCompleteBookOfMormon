all-searching eye; wherefore, ye
shall know at the last day, when
all men shall be judged of their
works, that the God of Israel did
witness that I shook your iniquities
from my soul, and that I stand with
brightness before him, and am rid
of your blood.

45 O, my beloved brethren, turn
away from your sins; shake off the
chains of him that would bind you
fast; come unto that God who is the
rock of your salvation.

46 Prepare your souls for that glorious
day when justice shall be administered
unto the righteous, even
the day of judgment, that ye may
not shrink with awful fear; that ye
may not remember your awful guilt
in perfectness, and be constrained
to exclaim: Holy, holy are thy judgments,
O Lord God Almightyâ€”but
I know my guilt; I transgressed thy
law, and my transgressions are mine;
and the devil hath obtained me,
that I am a prey to his awful misery.

47 But behold, my brethren, is it
expedient that I should awake you
to an awful reality of these things?
Would I harrow up your souls if
your minds were pure? Would I
be plain unto you according to the
plainness of the truth if ye were
freed from sin?

48 Behold, if ye were holy I would
speak unto you of holiness; but as
ye are not holy, and ye look upon
me as a teacher, it must needs be
expedient that I teach you the consequences
of sin.

49 Behold, my soul abhorreth sin,
and my heart delighteth in righteousness;
and I will praise the holy
name of my God.

50 Come, my brethren, every one
that thirsteth, come ye to the waters;
and he that hath no money,
come buy and eat; yea, come buy
wine and milk without money and
without price.

51 Wherefore, do not spend money
for that which is of no worth, nor
your labor for that which cannot
satisfy. Hearken diligently unto
me, and remember the words which
I have spoken; and come unto the
Holy One of Israel, and feast upon
that which perisheth not, neither
can be corrupted, and let your soul
delight in fatness.

52 Behold, my beloved brethren,
remember the words of your God;
pray unto him continually by day,
and give thanks unto his holy name
by night. Let your hearts rejoice.

53 And behold how great the covenants
of the Lord, and how great his
condescensions unto the children of
men; and because of his greatness,
and his grace and mercy, he has
promised unto us that our seed shall
not utterly be destroyed, according
to the flesh, but that he would preserve
them; and in future generations
they shall become a righteous
branch unto the house of Israel.

54 And now, my brethren, I would
speak unto you more; but on the
morrow I will declare unto you
the remainder of my words. Amen.
