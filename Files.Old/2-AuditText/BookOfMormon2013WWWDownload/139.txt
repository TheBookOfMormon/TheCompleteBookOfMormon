And if ye shall believe in Christ ye
will believe in these words, for they
are the words of Christ, and he hath
given them unto me; and they teach
all men that they should do good.

11 And if they are not the words
of Christ, judge ye—for Christ will
show unto you, with power and
great glory, that they are his words,
at the last day; and you and I shall
stand face to face before his bar; and
ye shall know that I have been commanded
of him to write these things,
notwithstanding my weakness.

12 And I pray the Father in the
name of Christ that many of us, if
not all, may be saved in his kingdom
at that great and last day.

13 And now, my beloved brethren,

all those who are of the house of
Israel, and all ye ends of the earth,
I speak unto you as the voice of one
crying from the dust: Farewell until
that great day shall come.

14 And you that will not partake
of the goodness of God, and respect
the words of the Jews, and also my
words, and the words which shall
proceed forth out of the mouth of
the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you
an everlasting farewell, for these
words shall condemn you at the
last day.

15 For what I seal on earth, shall
be brought against you at the judgment
bar; for thus hath the Lord
commanded me, and I must obey.
Amen.

CHAPTER 1

Jacob and Joseph seek to persuade men
to believe in Christ and keep His commandments—
Nephi dies—Wickedness prevails among
the Nephites. About 544-421 B.C.

For behold, it came to pass
that fifty and five years had
passed away from the time
that Lehi left Jerusalem; wherefore,
Nephi gave me, Jacob, a commandment
concerning the small
plates, upon which these things are
engraven.

2 And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment
that I should write upon
these plates a few of the things
which I considered to be most
precious; that I should not touch,
save it were lightly, concerning the
history of this people which are
called the people of Nephi.

3 For he said that the history of his
