3 And it came to pass that while
they were thus conversing one with
another, they heard a voice as if it
came out of heaven; and they cast
their eyes round about, for they
understood not the voice which
they heard; and it was not a harsh
voice, neither was it a loud voice;
nevertheless, and notwithstanding
it being a small voice it did pierce
them that did hear to the center,
insomuch that there was no part
of their frame that it did not cause
to quake; yea, it did pierce them to
the very soul, and did cause their
hearts to burn.

4 And it came to pass that again
they heard the voice, and they understood it not.

5 And again the third time they did
hear the voice, and did open their
ears to hear it; and their eyes were
towards the sound thereof; and they
did look steadfastly towards heaven,
from whence the sound came.

6 And behold, the third time they
did understand the voice which
they heard; and it said unto them:

7 Behold my Beloved Son, in

into the world.

11 And behold, I am the light
and the life of the world; and I
have drunk out of that bitter cup
which the Father hath given me, and
have glorified the Father in taking
upon me the sins of the world, in
the which I have suffered the will
of the Father in all things from the
beginning.

12 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had spoken these words the
whole multitude fell to the earth;
for they remembered that it had
been prophesied among them
that Christ should show himself
unto them after his ascension into
heaven.

13 And it came to pass that the
Lord spake unto them saying:

14 Arise and come forth unto me,
that ye may thrust your hands
into my side, and also that ye may

hands and in my feet, that ye may
know that I am the God of Israel,
and the God of the whole earth,
