27 And it shall come to pass in
that day that his burden shall be
taken away from off thy shoulder,
and his yoke from off thy neck, and
the yoke shall be destroyed because
of the anointing.

28 He is come to Aiath, he is
passed to Migron; at Michmash he
hath laid up his carriages.

29 They are gone over the passage;
they have taken up their lodging at
Geba; Ramath is afraid; Gibeah of
Saul is fled.

30 Lift up the voice, O daughter of
Gallim; cause it to be heard unto
Laish, O poor Anathoth.

31 Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants
of Gebim gather themselves
to flee.

32 As yet shall he remain at Nob
that day; he shall shake his hand
against the mount of the daughter
of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.

33 Behold, the Lord, the Lord of
Hosts shall lop the bough with
terror; and the high ones of stature
shall be hewn down; and the
haughty shall be humbled.

34 And he shall cut down the
thickets of the forests with iron, and
Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

CHAPTER 21

The stem of Jesse (Christ) will judge
in righteousness—The knowledge of
God will cover the earth in the Millennium—
The Lord will raise an ensign
and gather Israel—Compare Isaiah 11.
About 559-545 B.C.

And there shall come forth a rod
out of the stem of Jesse, and a
branch shall grow out of his roots.

2 And the Spirit of the Lord shall
rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom
and understanding, the spirit
of counsel and might, the spirit of
knowledge and of the fear of the
Lord;

3 And shall make him of quick
understanding in the fear of the
Lord; and he shall not judge after
the sight of his eyes, neither reprove
after the hearing of his ears.

4 But with righteousness shall he
judge the poor, and reprove with
equity for the meek of the earth;
and he shall smite the earth with
the rod of his mouth, and with the
breath of his lips shall he slay the
wicked.

5 And righteousness shall be the
girdle of his loins, and faithfulness
the girdle of his reins.

6 The wolf also shall dwell with
the lamb, and the leopard shall lie
down with the kid, and the calf and
the young lion and fatling together;
and a little child shall lead them.

7 And the cow and the bear shall
feed; their young ones shall lie
down together; and the lion shall
eat straw like the ox.

8 And the sucking child shall play
on the hole of the asp, and the
weaned child shall put his hand
on the cockatrice's den.

9 They shall not hurt nor destroy
in all my holy mountain, for the
earth shall be full of the knowledge
