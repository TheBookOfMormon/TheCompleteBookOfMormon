forth water, that the children of
Israel might quench their thirst.

30 And notwithstanding they
being led, the Lord their God, their
Redeemer, going before them, leading
them by day and giving light
unto them by night, and doing all
things for them which were expedient
for man to receive, they hardened
their hearts and blinded their
minds, and reviled against Moses
and against the true and living God.

31 And it came to pass that according
to his word he did destroy
them; and according to his word he
did lead them; and according to his
word he did do all things for them;
and there was not any thing done
save it were by his word.

32 And after they had crossed
the river Jordan he did make them
