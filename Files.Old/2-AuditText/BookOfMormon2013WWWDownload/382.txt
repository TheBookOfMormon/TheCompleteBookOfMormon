19 Or is it that ye have neglected
us because ye are in the heart of our
country and ye are surrounded by
security, that ye do not cause food
to be sent unto us, and also men to
strengthen our armies?

20 Have ye forgotten the commandments of the Lord your God?
Yea, have ye forgotten the captivity
of our fathers? Have ye forgotten the
many times we have been delivered
out of the hands of our enemies?

21 Or do ye suppose that the Lord
will still deliver us, while we sit
upon our thrones and do not make
use of the means which the Lord
has provided for us?

22 Yea, will ye sit in idleness while
ye are surrounded with thousands
of those, yea, and tens of thousands,
who do also sit in idleness, while
there are thousands round about
in the borders of the land who are
falling by the sword, yea, wounded
and bleeding?

23 Do ye suppose that God will
look upon you as guiltless while ye
sit still and behold these things?
Behold I say unto you, Nay. Now
I would that ye should remember
that God has said that the inward
vessel shall be cleansed first,
and then shall the outer vessel be
cleansed also.

24 And now, except ye do repent
of that which ye have done, and
begin to be up and doing, and send
forth food and men unto us, and also
unto Helaman, that he may support
those parts of our country which
he has regained, and that we may
also recover the remainder of our
possessions in these parts, behold it
will be expedient that we contend
no more with the Lamanites until
we have first cleansed our inward
vessel, yea, even the great head of
our government.

25 And except ye grant mine epistle, and come out and show unto
me a true spirit of freedom, and
strive to strengthen and fortify our
armies, and grant unto them food
for their support, behold I will leave
a part of my freemen to maintain
this part of our land, and I will
leave the strength and the blessings
of God upon them, that none other
power can operate against them—

26 And this because of their exceeding faith, and their patience
in their tribulations—

27 And I will come unto you, and
if there be any among you that
has a desire for freedom, yea, if
there be even a spark of freedom
remaining, behold I will stir up insurrections among you, even until
those who have desires to usurp
power and authority shall become
extinct.

28 Yea, behold I do not fear your
power nor your authority, but it
is my God whom I fear; and it is
according to his commandments
that I do take my sword to defend
the cause of my country, and it is
because of your iniquity that we
have suffered so much loss.

29 Behold it is time, yea, the time
is now at hand, that except ye do
bestir yourselves in the defence of
your country and your little ones,
the sword of justice doth hang over
you; yea, and it shall fall upon you
and visit you even to your utter
destruction.

30 Behold, I wait for assistance
from you; and, except ye do administer unto our relief, behold, I
come unto you, even in the land of
Zarahemla, and smite you with the
sword, insomuch that ye can have no
more power to impede the progress
of this people in the cause of our
freedom.

31 For behold, the Lord will not
suffer that ye shall live and wax
strong in your iniquities to destroy
his righteous people.

32 Behold, can you suppose that
the Lord will spare you and come
