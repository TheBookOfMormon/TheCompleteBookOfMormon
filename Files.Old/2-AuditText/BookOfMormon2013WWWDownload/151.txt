went down into the nethermost
parts of the vineyard. And it came
to pass that they beheld that the
fruit of the natural branches had
become corrupt also; yea, the first
and the second and also the last;
and they had all become corrupt.

40 And the wild fruit of the last
had overcome that part of the tree
which brought forth good fruit,
even that the branch had withered
away and died.

41 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard wept, and
said unto the servant: What could
I have done more for my vineyard?

42 Behold, I knew that all the fruit of
the vineyard, save it were these, had
become corrupted. And now these
which have once brought forth good
fruit have also become corrupted;
and now all the trees of my vineyard
are good for nothing save it be to be
hewn down and cast into the fire.

43 And behold this last, whose
branch hath withered away, I did
plant in a good spot of ground; yea,
even that which was choice unto me
above all other parts of the land of
my vineyard.

44 And thou beheldest that I also
cut down that which cumbered
this spot of ground, that I might
plant this tree in the stead thereof.

45 And thou beheldest that a part
thereof brought forth good fruit,
and a part thereof brought forth
wild fruit; and because I plucked
not the branches thereof and cast
them into the fire, behold, they have
overcome the good branch that it
hath withered away.

46 And now, behold, notwithstanding
all the care which we have taken
of my vineyard, the trees thereof
have become corrupted, that they
bring forth no good fruit; and these
I had hoped to preserve, to have laid
up fruit thereof against the season,
unto mine own self. But, behold,
they have become like unto the
wild olive tree, and they are of no
worth but to be hewn down and
cast into the fire; and it grieveth
me that I should lose them.

47 But what could I have done
more in my vineyard? Have I slackened
mine hand, that I have not
nourished it? Nay, I have nourished
it, and I have digged about it, and I
have pruned it, and I have dunged
it; and I have stretched forth mine
hand almost all the day long, and
the end draweth nigh. And it grieveth
me that I should hew down all
the trees of my vineyard, and cast
them into the fire that they should
be burned. Who is it that has corrupted
my vineyard?

48 And it came to pass that the servant
said unto his master: Is it not
the loftiness of thy vineyardâ€”have
not the branches thereof overcome
the roots which are good? And because
the branches have overcome
the roots thereof, behold they grew
faster than the strength of the roots,
taking strength unto themselves.
Behold, I say, is not this the cause
that the trees of thy vineyard have
become corrupted?

49 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard said unto the
servant: Let us go to and hew down
the trees of the vineyard and cast
them into the fire, that they shall
not cumber the ground of my vineyard,
for I have done all. What could
I have done more for my vineyard?

50 But, behold, the servant said
unto the Lord of the vineyard: Spare
it a little longer.
