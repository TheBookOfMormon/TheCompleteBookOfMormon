unto his children, of which I shall
not make a full account.

17 But I shall make an account of
my proceedings in my days. Behold,
I make an abridgment of the record
of my father, upon plates which I
have made with mine own hands;
wherefore, after I have abridged
the record of my father then will I
make an account of mine own life.

18 Therefore, I would that ye
should know, that after the Lord had
shown so many marvelous things
unto my father, Lehi, yea, concerning
the destruction of Jerusalem,
behold he went forth among the
people, and began to prophesy
and to declare unto them concerning
the things which he had both
seen and heard.

19 And it came to pass that the
Jews did mock him because of the
things which he testified of them;
for he truly testified of their wickedness
and their abominations; and
he testified that the things which he
saw and heard, and also the things
which he read in the book, manifested
plainly of the coming of a
Messiah, and also the redemption
of the world.

20 And when the Jews heard these
things they were angry with him;
yea, even as with the prophets of
old, whom they had cast out, and
stoned, and slain; and they also
sought his life, that they might
take it away. But behold, I, Nephi,
will show unto you that the tender
mercies of the Lord are over all
those whom he hath chosen, because
of their faith, to make them
mighty even unto the power of
deliverance.

CHAPTER 2

Lehi takes his family into the wilderness
by the Red Sea—They leave their
property—Lehi offers a sacrifice to the
Lord and teaches his sons to keep the
commandments—Laman and Lemuel
murmur against their father—Nephi is
obedient and prays in faith; the Lord
speaks to him, and he is chosen to rule
over his brethren. About 600 B.C.

For behold, it came to pass that
the Lord spake unto my father, yea,
even in a dream, and said unto him:
Blessed art thou Lehi, because of
the things which thou hast done;
and because thou hast been faithful
and declared unto this people the
things which I commanded thee,
behold, they seek to take away
thy life.

2 And it came to pass that the Lord
commanded my father, even in a
dream, that he should take his family
and depart into the wilderness.

3 And it came to pass that he was
obedient unto the word of the Lord,
wherefore he did as the Lord commanded
him.

4 And it came to pass that he departed
into the wilderness. And
he left his house, and the land of
his inheritance, and his gold, and
his silver, and his precious things,
and took nothing with him, save it
