you concerning those twenty-four
plates, that ye keep them, that the
mysteries and the works of darkness, and their secret works, or the
secret works of those people who
have been destroyed, may be made
manifest unto this people; yea, all
their murders, and robbings, and
their plunderings, and all their
wickedness and abominations, may
be made manifest unto this people;
yea, and that ye preserve these interpreters.

22 For behold, the Lord saw that
his people began to work in darkness, yea, work secret murders and
abominations; therefore the Lord
said, if they did not repent they
should be destroyed from off the
face of the earth.

23 And the Lord said: I will prepare
unto my servant Gazelem, a stone,
which shall shine forth in darkness
unto light, that I may discover unto
my people who serve me, that I
may discover unto them the works
of their brethren, yea, their secret
works, their works of darkness, and
their wickedness and abominations.

24 And now, my son, these interpreters were prepared that the word
of God might be fulfilled, which he
spake, saying:

25 I will bring forth out of darkness unto light all their secret works
and their abominations; and except
they repent I will destroy them from
off the face of the earth; and I will
bring to light all their secrets and
abominations, unto every nation
that shall hereafter possess the land.

26 And now, my son, we see that
they did not repent; therefore they
have been destroyed, and thus far
the word of God has been fulfilled;
yea, their secret abominations have
been brought out of darkness and
made known unto us.

27 And now, my son, I command
you that ye retain all their oaths,
and their covenants, and their agreements in their secret abominations;
yea, and all their signs and their
wonders ye shall keep from this
people, that they know them not,
lest peradventure they should fall
into darkness also and be destroyed.

28 For behold, there is a curse
upon all this land, that destruction
shall come upon all those workers
of darkness, according to the power
of God, when they are fully ripe;
therefore I desire that this people
might not be destroyed.

29 Therefore ye shall keep these
secret plans of their oaths and
their covenants from this people,
and only their wickedness and
their murders and their abominations shall ye make known unto
them; and ye shall teach them to
abhor such wickedness and abominations
and murders; and ye shall
also teach them that these people
were destroyed on account of their
wickedness and abominations and
their murders.

30 For behold, they murdered all
the prophets of the Lord who came
among them to declare unto them
concerning their iniquities; and
the blood of those whom they murdered did cry unto the Lord their
God for vengeance upon those who
were their murderers; and thus the
judgments of God did come upon
these workers of darkness and secret combinations.

31 Yea, and cursed be the land forever and ever unto those workers of
