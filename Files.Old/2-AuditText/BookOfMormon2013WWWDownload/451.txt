did do, going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did
see with their eyes and did feel
with their hands, and did know of
a surety and did bear record, that
it was he, of whom it was written
by the prophets, that should come.

16 And when they had all gone
forth and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one
accord, saying:

17 Hosanna! Blessed be the name
of the Most High God! And they did
fall down at the feet of Jesus, and
did worship him.

18 And it came to pass that he
spake unto Nephi (for Nephi was
among the multitude) and he commanded him that he should come
forth.

19 And Nephi arose and went forth,
and bowed himself before the Lord
and did kiss his feet.

20 And the Lord commanded him
that he should arise. And he arose
and stood before him.

21 And the Lord said unto him: I

again out of the water.

27 And after this manner shall ye

and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are
one; and I am in the Father, and
the Father in me, and the Father
and I are one.

28 And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize.
And there shall be no disputations
among you, as there have hitherto
been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the
points of my doctrine, as there have
hitherto been.

29 For verily, verily I say unto you,
