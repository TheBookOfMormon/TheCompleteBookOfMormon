Now it came to pass that in
the first year of the reign
of the judges over the people
of Nephi, from this time forward,
king Mosiah having gone the way
of all the earth, having warred a
good warfare, walking uprightly
before God, leaving none to reign
in his stead; nevertheless he had
established laws, and they were
acknowledged by the people; therefore they were obliged to abide by
the laws which he had made.

2 And it came to pass that in the
first year of the reign of Alma in
the judgment-seat, there was a man
brought before him to be judged, a
man who was large, and was noted
for his much strength.

3 And he had gone about among
the people, preaching to them that
which he termed to be the word
of God, bearing down against the
church; declaring unto the people
that every priest and teacher ought
to become popular; and they ought
not to labor with their hands, but
that they ought to be supported by
the people.

4 And he also testified unto the
people that all mankind should be
saved at the last day, and that they
need not fear nor tremble, but that
they might lift up their heads and
rejoice; for the Lord had created
all men, and had also redeemed all
men; and, in the end, all men should
have eternal life.

7 And it came to pass as he was
going, to preach to those who believed on his word, he met a man
who belonged to the church of God,
yea, even one of their teachers;
and he began to contend with him
sharply, that he might lead away
the people of the church; but the
man withstood him, admonishing
him with the words of God.

8 Now the name of the man was
Gideon; and it was he who was an
instrument in the hands of God in
delivering the people of Limhi out
of bondage.

9 Now, because Gideon withstood
him with the words of God he was
wroth with Gideon, and drew his
sword and began to smite him. Now
Gideon being stricken with many
years, therefore he was not able to
withstand his blows, therefore he
was slain by the sword.

10 And the man who slew him was
taken by the people of the church,
and was brought before Alma, to
be judged according to the crimes
which he had committed.

11 And it came to pass that he stood
before Alma and pled for himself
with much boldness.

12 But Alma said unto him: Behold, this is the first time that
priestcraft has been introduced
among this people. And behold,
thou art not only guilty of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to enforce it by the sword; and were
