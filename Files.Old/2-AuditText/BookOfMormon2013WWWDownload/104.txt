Hosts soon cometh upon all nations,
yea, upon every one; yea, upon the
proud and lofty, and upon every
one who is lifted up, and he shall
be brought low.

13 Yea, and the day of the Lord
shall come upon all the cedars
of Lebanon, for they are high and
lifted up; and upon all the oaks of
Bashan;

14 And upon all the high mountains,
and upon all the hills, and
upon all the nations which are lifted
up, and upon every people;

15 And upon every high tower,
and upon every fenced wall;

16 And upon all the ships of the sea,
and upon all the ships of Tarshish,
and upon all pleasant pictures.

17 And the loftiness of man shall
be bowed down, and the haughtiness
of men shall be made low; and
the Lord alone shall be exalted in
that day.

18 And the idols he shall utterly
abolish.

19 And they shall go into the holes
of the rocks, and into the caves of the
earth, for the fear of the Lord shall
come upon them and the glory of his
majesty shall smite them, when he
ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

20 In that day a man shall cast
his idols of silver, and his idols of
gold, which he hath made for himself
to worship, to the moles and to
the bats;

21 To go into the clefts of the rocks,
and into the tops of the ragged rocks,
for the fear of the Lord shall come
upon them and the majesty of his
glory shall smite them, when he
ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

22 Cease ye from man, whose
breath is in his nostrils; for wherein
is he to be accounted of?

CHAPTER 13

Judah and Jerusalem will be punished
for their disobedience—The Lord pleads
for and judges His people—The daughters
of Zion are cursed and tormented
for their worldliness—Compare Isaiah 3.
About 559-545 B.C.

For behold, the Lord, the Lord of
Hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem,
and from Judah, the stay and
the staff, the whole staff of bread,
and the whole stay of water—

2 The mighty man, and the man
of war, the judge, and the prophet,
and the prudent, and the ancient;

3 The captain of fifty, and the
honorable man, and the counselor,
and the cunning artificer, and the
eloquent orator.

4 And I will give children unto
them to be their princes, and babes
shall rule over them.

5 And the people shall be oppressed,
every one by another,
and every one by his neighbor; the
child shall behave himself proudly
against the ancient, and the base
against the honorable.

6 When a man shall take hold of his
brother of the house of his father,
and shall say: Thou hast clothing,
be thou our ruler, and let not this
ruin come under thy hand—

7 In that day shall he swear, saying:
I will not be a healer; for in my
house there is neither bread nor
clothing; make me not a ruler of the

8 For Jerusalem is ruined, and
Judah is fallen, because their
