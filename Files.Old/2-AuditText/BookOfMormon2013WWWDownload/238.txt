of Nephi; and there was continual
peace in all that time.

6 And it came to pass in the eighth
year of the reign of the judges,
that the people of the church began to wax proud, because of their
exceeding riches, and their fine
silks, and their fine-twined linen,
and because of their many flocks
and herds, and their gold and their
silver, and all manner of precious
things, which they had obtained
by their industry; and in all these
things were they lifted up in the
pride of their eyes, for they began
to wear very costly apparel.

7 Now this was the cause of much
affliction to Alma, yea, and to many
of the people whom Alma had consecrated to be teachers, and priests,
and elders over the church; yea,
many of them were sorely grieved
for the wickedness which they saw
had begun to be among their people.

8 For they saw and beheld with
great sorrow that the people of the
church began to be lifted up in the
pride of their eyes, and to set their
hearts upon riches and upon the
vain things of the world, that they
began to be scornful, one towards
another, and they began to persecute
those that did not believe according to their own will and pleasure.

9 And thus, in this eighth year of
the reign of the judges, there began
to be great contentions among the
people of the church; yea, there were
envyings, and strife, and malice,
and persecutions, and pride, even
to exceed the pride of those who
did not belong to the church of God.

10 And thus ended the eighth
year of the reign of the judges; and
the wickedness of the church was
a great stumbling-block to those
who did not belong to the church;
and thus the church began to fail
in its progress.

11 And it came to pass in the commencement of the ninth year, Alma
saw the wickedness of the church,
and he saw also that the example
of the church began to lead those
who were unbelievers on from one
piece of iniquity to another, thus
bringing on the destruction of the
people.

12 Yea, he saw great inequality
among the people, some lifting
themselves up with their pride, despising others, turning their backs
upon the needy and the naked and
those who were hungry, and those
who were athirst, and those who
were sick and afflicted.

13 Now this was a great cause for
lamentations among the people,
while others were abasing themselves, succoring those who stood in
need of their succor, such as imparting their substance to the poor and
the needy, feeding the hungry, and
suffering all manner of afflictions,
for Christ's sake, who should come
according to the spirit of prophecy;

14 Looking forward to that day,
thus retaining a remission of
their sins; being filled with great
joy because of the resurrection of
the dead, according to the will and
power and deliverance of Jesus
Christ from the bands of death.

15 And now it came to pass that
Alma, having seen the afflictions of
the humble followers of God, and
