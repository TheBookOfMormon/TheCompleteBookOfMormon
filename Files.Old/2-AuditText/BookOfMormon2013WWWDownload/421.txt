unto me; and cursed be they who
hide not up their treasures unto me;
for none hideth up their treasures
unto me save it be the righteous; and
he that hideth not up his treasures
unto me, cursed is he, and also the
treasure, and none shall redeem it
because of the curse of the land.

20 And the day shall come that
they shall hide up their treasures,
because they have set their hearts
upon riches; and because they have
set their hearts upon their riches,
and will hide up their treasures
when they shall flee before their
enemies; because they will not
hide them up unto me, cursed be
they and also their treasures; and
in that day shall they be smitten,
saith the Lord.

21 Behold ye, the people of this
great city, and hearken unto my
words; yea, hearken unto the words
which the Lord saith; for behold, he
saith that ye are cursed because
of your riches, and also are your
riches cursed because ye have set
your hearts upon them, and have
not hearkened unto the words of
him who gave them unto you.

22 Ye do not remember the Lord
your God in the things with which
he hath blessed you, but ye do always remember your riches, not to
thank the Lord your God for them;
yea, your hearts are not drawn out
unto the Lord, but they do swell
with great pride, unto boasting,
and unto great swelling, envyings, strifes, malice, persecutions,
and murders, and all manner of
iniquities.

23 For this cause hath the Lord

that ye do cast out the prophets,
and do mock them, and cast stones
at them, and do slay them, and do
all manner of iniquity unto them,
even as they did of old time.

25 And now when ye talk, ye say:
If our days had been in the days of
our fathers of old, we would not
have slain the prophets; we would
not have stoned them, and cast
them out.

26 Behold ye are worse than they;
for as the Lord liveth, if a prophet
come among you and declareth unto
you the word of the Lord, which testifieth of your sins and iniquities,
ye are angry with him, and cast him
out and seek all manner of ways to
destroy him; yea, you will say that
he is a false prophet, and that he
is a sinner, and of the devil, because he testifieth that your deeds
are evil.

27 But behold, if a man shall come
among you and shall say: Do this,
and there is no iniquity; do that and
ye shall not suffer; yea, he will say:
Walk after the pride of your own
hearts; yea, walk after the pride of
your eyes, and do whatsoever your
heart desirethâ€”and if a man shall
come among you and say this, ye
will receive him, and say that he
is a prophet.

28 Yea, ye will lift him up, and ye
will give unto him of your substance;
ye will give unto him of your gold,
