and behold, at that day, if ye shall
spurn at his doings he will cause
that it shall soon overtake you.

5 Wo unto him that spurneth at
the doings of the Lord; yea, wo unto
him that shall deny the Christ and
his works!

6 Yea, wo unto him that shall deny
the revelations of the Lord, and that
shall say the Lord no longer worketh
by revelation, or by prophecy, or by
gifts, or by tongues, or by healings,
or by the power of the Holy Ghost!

7 Yea, and wo unto him that shall
say at that day, to get gain, that there
can be no miracle wrought by Jesus
Christ; for he that doeth this shall
become like unto the son of perdition, for whom there was no mercy,
according to the word of Christ!

8 Yea, and ye need not any longer
hiss, nor spurn, nor make game of
the Jews, nor any of the remnant
of the house of Israel; for behold,
the Lord remembereth his covenant
unto them, and he will do unto
them according to that which he
hath sworn.

9 Therefore ye need not suppose
that ye can turn the right hand of
the Lord unto the left, that he may
not execute judgment unto the fulfilling
of the covenant which he
hath made unto the house of Israel.

CHAPTER 30

The latter-day Gentiles are commanded
to repent, come unto Christ, and be numbered with the house of Israel. About
A.D. 34-35.

Hearken, O ye Gentiles, and hear
the words of Jesus Christ, the Son
of the living God, which he hath
commanded me that I should speak
concerning you, for, behold he commandeth me that I should write,
saying:

2 Turn, all ye Gentiles, from your
wicked ways; and repent of your
evil doings, of your lyings and deceivings, and of your whoredoms,
and of your secret abominations,
and your idolatries, and of your
murders, and your priestcrafts,
and your envyings, and your strifes,
and from all your wickedness and
abominations, and come unto me,
and be baptized in my name, that ye
may receive a remission of your sins,
and be filled with the Holy Ghost,
that ye may be numbered with
my people who are of the house of
Israel.
