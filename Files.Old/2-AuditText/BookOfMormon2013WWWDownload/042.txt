looked and beheld a tree; and it was
like unto the tree which my father
had seen; and the beauty thereof
was far beyond, yea, exceeding
of all beauty; and the whiteness
thereof did exceed the whiteness
of the driven snow.

9 And it came to pass after I had
seen the tree, I said unto the Spirit:
I behold thou hast shown unto me
the tree which is precious above all.

10 And he said unto me: What
desirest thou?

11 And I said unto him: To know
the interpretation thereofâ€”for I
spake unto him as a man speaketh;
for I beheld that he was in the
form of a man; yet nevertheless, I
knew that it was the Spirit of the
Lord; and he spake unto me as a
man speaketh with another.

12 And it came to pass that he said
unto me: Look! And I looked as if to
look upon him, and I saw him not; for
he had gone from before my presence.

13 And it came to pass that I
looked and beheld the great city of
Jerusalem, and also other cities. And
I beheld the city of Nazareth; and
in the city of Nazareth I beheld a
virgin, and she was exceedingly
fair and white.

14 And it came to pass that I saw
the heavens open; and an angel
came down and stood before me;
and he said unto me: Nephi, what
beholdest thou?

15 And I said unto him: A virgin,

17 And I said unto him: I know

18 And he said unto me: Behold,
the virgin whom thou seest is the
mother of the Son of God, after the
manner of the flesh.

19 And it came to pass that I beheld
that she was carried away in
the Spirit; and after she had been
carried away in the Spirit for the
space of a time the angel spake unto
me, saying: Look!

20 And I looked and beheld the
virgin again, bearing a child in
her arms.

21 And the angel said unto me:
Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even
the Son of the Eternal Father!
Knowest thou the meaning of the
tree which thy father saw?

22 And I answered him, saying:
Yea, it is the love of God, which
sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts
of the children of men; wherefore,
it is the most desirable above all
things.

23 And he spake unto me, saying:
Yea, and the most joyous to the
soul.

24 And after he had said these
words, he said unto me: Look! And I
looked, and I beheld the Son of God
going forth among the children of
men; and I saw many fall down at
his feet and worship him.

25 And it came to pass that I beheld
that the rod of iron, which my
father had seen, was the word of
God, which led to the fountain of
living waters, or to the tree of life;
