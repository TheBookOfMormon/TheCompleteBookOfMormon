righteousness; and their garments
were white even like unto the Lamb
of God. And the angel said unto me:
These are made white in the blood
of the Lamb, because of their faith
in him.

12 And I, Nephi, also saw many of
the fourth generation who passed
away in righteousness.

13 And it came to pass that I saw
the multitudes of the earth gathered
together.

14 And the angel said unto me:
Behold thy seed, and also the seed
of thy brethren.

15 And it came to pass that I looked
and beheld the people of my seed
gathered together in multitudes
against the seed of my brethren;
and they were gathered together
to battle.

16 And the angel spake unto me,
saying: Behold the fountain of
filthy water which thy father saw;
yea, even the river of which he
spake; and the depths thereof are
the depths of hell.

17 And the mists of darkness are
the temptations of the devil, which
blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth
the hearts of the children of men,
and leadeth them away into broad
roads, that they perish and are lost.

18 And the large and spacious
building, which thy father saw, is
vain imaginations and the pride
of the children of men. And a great
and a terrible gulf divideth them;
yea, even the word of the justice of
the Eternal God, and the Messiah
who is the Lamb of God, of whom
the Holy Ghost beareth record,
from the beginning of the world
until this time, and from this time
henceforth and forever.

19 And while the angel spake
these words, I beheld and saw that
the seed of my brethren did contend
against my seed, according to
the word of the angel; and because
of the pride of my seed, and the
temptations of the devil, I beheld
that the seed of my brethren did
overpower the people of my seed.

20 And it came to pass that I beheld,
and saw the people of the
seed of my brethren that they had
overcome my seed; and they went
forth in multitudes upon the face
of the land.

21 And I saw them gathered together
in multitudes; and I saw wars
and rumors of wars among them;
and in wars and rumors of wars I
saw many generations pass away.

22 And the angel said unto me:
Behold these shall dwindle in
unbelief.

23 And it came to pass that I beheld,
after they had dwindled in
unbelief they became a dark, and
loathsome, and a filthy people,
full of idleness and all manner of
abominations.

CHAPTER 13

Nephi sees in vision the church of the
devil set up among the Gentiles, the
discovery and colonizing of America,
the loss of many plain and precious
parts of the Bible, the resultant state
of gentile apostasy, the restoration of
the gospel, the coming forth of latter-day
scripture, and the building up of
Zion. About 600-592 B.C.
