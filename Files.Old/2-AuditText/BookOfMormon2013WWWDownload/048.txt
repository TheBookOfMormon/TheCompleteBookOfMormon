book, which were plain unto the understanding
of the children of men,
according to the plainness which
is in the Lamb of God—because of
these things which are taken away
out of the gospel of the Lamb, an
exceedingly great many do stumble,
yea, insomuch that Satan hath
great power over them.

30 Nevertheless, thou beholdest
that the Gentiles who have gone
forth out of captivity, and have been
lifted up by the power of God above
all other nations, upon the face of
the land which is choice above all
other lands, which is the land that
the Lord God hath covenanted with
thy father that his seed should have
for the land of their inheritance;
wherefore, thou seest that the Lord
God will not suffer that the Gentiles
will utterly destroy the mixture
of thy seed, which are among thy
brethren.

31 Neither will he suffer that the
Gentiles shall destroy the seed of
thy brethren.

32 Neither will the Lord God suffer
that the Gentiles shall forever

the Lamb.

35 For, behold, saith the Lamb: I
will manifest myself unto thy seed,
that they shall write many things

and after thy seed shall be destroyed,
