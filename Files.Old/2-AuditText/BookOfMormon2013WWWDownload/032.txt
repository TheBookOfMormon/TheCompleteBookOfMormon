Zoram had made an oath unto us,
our fears did cease concerning him.

38 And it came to pass that we
took the plates of brass and the servant
of Laban, and departed into
the wilderness, and journeyed unto
the tent of our father.

CHAPTER 5

Sariah complains against Lehi—Both
rejoice over the return of their sons—
They offer sacrifices—The plates of
brass contain writings of Moses and the
prophets—The plates identify Lehi as a
descendant of Joseph—Lehi prophesies
concerning his seed and the preservation
of the plates. About 600-592 B.C.

And it came to pass that after we
had come down into the wilderness
unto our father, behold, he was filled
with joy, and also my mother, Sariah,
was exceedingly glad, for she
truly had mourned because of us.

2 For she had supposed that we
had perished in the wilderness; and
she also had complained against
my father, telling him that he was
a visionary man; saying: Behold
thou hast led us forth from the land
of our inheritance, and my sons
are no more, and we perish in the
wilderness.

3 And after this manner of language
had my mother complained
against my father.

4 And it had come to pass that
my father spake unto her, saying:
I know that I am a visionary man;
for if I had not seen the things of
God in a vision I should not have
known the goodness of God, but
had tarried at Jerusalem, and had
perished with my brethren.

5 But behold, I have obtained a
land of promise, in the which things
I do rejoice; yea, and I know that
the Lord will deliver my sons out of
the hands of Laban, and bring them
down again unto us in the wilderness.

6 And after this manner of language
did my father, Lehi, comfort
my mother, Sariah, concerning us,
while we journeyed in the wilderness
up to the land of Jerusalem,
to obtain the record of the Jews.

7 And when we had returned to
the tent of my father, behold their
joy was full, and my mother was
comforted.

8 And she spake, saying: Now I
know of a surety that the Lord hath
commanded my husband to flee
into the wilderness; yea, and I also
know of a surety that the Lord hath
protected my sons, and delivered
them out of the hands of Laban,
and given them power whereby
they could accomplish the thing
which the Lord hath commanded
them. And after this manner of
language did she speak.

9 And it came to pass that they did
rejoice exceedingly, and did offer
sacrifice and burnt offerings unto
the Lord; and they gave thanks
unto the God of Israel.

10 And after they had given thanks
unto the God of Israel, my father,
Lehi, took the records which were
engraven upon the plates of brass,
and he did search them from the
beginning.

11 And he beheld that they did
contain the five books of Moses,
which gave an account of the creation
of the world, and also of Adam
and Eve, who were our first parents;
