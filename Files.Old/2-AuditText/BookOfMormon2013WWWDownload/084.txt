my mouth unto their brethren who
are the fruit of thy loins; and the
weakness of their words will I make
strong in their faith, unto the remembering
of my covenant which
I made unto thy fathers.

22 And now, behold, my son Joseph,
after this manner did my
father of old prophesy.

23 Wherefore, because of this covenant
thou art blessed; for thy seed
shall not be destroyed, for they shall
hearken unto the words of the book.

24 And there shall rise up one
mighty among them, who shall do
much good, both in word and in
deed, being an instrument in the
hands of God, with exceeding faith,
to work mighty wonders, and do
that thing which is great in the sight
of God, unto the bringing to pass
much restoration unto the house
of Israel, and unto the seed of thy
brethren.

25 And now, blessed art thou,
Joseph. Behold, thou art little;
wherefore hearken unto the words
of thy brother, Nephi, and it shall
be done unto thee even according
to the words which I have spoken.
Remember the words of thy dying
father. Amen.

CHAPTER 4

Lehi counsels and blesses his posterity—
He dies and is buried—Nephi
glories in the goodness of God—Nephi
puts his trust in the Lord forever. About
588-570 B.C.

And now, I, Nephi, speak concerning
the prophecies of which my father
hath spoken, concerning Joseph,
who was carried into Egypt.

2 For behold, he truly prophesied
concerning all his seed. And
the prophecies which he wrote,
there are not many greater. And he
prophesied concerning us, and our
future generations; and they are
written upon the plates of brass.

3 Wherefore, after my father had
made an end of speaking concerning
the prophecies of Joseph, he called
the children of Laman, his sons, and
his daughters, and said unto them:
Behold, my sons, and my daughters,
who are the sons and the daughters
of my firstborn, I would that
ye should give ear unto my words.

4 For the Lord God hath said that:
Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments
ye shall prosper in the
land; and inasmuch as ye will not
keep my commandments ye shall
be cut off from my presence.

5 But behold, my sons and my
daughters, I cannot go down to my
grave save I should leave a blessing
upon you; for behold, I know that
if ye are brought up in the way ye
should go ye will not depart from it.

6 Wherefore, if ye are cursed,
behold, I leave my blessing upon
you, that the cursing may be taken
from you and be answered upon
the heads of your parents.

7 Wherefore, because of my blessing
the Lord God will not suffer
that ye shall perish; wherefore, he
will be merciful unto you and unto
your seed forever.

8 And it came to pass that after my
father had made an end of speaking
to the sons and daughters of Laman,
he caused the sons and daughters of
Lemuel to be brought before him.

9 And he spake unto them, saying:
