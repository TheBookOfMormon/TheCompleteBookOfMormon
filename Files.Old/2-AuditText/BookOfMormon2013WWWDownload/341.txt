our weapons of war; we will deliver
them up unto you, but we will not
suffer ourselves to take an oath
unto you, which we know that we
shall break, and also our children;
but take our weapons of war, and
suffer that we may depart into the
wilderness; otherwise we will retain our swords, and we will perish
or conquer.

9 Behold, we are not of your faith;
we do not believe that it is God that
has delivered us into your hands; but
we believe that it is your cunning
that has preserved you from our
swords. Behold, it is your breastplates and your shields that have
preserved you.

10 And now when Zerahemnah
had made an end of speaking these
words, Moroni returned the sword
and the weapons of war, which he
had received, unto Zerahemnah,
saying: Behold, we will end the
conflict.

11 Now I cannot recall the words
which I have spoken, therefore
as the Lord liveth, ye shall not
depart except ye depart with an
oath that ye will not return again
against us to war. Now as ye are in
our hands we will spill your blood
upon the ground, or ye shall submit to the conditions which I have
proposed.

12 And now when Moroni had said
these words, Zerahemnah retained
his sword, and he was angry with
Moroni, and he rushed forward
that he might slay Moroni; but as
he raised his sword, behold, one of
Moroni's soldiers smote it even to
the earth, and it broke by the hilt;
and he also smote Zerahemnah that
he took off his scalp and it fell to
the earth. And Zerahemnah withdrew from before them into the
midst of his soldiers.

13 And it came to pass that the
soldier who stood by, who smote
off the scalp of Zerahemnah, took
up the scalp from off the ground by
the hair, and laid it upon the point
of his sword, and stretched it forth
unto them, saying unto them with
a loud voice:

14 Even as this scalp has fallen
to the earth, which is the scalp of
your chief, so shall ye fall to the
earth except ye will deliver up your
weapons of war and depart with a
covenant of peace.

15 Now there were many, when
they heard these words and saw
the scalp which was upon the
sword, that were struck with fear;
and many came forth and threw
down their weapons of war at
the feet of Moroni, and entered
into a covenant of peace. And as
many as entered into a covenant
they suffered to depart into the
wilderness.

16 Now it came to pass that Zerahemnah
was exceedingly wroth,
and he did stir up the remainder
of his soldiers to anger, to contend more powerfully against the
Nephites.

17 And now Moroni was angry,
because of the stubbornness of
the Lamanites; therefore he commanded his people that they should
fall upon them and slay them. And
it came to pass that they began to
slay them; yea, and the Lamanites
did contend with their swords and
their might.

18 But behold, their naked skins
and their bare heads were exposed
to the sharp swords of the Nephites;
yea, behold they were pierced and
smitten, yea, and did fall exceedingly fast before the swords of the
Nephites; and they began to be
swept down, even as the soldier of
Moroni had prophesied.

19 Now Zerahemnah, when he
saw that they were all about to
be destroyed, cried mightily unto
Moroni, promising that he would
covenant and also his people with
them, if they would spare the remainder of their lives, that they
