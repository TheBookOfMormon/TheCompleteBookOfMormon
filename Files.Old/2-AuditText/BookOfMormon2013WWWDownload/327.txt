things of myself, but it is the Spirit
of God which is in me which maketh
these things known unto me;
for if I had not been born of God I
should not have known these things.

7 But behold, the Lord in his great
mercy sent his angel to declare
unto me that I must stop the work
of destruction among his people;
yea, and I have seen an angel face
to face, and he spake with me, and
his voice was as thunder, and it
shook the whole earth.

8 And it came to pass that I was
three days and three nights in
the most bitter pain and anguish
of soul; and never, until I did cry
out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for
mercy, did I receive a remission of
my sins. But behold, I did cry unto
him and I did find peace to my soul.

9 And now, my son, I have told
you this that ye may learn wisdom, that ye may learn of me that
there is no other way or means
whereby man can be saved, only in
and through Christ. Behold, he is
the life and the light of the world.
Behold, he is the word of truth and
righteousness.

10 And now, as ye have begun to
teach the word even so I would that
ye should continue to teach; and I
would that ye would be diligent

11 See that ye are not lifted up
unto pride; yea, see that ye do not
boast in your own wisdom, nor of
your much strength.

12 Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle
all your passions, that ye may be

do, for ye have seen that they pray to
be heard of men, and to be praised
for their wisdom.

14 Do not say: O God, I thank thee
that we are better than our brethren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive
my unworthiness, and remember
my brethren in mercy—yea,
acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times.

15 And may the Lord bless your
soul, and receive you at the last day
into his kingdom, to sit down in
peace. Now go, my son, and teach
the word unto this people. Be sober. My son, farewell.



The commandments of Alma to his
son Corianton.
Comprising chapters 39 through 42.

CHAPTER 39

Sexual sin is an abomination—
Corianton's sins kept the Zoramites from
receiving the word—Christ's redemption
is retroactive in saving the faithful who
preceded it. About 74 B.C.

And now, my son, I have somewhat
more to say unto thee than what I
said unto thy brother; for behold,
have ye not observed the steadiness
of thy brother, his faithfulness, and
his diligence in keeping the commandments of God? Behold, has he
not set a good example for thee?

2 For thou didst not give so much
heed unto my words as did thy
brother, among the people of the
Zoramites. Now this is what I have
against thee; thou didst go on unto
