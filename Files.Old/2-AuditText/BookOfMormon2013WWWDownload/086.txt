day, and he hath given me knowledge by
visions in the night-time.

24 And by day have I waxed bold
in mighty prayer before him; yea,
my voice have I sent up on high;
and angels came down and ministered
unto me.

25 And upon the wings of his Spirit
hath my body been carried away
upon exceedingly high mountains.
And mine eyes have beheld great
things, yea, even too great for man;
therefore I was bidden that I should
not write them.

26 O then, if I have seen so great
things, if the Lord in his condescension
unto the children of men hath
visited men in so much mercy,
why should my heart weep and my
soul linger in the valley of sorrow,
and my flesh waste away, and my
strength slacken, because of mine
afflictions?

27 And why should I yield to
sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why
should I give way to temptations,
that the evil one have place in my
heart to destroy my peace and afflict
my soul? Why am I angry because
of mine enemy?

28 Awake, my soul! No longer
droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart,
and give place no more for the enemy
of my soul.

29 Do not anger again because of
mine enemies. Do not slacken my
strength because of mine afflictions.

30 Rejoice, O my heart, and cry
unto the Lord, and say: O Lord, I
will praise thee forever; yea, my
soul will rejoice in thee, my God,
and the rock of my salvation.

31 O Lord, wilt thou redeem my
soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of
the hands of mine enemies? Wilt
thou make me that I may shake at
the appearance of sin?

32 May the gates of hell be shut
continually before me, because that
my heart is broken and my spirit
is contrite! O Lord, wilt thou not
shut the gates of thy righteousness
before me, that I may walk in the
path of the low valley, that I may
be strict in the plain road!

33 O Lord, wilt thou encircle me
around in the robe of thy righteousness!
O Lord, wilt thou make
a way for mine escape before mine
enemies! Wilt thou make my path
straight before me! Wilt thou not
place a stumbling block in my wayâ€”
but that thou wouldst clear my way
before me, and hedge not up my
way, but the ways of mine enemy.

34 O Lord, I have trusted in thee,
and I will trust in thee forever. I
will not put my trust in the arm
of flesh; for I know that cursed is
he that putteth his trust in the
arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he that
putteth his trust in man or maketh
flesh his arm.

35 Yea, I know that God will give
liberally to him that asketh. Yea,
my God will give me, if I ask not
amiss; therefore I will lift up my
voice unto thee; yea, I will cry
unto thee, my God, the rock of my
righteousness. Behold, my voice
