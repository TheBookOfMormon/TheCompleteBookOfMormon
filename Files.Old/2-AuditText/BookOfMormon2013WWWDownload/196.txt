that the time shall come when it
shall no more be expedient to keep
the law of Moses.

28 And moreover, I say unto you,
that salvation doth not come by
the law alone; and were it not for
the atonement, which God himself
shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people, that they must
unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of Moses.

29 And now I say unto you that
it was expedient that there should
be a law given to the children of
Israel, yea, even a very strict law;
for they were a stiffnecked people,
quick to do iniquity, and slow to
remember the Lord their God;

30 Therefore there was a law given
them, yea, a law of performances
and of ordinances, a law which they
were to observe strictly from day to
day, to keep them in remembrance
of God and their duty towards him.

31 But behold, I say unto you,
that all these things were types of
things to come.

32 And now, did they understand
the law? I say unto you, Nay, they
did not all understand the law;
and this because of the hardness
of their hearts; for they understood
not that there could not any man
be saved except it were through
the redemption of God.

33 For behold, did not Moses prophesy
unto them concerning the
coming of the Messiah, and that
God should redeem his people? Yea,
and even all the prophets who have
prophesied ever since the world
began—have they not spoken more
or less concerning these things?

34 Have they not said that God
himself should come down among
the children of men, and take upon
him the form of man, and go forth
in mighty power upon the face of
the earth?

35 Yea, and have they not said also
that he should bring to pass the
resurrection of the dead, and that
he, himself, should be oppressed
and afflicted?

CHAPTER 14

Isaiah speaks messianically—The
Messiah's humiliation and sufferings
are set forth—He makes His soul an
offering for sin and makes intercession
for transgressors—Compare Isaiah 53.
About 148 B.C.

Yea, even doth not Isaiah say: Who
hath believed our report, and to
whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

2 For he shall grow up before him
as a tender plant, and as a root out
of dry ground; he hath no form
nor comeliness; and when we shall
see him there is no beauty that we
should desire him.

3 He is despised and rejected of
men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as
it were our faces from him; he was
despised, and we esteemed him not.

4 Surely he has borne our griefs,
and carried our sorrows; yet we did
esteem him stricken, smitten of God,
and afflicted.
