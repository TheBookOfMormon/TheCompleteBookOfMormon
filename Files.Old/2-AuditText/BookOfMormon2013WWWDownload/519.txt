came down out of the mount, and
he did put forth the stones into the
vessels which were prepared, one
in each end thereof; and behold,
they did give light unto the vessels.

3 And thus the Lord caused stones
to shine in darkness, to give light
unto men, women, and children, that
they might not cross the great waters
in darkness.

4 And it came to pass that when
they had prepared all manner of
food, that thereby they might subsist upon the water, and also food for
their flocks and herds, and whatsoever beast or animal or fowl that
they should carry with themâ€”and
it came to pass that when they had
done all these things they got aboard
of their vessels or barges, and set
forth into the sea, commending
themselves unto the Lord their God.

5 And it came to pass that the Lord
God caused that there should be a
furious wind blow upon the face
of the waters, towards the promised land; and thus they were tossed
upon the waves of the sea before
the wind.

6 And it came to pass that they
were many times buried in the
depths of the sea, because of the
mountain waves which broke upon
them, and also the great and terrible tempests which were caused by
the fierceness of the wind.

7 And it came to pass that when
they were buried in the deep there
was no water that could hurt them,
their vessels being tight like unto
a dish, and also they were tight
like unto the ark of Noah; therefore when they were encompassed
about by many waters they did cry
unto the Lord, and he did bring
them forth again upon the top of
the waters.

8 And it came to pass that the wind
did never cease to blow towards
the promised land while they were
upon the waters; and thus they were
driven forth before the wind.

9 And they did sing praises unto
the Lord; yea, the brother of Jared
did sing praises unto the Lord, and
he did thank and praise the Lord
all the day long; and when the night
came, they did not cease to praise
the Lord.

10 And thus they were driven forth;
and no monster of the sea could
break them, neither whale that
could mar them; and they did have
light continually, whether it was
above the water or under the water.

11 And thus they were driven
forth, three hundred and forty and
four days upon the water.

12 And they did land upon the
shore of the promised land. And
when they had set their feet upon
the shores of the promised land they
bowed themselves down upon the
face of the land, and did humble
themselves before the Lord, and did
shed tears of joy before the Lord,
because of the multitude of his
tender mercies over them.

13 And it came to pass that they
went forth upon the face of the
land, and began to till the earth.

14 And Jared had four sons; and
they were called Jacom, and Gilgah,
and Mahah, and Orihah.

15 And the brother of Jared also
begat sons and daughters.

16 And the friends of Jared and
his brother were in number about
twenty and two souls; and they
also begat sons and daughters before they came to the promised
land; and therefore they began to
be many.

17 And they were taught to walk
