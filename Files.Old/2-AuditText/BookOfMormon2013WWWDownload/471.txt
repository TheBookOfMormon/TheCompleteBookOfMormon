Ghost through me upon the Gentiles,
which blessing upon the Gentiles
shall make them mighty above all,
unto the scattering of my people,
O house of Israel.

28 And they shall be a scourge
unto the people of this land. Nevertheless, when they shall have
received the fulness of my gospel,
then if they shall harden their hearts
against me I will return their iniquities upon their own heads, saith the
Father.

29 And I will remember the covenant which I have made with my
people; and I have covenanted with
them that I would gather them
together in mine own due time,
that I would give unto them again
the land of their fathers for their
inheritance, which is the land of
Jerusalem, which is the promised
land unto them forever, saith the
Father.

30 And it shall come to pass that
the time cometh, when the fulness
of my gospel shall be preached
unto them;

31 And they shall believe in me,
that I am Jesus Christ, the Son of
God, and shall pray unto the Father
in my name.

32 Then shall their watchmen lift
up their voice, and with the voice
together shall they sing; for they
shall see eye to eye.

33 Then will the Father gather
them together again, and give unto
them Jerusalem for the land of
their inheritance.

34 Then shall they break forth
into joyâ€”Sing together, ye waste
places of Jerusalem; for the Father
hath comforted his people, he hath
redeemed Jerusalem.

35 The Father hath made bare his
holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth
shall see the salvation of the Father;
and the Father and I are one.

36 And then shall be brought to
pass that which is written: Awake,
awake again, and put on thy strength,
O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city,
for henceforth there shall no more
come into thee the uncircumcised
and the unclean.

37 Shake thyself from the dust;
arise, sit down, O Jerusalem; loose
thyself from the bands of thy neck,
O captive daughter of Zion.

38 For thus saith the Lord: Ye
have sold yourselves for naught,
and ye shall be redeemed without
money.

39 Verily, verily, I say unto you,
that my people shall know my
name; yea, in that day they shall
know that I am he that doth speak.

40 And then shall they say: How
beautiful upon the mountains are
the feet of him that bringeth good
tidings unto them, that publisheth
peace; that bringeth good tidings
unto them of good, that publisheth
salvation; that saith unto Zion: Thy
God reigneth!

41 And then shall a cry go forth:
Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from
thence, touch not that which is unclean; go ye out of the midst of her;
be ye clean that bear the vessels
of the Lord.
