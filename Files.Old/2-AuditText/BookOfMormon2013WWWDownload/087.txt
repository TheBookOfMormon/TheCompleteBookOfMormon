shall forever ascend up unto thee,
my rock and mine everlasting God.
Amen.

CHAPTER 5

The Nephites separate themselves from
the Lamanites, keep the law of Moses,
and build a templeâ€”Because of their
unbelief, the Lamanites are cut off from
the presence of the Lord, are cursed,
and become a scourge unto the Nephites.
About 588-559 B.C.

Behold, it came to pass that I,
Nephi, did cry much unto the Lord
my God, because of the anger of
my brethren.

2 But behold, their anger did increase
against me, insomuch that
they did seek to take away my life.

3 Yea, they did murmur against me,
saying: Our younger brother thinks
to rule over us; and we have had
much trial because of him; wherefore,
now let us slay him, that we
may not be afflicted more because
of his words. For behold, we will
not have him to be our ruler; for it
belongs unto us, who are the elder
brethren, to rule over this people.

4 Now I do not write upon these
plates all the words which they
murmured against me. But it sufficeth
me to say, that they did seek
to take away my life.

5 And it came to pass that the
Lord did warn me, that I, Nephi,
should depart from them and flee
into the wilderness, and all those
who would go with me.

6 Wherefore, it came to pass that
I, Nephi, did take my family, and
also Zoram and his family, and Sam,
mine elder brother and his family,
and Jacob and Joseph, my younger
brethren, and also my sisters, and

unto my words.

7 And we did take our tents and
whatsoever things were possible for
us, and did journey in the wilderness
for the space of many days. And after
we had journeyed for the space
of many days we did pitch our tents.

8 And my people would that we
should call the name of the place
Nephi; wherefore, we did call it
Nephi.

9 And all those who were with me
did take upon them to call themselves
the people of Nephi.

10 And we did observe to keep the
judgments, and the statutes, and
the commandments of the Lord in
all things, according to the law
of Moses.

11 And the Lord was with us; and
we did prosper exceedingly; for we
did sow seed, and we did reap again
in abundance. And we began to raise
flocks, and herds, and animals of
every kind.

12 And I, Nephi, had also brought
the records which were engraven
upon the plates of brass; and also
the ball, or compass, which was
prepared for my father by the hand
of the Lord, according to that which
is written.

13 And it came to pass that we
began to prosper exceedingly, and
to multiply in the land.

14 And I, Nephi, did take the sword
of Laban, and after the manner
