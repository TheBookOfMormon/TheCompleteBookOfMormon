20 It shall never be inhabited,
neither shall it be dwelt in from
generation to generation: neither
shall the Arabian pitch tent there;
neither shall the shepherds make
their fold there.

21 But wild beasts of the desert
shall lie there; and their houses
shall be full of doleful creatures;
and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs
shall dance there.

22 And the wild beasts of the islands
shall cry in their desolate houses, and
dragons in their pleasant palaces;
and her time is near to come, and
her day shall not be prolonged. For I
will destroy her speedily; yea, for
I will be merciful unto my people,
but the wicked shall perish.

CHAPTER 24

Israel will be gathered and will enjoy
millennial rest—Lucifer was cast out
of heaven for rebellion—Israel will triumph
over Babylon (the world)—Compare
Isaiah 14. About 559-545 B.C.

For the Lord will have mercy on
Jacob, and will yet choose Israel,
and set them in their own land; and
the strangers shall be joined with
them, and they shall cleave to the
house of Jacob.

2 And the people shall take them
and bring them to their place; yea,
from far unto the ends of the earth;
and they shall return to their lands
of promise. And the house of Israel
shall possess them, and the land
of the Lord shall be for servants
and handmaids; and they shall take
them captives unto whom they were

3 And it shall come to pass in that
day that the Lord shall give thee
rest, from thy sorrow, and from thy

4 And it shall come to pass in
that day, that thou shalt take up
this proverb against the king of
Babylon, and say: How hath the
oppressor ceased, the golden city
ceased!

5 The Lord hath broken the staff
of the wicked, the scepters of the
rulers.

6 He who smote the people in
wrath with a continual stroke, he
that ruled the nations in anger, is
persecuted, and none hindereth.

7 The whole earth is at rest, and is
quiet; they break forth into singing.

8 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee,
and also the cedars of Lebanon,
saying: Since thou art laid down no
feller is come up against us.

9 Hell from beneath is moved for
thee to meet thee at thy coming; it
stirreth up the dead for thee, even
all the chief ones of the earth; it
hath raised up from their thrones
all the kings of the nations.

10 All they shall speak and say unto
thee: Art thou also become weak
as we? Art thou become like unto us?

11 Thy pomp is brought down to
the grave; the noise of thy viols is
not heard; the worm is spread under
thee, and the worms cover thee.

12 How art thou fallen from
heaven, O Lucifer, son of the
morning! Art thou cut down to
the ground, which did weaken the
nations!

13 For thou hast said in thy heart:
I will ascend into heaven, I will
