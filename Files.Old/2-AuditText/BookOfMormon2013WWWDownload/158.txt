THE BOOK OF ENOS

Enos prays mightily and gains a remission
of his sins—The voice of the
Lord comes into his mind, promising
salvation for the Lamanites in a future
day—The Nephites sought to reclaim
the Lamanites—Enos rejoices in his
Redeemer. About 420 B.C.

Behold, it came to pass that
I, Enos, knowing my father
that he was a just man—for
he taught me in his language, and
also in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord—and blessed be
the name of my God for it—

2 And I will tell you of the wrestle
which I had before God, before
I received a remission of my sins.

3 Behold, I went to hunt beasts in

had often heard my father speak
concerning eternal life, and the joy
of the saints, sunk deep into my
