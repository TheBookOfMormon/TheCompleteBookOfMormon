CHAPTER 9

Messengers find the chief judge dead
at the judgment seat—They are imprisoned
and later released—By inspiration
Nephi identifies Seantum as the murderer—
Nephi is accepted by some as a
prophet. About 23-21 B.C.

Behold, now it came to pass that
when Nephi had spoken these
words, certain men who were among
them ran to the judgment-seat; yea,
even there were five who went,
and they said among themselves, as
they went:

2 Behold, now we will know of a
surety whether this man be a prophet
and God hath commanded him to
prophesy such marvelous things
unto us. Behold, we do not believe
that he hath; yea, we do not believe
that he is a prophet; nevertheless,
if this thing which he has said concerning the chief judge be true, that
he be dead, then will we believe
that the other words which he has
spoken are true.

3 And it came to pass that they ran
in their might, and came in unto
the judgment-seat; and behold, the
chief judge had fallen to the earth,
and did lie in his blood.

4 And now behold, when they saw
this they were astonished exceedingly, insomuch that they fell to
the earth; for they had not believed
the words which Nephi had spoken
concerning the chief judge.

5 But now, when they saw they
believed, and fear came upon them
lest all the judgments which Nephi
had spoken should come upon the
people; therefore they did quake,
and had fallen to the earth.

6 Now, immediately when the
judge had been murdered—he being
stabbed by his brother by a garb of
secrecy, and he fled, and the servants
ran and told the people, raising the
cry of murder among them;

7 And behold the people did gather
themselves together unto the place
of the judgment-seat—and behold,
to their astonishment they saw
those five men who had fallen to
the earth.

8 And now behold, the people
knew nothing concerning the multitude who had gathered together
at the garden of Nephi; therefore
they said among themselves: These
men are they who have murdered
the judge, and God has smitten them
that they could not flee from us.

9 And it came to pass that they laid
hold on them, and bound them and
cast them into prison. And there
was a proclamation sent abroad
that the judge was slain, and that
the murderers had been taken and
were cast into prison.

10 And it came to pass that on the
morrow the people did assemble
themselves together to mourn and
to fast, at the burial of the great
chief judge who had been slain.

11 And thus also those judges who
were at the garden of Nephi, and
heard his words, were also gathered
together at the burial.

12 And it came to pass that they
inquired among the people, saying:
Where are the five who were sent to
inquire concerning the chief judge
whether he was dead? And they answered and said: Concerning this
five whom ye say ye have sent, we
know not; but there are five who are
the murderers, whom we have cast
into prison.

13 And it came to pass that the
judges desired that they should be
brought; and they were brought,
and behold they were the five who
were sent; and behold the judges inquired of them to know concerning
the matter, and they told them all
that they had done, saying:

14 We ran and came to the place
of the judgment-seat, and when
we saw all things even as Nephi
had testified, we were astonished
