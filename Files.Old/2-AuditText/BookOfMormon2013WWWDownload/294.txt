the Lamanites saw that they could
not overpower the Nephites they returned again to their own land; and
many of them came over to dwell in
the land of Ishmael and the land
of Nephi, and did join themselves
to the people of God, who were the
people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

14 And they did also bury their
weapons of war, according as their
brethren had, and they began to be
a righteous people; and they did
walk in the ways of the Lord, and
did observe to keep his commandments and his statutes.

15 Yea, and they did keep the law
of Moses; for it was expedient that
they should keep the law of Moses
as yet, for it was not all fulfilled. But
notwithstanding the law of Moses,
they did look forward to the coming
of Christ, considering that the law
of Moses was a type of his coming,
and believing that they must keep
those outward performances until
the time that he should be revealed
unto them.

16 Now they did not suppose
that salvation came by the law
of Moses; but the law of Moses did
serve to strengthen their faith in
Christ; and thus they did retain a
hope through faith, unto eternal
salvation, relying upon the spirit
of prophecy, which spake of those
things to come.

17 And now behold, Ammon, and
Aaron, and Omner, and Himni,
and their brethren did rejoice exceedingly, for the success which
they had had among the Lamanites, seeing that the Lord had
granted unto them according to
their prayers, and that he had also
verified his word unto them in every
particular.

faithful are strengthened by the Lord
and are given knowledge—By faith
men may bring thousands of souls
unto repentance—God has all power
and comprehends all things.
About 90-77 B.C.

And now, these are the words of
Ammon to his brethren, which say
thus: My brothers and my brethren,
behold I say unto you, how great
reason have we to rejoice; for could
we have supposed when we started
from the land of Zarahemla that
God would have granted unto us
such great blessings?

2 And now, I ask, what great blessings has he bestowed upon us? Can
ye tell?

3 Behold, I answer for you; for
our brethren, the Lamanites, were
in darkness, yea, even in the darkest abyss, but behold, how many
of them are brought to behold the
marvelous light of God! And this is
the blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been
made instruments in the hands
of God to bring about this great
work.

4 Behold, thousands of them do
rejoice, and have been brought into
the fold of God.

5 Behold, the field was ripe, and
blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in
the sickle, and did reap with your
might, yea, all the day long did ye
labor; and behold the number of
your sheaves! And they shall be
