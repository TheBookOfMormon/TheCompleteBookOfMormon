prophet; every nation, kindred,
tongue and people shall be blessed.

18 And I, Nephi, have written these
things unto my people, that perhaps
I might persuade them that they
would remember the Lord their
Redeemer.

19 Wherefore, I speak unto all the
house of Israel, if it so be that they
should obtain these things.

20 For behold, I have workings in
the spirit, which doth weary me
even that all my joints are weak,
for those who are at Jerusalem; for
had not the Lord been merciful, to
show unto me concerning them,
even as he had prophets of old, I
should have perished also.

21 And he surely did show unto
the prophets of old all things concerning
them; and also he did show
unto many concerning us; wherefore,
it must needs be that we know
concerning them for they are written
upon the plates of brass.

22 Now it came to pass that I,
Nephi, did teach my brethren these
things; and it came to pass that I did
read many things to them, which
were engraven upon the plates of
brass, that they might know concerning
the doings of the Lord in
other lands, among people of old.

23 And I did read many things
unto them which were written
in the books of Moses; but that I
might more fully persuade them to
believe in the Lord their Redeemer
I did read unto them that which
was written by the prophet Isaiah;
for I did liken all scriptures unto
us, that it might be for our profit
and learning.

24 Wherefore I spake unto them,
saying: Hear ye the words of the
prophet, ye who are a remnant of
the house of Israel, a branch who
have been broken off; hear ye the
words of the prophet, which were
written unto all the house of Israel,
and liken them unto yourselves, that
ye may have hope as well as your
brethren from whom ye have been
broken off; for after this manner
has the prophet written.

CHAPTER 20

The Lord reveals His purposes to Israel—
Israel has been chosen in the
furnace of affliction and is to go forth
from Babylon—Compare Isaiah 48.
About 588-570 B.C.

Hearken and hear this, O house of
Jacob, who are called by the name of
Israel, and are come forth out of the
waters of Judah, or out of the waters
of baptism, who swear by the
name of the Lord, and make mention
of the God of Israel, yet they swear
not in truth nor in righteousness.

2 Nevertheless, they call themselves
of the holy city, but they do
not stay themselves upon the God
of Israel, who is the Lord of Hosts;
yea, the Lord of Hosts is his name.

3 Behold, I have declared the former
things from the beginning; and
they went forth out of my mouth,
and I showed them. I did show them
suddenly.

4 And I did it because I knew that
thou art obstinate, and thy neck is
an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;

5 And I have even from the beginning
declared to thee; before it came
