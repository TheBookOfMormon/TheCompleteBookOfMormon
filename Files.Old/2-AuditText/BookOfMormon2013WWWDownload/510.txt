were found by the people of Limhi,
which is called the Book of Ether.

3 And as I suppose that the first
part of this record, which speaks
concerning the creation of the
world, and also of Adam, and an
account from that time even to the
great tower, and whatsoever things
transpired among the children of
men until that time, is had among
the Jewsâ€”

4 Therefore I do not write those
things which transpired from the
days of Adam until that time; but
they are had upon the plates; and
whoso findeth them, the same will
have power that he may get the full
account.

5 But behold, I give not the full
account, but a part of the account
I give, from the tower down until
they were destroyed.

6 And on this wise do I give the
account. He that wrote this record
was Ether, and he was a descendant of Coriantor.

7 Coriantor was the son of Moron.

8 And Moron was the son of Ethem.

9 And Ethem was the son of Ahah.

10 And Ahah was the son of Seth.

11 And Seth was the son of Shiblon.

12 And Shiblon was the son of Com.

13 And Com was the son of Coriantum.

14 And Coriantum was the son of
Amnigaddah.

15 And Amnigaddah was the son
of Aaron.

16 And Aaron was a descendant of
Heth, who was the son of Hearthom.

17 And Hearthom was the son of
Lib.

18 And Lib was the son of Kish.

19 And Kish was the son of Corom.

20 And Corom was the son of Levi.

21 And Levi was the son of Kim.

22 And Kim was the son of
Morianton.

23 And Morianton was a descendant of Riplakish.

24 And Riplakish was the son of
Shez.

25 And Shez was the son of Heth.

26 And Heth was the son of Com.

27 And Com was the son of Coriantum.

28 And Coriantum was the son
of Emer.

29 And Emer was the son of Omer.

30 And Omer was the son of Shule.

31 And Shule was the son of Kib.

32 And Kib was the son of Orihah, who was the son of Jared;

33 Which Jared came forth with
his brother and their families, with
some others and their families, from
the great tower, at the time the Lord
confounded the language of the
people, and swore in his wrath that
they should be scattered upon all
the face of the earth; and according
to the word of the Lord the people
were scattered.

34 And the brother of Jared being a large and mighty man, and
a man highly favored of the Lord,
Jared, his brother, said unto him:
Cry unto the Lord, that he will not
confound us that we may not understand our words.

35 And it came to pass that the
brother of Jared did cry unto the
Lord, and the Lord had compassion
upon Jared; therefore he did not
confound the language of Jared;
and Jared and his brother were not
confounded.

36 Then Jared said unto his
brother: Cry again unto the Lord,
and it may be that he will turn away
his anger from them who are our
friends, that he confound not their
language.

37 And it came to pass that the
brother of Jared did cry unto the
Lord, and the Lord had compassion
