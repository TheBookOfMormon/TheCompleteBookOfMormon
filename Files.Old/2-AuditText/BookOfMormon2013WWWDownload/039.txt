5 Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded
me to make these plates
for a wise purpose in him, which
purpose I know not.

6 But the Lord knoweth all things
from the beginning; wherefore, he
prepareth a way to accomplish all
his works among the children of
men; for behold, he hath all power
unto the fulfilling of all his words.
And thus it is. Amen.

CHAPTER 10

Lehi predicts that the Jews will be taken
captive by the Babylonians—He tells of
the coming among the Jews of a Messiah,
a Savior, a Redeemer—Lehi tells
also of the coming of the one who should
baptize the Lamb of God—Lehi tells of
the death and resurrection of the Messiah—
He compares the scattering and
gathering of Israel to an olive tree—
Nephi speaks of the Son of God, of the
gift of the Holy Ghost, and of the need
for righteousness. About 600-592 B.C.

And now I, Nephi, proceed to give
an account upon these plates of
my proceedings, and my reign and
ministry; wherefore, to proceed with
mine account, I must speak somewhat

even that great city Jerusalem,
and many be carried away
captive into Babylon, according to
the own due time of the Lord, they
should return again, yea, even be

after they should be brought back
out of captivity they should possess
again the land of their inheritance.

4 Yea, even six hundred years
from the time that my father left
Jerusalem, a prophet would the
Lord God raise up among the Jews—
even a Messiah, or, in other words,
a Savior of the world.

5 And he also spake concerning the
prophets, how great a number had
testified of these things, concerning
this Messiah, of whom he had spoken,
or this Redeemer of the world.

6 Wherefore, all mankind were in a
lost and in a fallen state, and ever
would be save they should rely on
this Redeemer.

7 And he spake also concerning a
prophet who should come before
the Messiah, to prepare the way of
the Lord—

8 Yea, even he should go forth and
cry in the wilderness: Prepare ye
the way of the Lord, and make his
paths straight; for there standeth
one among you whom ye know not;
and he is mightier than I, whose
shoe's latchet I am not worthy to
unloose. And much spake my father
concerning this thing.

9 And my father said he should
