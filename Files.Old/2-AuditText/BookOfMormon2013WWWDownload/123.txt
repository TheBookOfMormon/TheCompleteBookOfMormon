out the prophets, and the saints,
and stone them, and slay them;
wherefore the cry of the blood of
the saints shall ascend up to God
from the ground against them.

4 Wherefore, all those who are
proud, and that do wickedly, the
day that cometh shall burn them
up, saith the Lord of Hosts, for they
shall be as stubble.

5 And they that kill the prophets,
and the saints, the depths of the
earth shall swallow them up, saith
the Lord of Hosts; and mountains
shall cover them, and whirlwinds
shall carry them away, and buildings
shall fall upon them and crush
them to pieces and grind them to
powder.

6 And they shall be visited with
thunderings, and lightnings, and
earthquakes, and all manner of destructions,
for the fire of the anger
of the Lord shall be kindled against
them, and they shall be as stubble,
and the day that cometh shall consume them,
saith the Lord of Hosts.

7 O the pain, and the anguish
of my soul for the loss of the slain of
my people! For I, Nephi, have seen
it, and it well nigh consumeth me

9 But the Son of Righteousness
shall appear unto them; and he
shall heal them, and they shall have

shall have passed away, and
many of the fourth generation shall
have passed away in righteousness.

10 And when these things have
passed away a speedy destruction
cometh unto my people; for,
notwithstanding the pains of my
soul, I have seen it; wherefore, I
know that it shall come to pass; and
they sell themselves for naught; for,
for the reward of their pride and
their foolishness they shall reap
destruction; for because they yield
unto the devil and choose works of
darkness rather than light, therefore
they must go down to hell.

11 For the Spirit of the Lord will
not always strive with man. And
when the Spirit ceaseth to strive
with man then cometh speedy destruction,
and this grieveth my
soul.

12 And as I spake concerning the
convincing of the Jews, that Jesus
is the very Christ, it must needs
be that the Gentiles be convinced
also that Jesus is the Christ, the
Eternal God;
