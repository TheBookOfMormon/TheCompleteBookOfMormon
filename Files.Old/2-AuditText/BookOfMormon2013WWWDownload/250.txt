was an hungered, and he said to
a man: Will ye give to an humble
servant of God something to eat?

20 And the man said unto him: I
am a Nephite, and I know that thou
art a holy prophet of God, for thou
art the man whom an angel said in
a vision: Thou shalt receive. Therefore, go with me into my house
and I will impart unto thee of my
food; and I know that thou wilt be
a blessing unto me and my house.

21 And it came to pass that the
man received him into his house;
and the man was called Amulek;
and he brought forth bread and
meat and set before Alma.

22 And it came to pass that Alma
ate bread and was filled; and he
blessed Amulek and his house, and
he gave thanks unto God.

23 And after he had eaten and
was filled he said unto Amulek: I
am Alma, and am the high priest
over the church of God throughout
the land.

24 And behold, I have been called
to preach the word of God among all
this people, according to the spirit
of revelation and prophecy; and I
was in this land and they would
not receive me, but they cast me
out and I was about to set my back
towards this land forever.

25 But behold, I have been commanded that I should turn again and
prophesy unto this people, yea, and
to testify against them concerning
their iniquities.

26 And now, Amulek, because thou
hast fed me and taken me in, thou
art blessed; for I was an hungered,
for I had fasted many days.

27 And Alma tarried many days
with Amulek before he began to
preach unto the people.

28 And it came to pass that the
people did wax more gross in their
iniquities.

29 And the word came to Alma,
saying: Go; and also say unto my servant Amulek, go forth and prophesy
unto this people, saying—Repent
ye, for thus saith the Lord, except
ye repent I will visit this people in
mine anger; yea, and I will not turn
my fierce anger away.

30 And Alma went forth, and also
Amulek, among the people, to declare the words of God unto them;
and they were filled with the Holy
Ghost.

31 And they had power given unto
them, insomuch that they could
not be confined in dungeons; neither was it possible that any man
could slay them; nevertheless they
did not exercise their power until they were bound in bands and
cast into prison. Now, this was done
that the Lord might show forth his
power in them.

32 And it came to pass that they
went forth and began to preach
and to prophesy unto the people,
according to the spirit and power
which the Lord had given them.



The words of Alma, and also the
words of Amulek, which were declared unto the people who were
in the land of Ammonihah. And
also they are cast into prison, and
delivered by the miraculous power
of God which was in them, according to the record of Alma.
Comprising chapters 9 through 14.

CHAPTER 9

Alma commands the people of Ammonihah
to repent—The Lord will be
merciful to the Lamanites in the last
days—If the Nephites forsake the light,
they will be destroyed by the Lamanites—
The Son of God will come soon—
He will redeem those who repent, are
baptized, and have faith in His name.
