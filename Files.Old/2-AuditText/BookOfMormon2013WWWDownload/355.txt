CHAPTER 50

Moroni fortifies the lands of the Nephites—
They build many new cities—Wars
and destructions befell the Nephites in
the days of their wickedness and abominations—
Morianton and his dissenters
are defeated by Teancum—Nephihah
dies, and his son Pahoran fills the judgment seat.
About 72-67 B.C.

And now it came to pass that Moroni
did not stop making preparations for
war, or to defend his people against
the Lamanites; for he caused that
his armies should commence in the
commencement of the twentieth
year of the reign of the judges, that
they should commence in digging
up heaps of earth round about
all the cities, throughout all the
land which was possessed by the
Nephites.

2 And upon the top of these ridges
of earth he caused that there should
be timbers, yea, works of timbers
built up to the height of a man,
round about the cities.

3 And he caused that upon those
works of timbers there should be
a frame of pickets built upon the
timbers round about; and they were
strong and high.

4 And he caused towers to be
erected that overlooked those works
of pickets, and he caused places of security to be built upon those towers,
that the stones and the arrows of
the Lamanites could not hurt them.

5 And they were prepared that
they could cast stones from the top
thereof, according to their pleasure
and their strength, and slay him
who should attempt to approach
near the walls of the city.

6 Thus Moroni did prepare strongholds against the coming of their
enemies, round about every city in
all the land.

7 And it came to pass that Moroni
caused that his armies should go
forth into the east wilderness; yea,
and they went forth and drove all
the Lamanites who were in the east
wilderness into their own lands,
which were south of the land of
Zarahemla.

8 And the land of Nephi did run
in a straight course from the east
sea to the west.

9 And it came to pass that when
Moroni had driven all the Lamanites out of the east wilderness,
which was north of the lands of
their own possessions, he caused
that the inhabitants who were in
the land of Zarahemla and in the
land round about should go forth
into the east wilderness, even to the
borders by the seashore, and possess
the land.

10 And he also placed armies on
the south, in the borders of their
possessions, and caused them to
erect fortifications that they might
secure their armies and their people
from the hands of their enemies.

11 And thus he cut off all the
strongholds of the Lamanites in
the east wilderness, yea, and also
on the west, fortifying the line
between the Nephites and the Lamanites, between the land of Zarahemla and the land of Nephi, from
the west sea, running by the head
of the river Sidon—the Nephites
possessing all the land northward,
yea, even all the land which was
northward of the land Bountiful,
according to their pleasure.

12 Thus Moroni, with his armies,
which did increase daily because of
the assurance of protection which
his works did bring forth unto them,
did seek to cut off the strength and
the power of the Lamanites from off
the lands of their possessions, that
they should have no power upon
the lands of their possession.

13 And it came to pass that the
Nephites began the foundation of a
