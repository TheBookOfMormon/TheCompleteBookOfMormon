strugglings for my brethren, the
Lamanites.

12 And it came to pass that after
I had prayed and labored with all
diligence, the Lord said unto me: I
will grant unto thee according to
thy desires, because of thy faith.

13 And now behold, this was the
desire which I desired of him—that
if it should so be, that my people,
the Nephites, should fall into transgression,
and by any means be destroyed,
and the Lamanites should
not be destroyed, that the Lord
God would preserve a record of
my people, the Nephites; even if it
so be by the power of his holy arm,
that it might be brought forth at
some future day unto the Lamanites,
that, perhaps, they might be
brought unto salvation—

14 For at the present our strugglings
were vain in restoring them
to the true faith. And they swore in
their wrath that, if it were possible,
they would destroy our records
and us, and also all the traditions
of our fathers.

15 Wherefore, I knowing that the
Lord God was able to preserve our
records, I cried unto him continually,
for he had said unto me: Whatsoever
thing ye shall ask in faith,
believing that ye shall receive in the
name of Christ, ye shall receive it.

16 And I had faith, and I did cry
unto God that he would preserve
the records; and he covenanted
with me that he would bring them
forth unto the Lamanites in his own
due time.

17 And I, Enos, knew it would be
according to the covenant which
he had made; wherefore my soul
did rest.

18 And the Lord said unto me:
Thy fathers have also required of
me this thing; and it shall be done
unto them according to their faith;
for their faith was like unto thine.

19 And now it came to pass that I,
Enos, went about among the people
of Nephi, prophesying of things to
come, and testifying of the things
which I had heard and seen.

20 And I bear record that the
people of Nephi did seek diligently
to restore the Lamanites unto
the true faith in God. But our labors
were vain; their hatred was
fixed, and they were led by their
evil nature that they became wild,
and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty
people, full of idolatry and filthiness;
feeding upon beasts of prey;
dwelling in tents, and wandering
about in the wilderness with a short
skin girdle about their loins and
their heads shaven; and their skill
was in the bow, and in the cimeter,
and the ax. And many of them did
eat nothing save it was raw meat;
and they were continually seeking
to destroy us.

21 And it came to pass that the
people of Nephi did till the land,
and raise all manner of grain, and
of fruit, and flocks of herds, and
flocks of all manner of cattle of every
kind, and goats, and wild goats,
and also many horses.

22 And there were exceedingly

[p160
many prophets among us. And the
people were a stiffnecked people,
hard to understand.

23 And there was nothing save it
was exceeding harshness, preaching
and prophesying of wars, and
contentions, and destructions, and
continually reminding them of
death, and the duration of eternity,
and the judgments and the power of
God, and all these things—stirring
them up continually to keep them
in the fear of the Lord. I say there
was nothing short of these things,
and exceedingly great plainness of
speech, would keep them from going
down speedily to destruction.
And after this manner do I write
concerning them.

24 And I saw wars between the
Nephites and Lamanites in the
course of my days.

25 And it came to pass that I began
to be old, and an hundred and
seventy and nine years had passed
away from the time that our father
Lehi left Jerusalem.

26 And I saw that I must soon
go down to my grave, having been
wrought upon by the power of God
that I must preach and prophesy
unto this people, and declare the
word according to the truth which
is in Christ. And I have declared it
in all my days, and have rejoiced
in it above that of the world.

27 And I soon go to the place of my
rest, which is with my Redeemer;
for I know that in him I shall rest.
And I rejoice in the day when my
mortal shall put on immortality,
and shall stand before him; then
shall I see his face with pleasure,
and he will say unto me: Come unto
me, ye blessed, there is a place prepared
for you in the mansions of
my Father. Amen.

THE BOOK OF JAROM

The Nephites keep the law of Moses,
look forward to the coming of Christ,
and prosper in the land—Many prophets
labor to keep the people in the way
of truth. About 399-361 B.C.

Now behold, I, Jarom, write
a few words according to
the commandment of my
father, Enos, that our genealogy
may be kept.

2 And as these plates are small,
and as these things are written
for the intent of the benefit of our
brethren the Lamanites, wherefore,
it must needs be that I write a little;
but I shall not write the things of
my prophesying, nor of my revelations.
For what could I write more
than my fathers have written? For
have not they revealed the plan of
salvation? I say unto you, Yea; and
this sufficeth me.
