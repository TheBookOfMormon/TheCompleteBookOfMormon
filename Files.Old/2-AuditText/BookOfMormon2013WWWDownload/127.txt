be sealed by the power of God, and
the revelation which was sealed
shall be kept in the book until the
own due time of the Lord, that they
may come forth; for behold, they reveal
all things from the foundation
of the world unto the end thereof.

11 And the day cometh that the
words of the book which were sealed
shall be read upon the house tops;
and they shall be read by the power
of Christ; and all things shall be
revealed unto the children of men
which ever have been among the
children of men, and which ever will
be even unto the end of the earth.

12 Wherefore, at that day when
the book shall be delivered unto the
man of whom I have spoken, the
book shall be hid from the eyes of
the world, that the eyes of none shall
behold it save it be that three witnesses
shall behold it, by the power
of God, besides him to whom the
book shall be delivered; and they
shall testify to the truth of the book
and the things therein.

13 And there is none other which
shall view it, save it be a few according
to the will of God, to bear testimony
of his word unto the children
of men; for the Lord God hath said
that the words of the faithful should
speak as if it were from the dead.

14 Wherefore, the Lord God will
proceed to bring forth the words
of the book; and in the mouth of
as many witnesses as seemeth him
good will he establish his word; and
wo be unto him that rejecteth the
word of God!

15 But behold, it shall come to
pass that the Lord God shall say
unto him to whom he shall deliver
the book: Take these words which
are not sealed and deliver them to
another, that he may show them
unto the learned, saying: Read this,
I pray thee. And the learned shall
say: Bring hither the book, and I
will read them.

16 And now, because of the glory
of the world and to get gain will
they say this, and not for the glory
of God.

17 And the man shall say: I cannot
bring the book, for it is sealed.

18 Then shall the learned say: I
cannot read it.

19 Wherefore it shall come to pass,
that the Lord God will deliver again
the book and the words thereof to
him that is not learned; and the
man that is not learned shall say:
I am not learned.

20 Then shall the Lord God say
unto him: The learned shall not read
them, for they have rejected them,
and I am able to do mine own work;
wherefore thou shalt read the words
which I shall give unto thee.

21 Touch not the things which are
sealed, for I will bring them forth in
mine own due time; for I will show
unto the children of men that I am
able to do mine own work.

22 Wherefore, when thou hast read
the words which I have commanded
thee, and obtained the witnesses
which I have promised unto thee,
then shalt thou seal up the book
again, and hide it up unto me, that
I may preserve the words which
thou hast not read, until I shall see
fit in mine own wisdom to reveal
all things unto the children of men.

23 For behold, I am God; and I am
a God of miracles; and I will show
