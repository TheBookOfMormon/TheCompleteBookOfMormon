fast to the rod of iron, until they
came forth and fell down and partook
of the fruit of the tree.

31 And he also saw other multitudes
feeling their way towards
that great and spacious building.

32 And it came to pass that many
were drowned in the depths of
the fountain; and many were lost
from his view, wandering in strange
roads.

33 And great was the multitude
that did enter into that strange
building. And after they did enter
into that building they did point
the finger of scorn at me and
those that were partaking of the
fruit also; but we heeded them not.

34 These are the words of my
father: For as many as heeded
them, had fallen away.

35 And Laman and Lemuel partook
not of the fruit, said my
father.

36 And it came to pass after my
father had spoken all the words of
his dream or vision, which were
many, he said unto us, because
of these things which he saw in a
vision, he exceedingly feared for
Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared
lest they should be cast off from
the presence of the Lord.

37 And he did exhort them then
with all the feeling of a tender parent,
that they would hearken to his
words, that perhaps the Lord would
be merciful to them, and not cast
them off; yea, my father did preach
unto them.

38 And after he had preached
unto them, and also prophesied unto
them of many things, he bade them
to keep the commandments of the
Lord; and he did cease speaking
unto them.

CHAPTER 9

Nephi makes two sets of records—Each
is called the plates of Nephi—The larger
plates contain a secular history; the
smaller ones deal primarily with sacred
things. About 600-592 B.C.

And all these things did my father
see, and hear, and speak, as he dwelt
in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel,
and also a great many more things,
which cannot be written upon these
plates.

2 And now, as I have spoken concerning
these plates, behold they
are not the plates upon which I
make a full account of the history
of my people; for the plates upon
which I make a full account of my
people I have given the name of
Nephi; wherefore, they are called
the plates of Nephi, after mine own
name; and these plates also are
called the plates of Nephi.

3 Nevertheless, I have received a
commandment of the Lord that I
should make these plates, for the
special purpose that there should
be an account engraven of the ministry
of my people.

4 Upon the other plates should be
engraven an account of the reign
of the kings, and the wars and contentions
of my people; wherefore
these plates are for the more part of
the ministry; and the other plates
are for the more part of the reign
of the kings and the wars and contentions
of my people.
