Messiah—He will first come six hundred
years after Lehi left Jerusalem—The
Nephites keep the law of Moses and
believe in Christ, who is the Holy One
of Israel. About 559-545 B.C.

Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat
concerning the words which I have
written, which have been spoken
by the mouth of Isaiah. For behold,
Isaiah spake many things which
were hard for many of my people
to understand; for they know not
concerning the manner of prophesying
among the Jews.

2 For I, Nephi, have not taught
them many things concerning the
manner of the Jews; for their works
were works of darkness, and their
doings were doings of abominations.

3 Wherefore, I write unto my people,
unto all those that shall receive
hereafter these things which I write,
that they may know the judgments
of God, that they come upon all nations,
according to the word which
he hath spoken.

4 Wherefore, hearken, O my people,
which are of the house of Israel,
and give ear unto my words;
for because the words of Isaiah are
not plain unto you, nevertheless
they are plain unto all those that
are filled with the spirit of prophecy.
But I give unto you a prophecy,
according to the spirit which is in
me; wherefore I shall prophesy according
to the plainness which hath
been with me from the time that I
came out from Jerusalem with my
father; for behold, my soul delighteth
in plainness unto my people,
that they may learn.

5 Yea, and my soul delighteth in
the words of Isaiah, for I came out
from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath
beheld the things of the Jews, and
I know that the Jews do understand
the things of the prophets, and there
is none other people that understand
the things which were spoken
unto the Jews like unto them, save
it be that they are taught after the
manner of the things of the Jews.

6 But behold, I, Nephi, have not
taught my children after the manner
of the Jews; but behold, I, of
myself, have dwelt at Jerusalem,
wherefore I know concerning the
regions round about; and I have
made mention unto my children
concerning the judgments of God,
which hath come to pass among the
Jews, unto my children, according
to all that which Isaiah hath spoken,
and I do not write them.

7 But behold, I proceed with mine
own prophecy, according to my
plainness; in the which I know
that no man can err; nevertheless,
in the days that the prophecies of
Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall
know of a surety, at the times when
they shall come to pass.

8 Wherefore, they are of worth
unto the children of men, and he
that supposeth that they are not,
unto them will I speak particularly,
and confine the words unto mine
own people; for I know that they
shall be of great worth unto them in
the last days; for in that day shall
they understand them; wherefore,
for their good have I written them.

been destroyed among the Jews because
of iniquity, even so have they
been destroyed from generation to
