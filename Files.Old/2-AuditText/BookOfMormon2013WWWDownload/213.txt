began to build buildings; yea, they
were industrious, and did labor
exceedingly.

6 And the people were desirous
that Alma should be their king,
for he was beloved by his people.

7 But he said unto them: Behold,
it is not expedient that we should
have a king; for thus saith the Lord:
Ye shall not esteem one flesh above
another, or one man shall not think
himself above another; therefore
I say unto you it is not expedient
that ye should have a king.

8 Nevertheless, if it were possible
that ye could always have just men
to be your kings it would be well
for you to have a king.

9 But remember the iniquity of
king Noah and his priests; and I
myself was caught in a snare, and
did many things which were abominable in the sight of the Lord, which
caused me sore repentance;

10 Nevertheless, after much
tribulation, the Lord did hear my
cries, and did answer my prayers,
and has made me an instrument
in his hands in bringing so many
of you to a knowledge of his truth.

11 Nevertheless, in this I do not
glory, for I am unworthy to glory
of myself.

12 And now I say unto you, ye have
been oppressed by king Noah, and
have been in bondage to him and his
priests, and have been brought into
iniquity by them; therefore ye were
bound with the bands of iniquity.

13 And now as ye have been delivered by the power of God out of these
bonds; yea, even out of the hands of
king Noah and his people, and also
from the bonds of iniquity, even so
I desire that ye should stand fast
in this liberty wherewith ye have
been made free, and that ye trust
no man to be a king over you.

14 And also trust no one to be your
teacher nor your minister, except
he be a man of God, walking in his
ways and keeping his commandments.

15 Thus did Alma teach his people, that every man should love
his neighbor as himself, that there
should be no contention among
them.

16 And now, Alma was their high
priest, he being the founder of their
church.

17 And it came to pass that none
received authority to preach or to
teach except it were by him from
God. Therefore he consecrated all
their priests and all their teachers;
and none were consecrated except
they were just men.

18 Therefore they did watch over
their people, and did nourish them
with things pertaining to righteousness.

19 And it came to pass that they
began to prosper exceedingly in
the land; and they called the land
Helam.

20 And it came to pass that they
did multiply and prosper exceedingly in the land of Helam; and they
built a city, which they called the
city of Helam.

21 Nevertheless the Lord seeth fit
