plates, which contain these prophesyings
and revelations, and put them
with the remainder of my record,
for they are choice unto me; and I
know they will be choice unto my
brethren.

7 And I do this for a wise purpose;
for thus it whispereth me, according
to the workings of the Spirit of
the Lord which is in me. And now,
I do not know all things; but the
Lord knoweth all things which are
to come; wherefore, he worketh
in me to do according to his will.

8 And my prayer to God is concerning
my brethren, that they may
once again come to the knowledge
of God, yea, the redemption of
Christ; that they may once again
be a delightsome people.

9 And now I, Mormon, proceed to
finish out my record, which I take
from the plates of Nephi; and I make
it according to the knowledge and
the understanding which God has
given me.

10 Wherefore, it came to pass that
after Amaleki had delivered up
these plates into the hands of king
Benjamin, he took them and put
them with the other plates, which
contained records which had been
handed down by the kings, from
generation to generation until the
days of king Benjamin.

11 And they were handed down

13 And it came to pass also that
the armies of the Lamanites came
down out of the land of Nephi, to
battle against his people. But behold,
king Benjamin gathered together
his armies, and he did stand
against them; and he did fight with
the strength of his own arm, with the
sword of Laban.

14 And in the strength of the Lord
they did contend against their enemies,
until they had slain many
thousands of the Lamanites. And
it came to pass that they did contend
against the Lamanites until
they had driven them out of all the
lands of their inheritance.

15 And it came to pass that after
there had been false Christs, and
their mouths had been shut, and they
punished according to their crimes;

16 And after there had been false

these having been punished according

having been much contention and
many dissensions away unto the
Lamanites, behold, it came to pass
that king Benjamin, with the assistance
of the holy prophets who
were among his people—

17 For behold, king Benjamin was
