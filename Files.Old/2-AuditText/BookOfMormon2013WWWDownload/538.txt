wherefore, Coriantumr did gather
his armies together upon the hill
Comnor, and did sound a trumpet
unto the armies of Shiz to invite
them forth to battle.

29 And it came to pass that they
came forth, but were driven again;
and they came the second time, and
they were driven again the second
time. And it came to pass that they
came again the third time, and the
battle became exceedingly sore.

30 And it came to pass that Shiz
smote upon Coriantumr that he
gave him many deep wounds; and
Coriantumr, having lost his blood,
fainted, and was carried away as
though he were dead.

31 Now the loss of men, women
and children on both sides was so
great that Shiz commanded his people that they should not pursue the
armies of Coriantumr; wherefore,
they returned to their camp.

CHAPTER 15

Millions of the Jaredites are slain in
battle—Shiz and Coriantumr assemble
all the people to mortal combat—The
Spirit of the Lord ceases to strive with
them—The Jaredite nation is utterly
destroyed—Only Coriantumr remains.

And it came to pass when Coriantumr had recovered of his wounds,
he began to remember the words
which Ether had spoken unto him.

2 He saw that there had been
slain by the sword already nearly
two millions of his people, and he
began to sorrow in his heart; yea,
there had been slain two millions
of mighty men, and also their wives
and their children.

3 He began to repent of the evil
which he had done; he began to
remember the words which had
been spoken by the mouth of all
the prophets, and he saw them that
they were fulfilled thus far, every
whit; and his soul mourned and
refused to be comforted.

4 And it came to pass that he wrote
an epistle unto Shiz, desiring him
that he would spare the people, and
he would give up the kingdom for
the sake of the lives of the people.

5 And it came to pass that when
Shiz had received his epistle he
wrote an epistle unto Coriantumr,
that if he would give himself up,
that he might slay him with his own
sword, that he would spare the lives
of the people.

6 And it came to pass that the
people repented not of their iniquity; and the people of Coriantumr
were stirred up to anger against the
people of Shiz; and the people of
Shiz were stirred up to anger against
the people of Coriantumr; wherefore, the people of Shiz did give battle unto the people of Coriantumr.

7 And when Coriantumr saw that
he was about to fall he fled again
before the people of Shiz.

8 And it came to pass that he came
to the waters of Ripliancum, which,
by interpretation, is large, or to
exceed all; wherefore, when they
came to these waters they pitched
their tents; and Shiz also pitched
his tents near unto them; and therefore on the morrow they did come
to battle.

9 And it came to pass that they
fought an exceedingly sore battle,
in which Coriantumr was wounded
again, and he fainted with the loss
of blood.

10 And it came to pass that the
armies of Coriantumr did press
upon the armies of Shiz that they
beat them, that they caused them
to flee before them; and they did
flee southward, and did pitch their
tents in a place which was called
Ogath.

11 And it came to pass that the
army of Coriantumr did pitch their
tents by the hill Ramah; and it was
that same hill where my father
Mormon did hide up the records
unto the Lord, which were sacred.
