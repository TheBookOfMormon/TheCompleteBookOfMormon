were engraven on the plates of
brass; and also the plates of Nephi;
and also, the sword of Laban, and
the ball or director, which led our
fathers through the wilderness,
which was prepared by the hand of
the Lord that thereby they might
be led, every one according to the
heed and diligence which they gave
unto him.

17 Therefore, as they were unfaithful
they did not prosper nor progress
in their journey, but were driven
back, and incurred the displeasure
of God upon them; and therefore
they were smitten with famine and
sore afflictions, to stir them up in
remembrance of their duty.

18 And now, it came to pass that
Mosiah went and did as his father
had commanded him, and proclaimed
unto all the people who
were in the land of Zarahemla that
thereby they might gather themselves
together, to go up to the
temple to hear the words which
his father should speak unto them.

CHAPTER 2

King Benjamin addresses his people—He
recounts the equity, fairness, and spirituality
of his reign—He counsels them to
serve their Heavenly King—Those who
rebel against God will suffer anguish
like unquenchable fire. About 124 B.C.

had done as his father had
commanded him, and had made

4 And also that they might give
thanks to the Lord their God, who
had brought them out of the land
of Jerusalem, and who had delivered
them out of the hands of their
enemies, and had appointed just
men to be their teachers, and also
a just man to be their king, who
had established peace in the land
of Zarahemla, and who had taught
them to keep the commandments
of God, that they might rejoice and
be filled with love towards God
and all men.

5 And it came to pass that when
they came up to the temple, they
pitched their tents round about,
every man according to his family,
consisting of his wife, and his
sons, and his daughters, and their
sons, and their daughters, from
the eldest down to the youngest,
every family being separate one
from another.

6 And they pitched their tents
round about the temple, every man
having his tent with the door thereof

they might remain in their tents
and hear the words which king
Benjamin should speak unto them;
