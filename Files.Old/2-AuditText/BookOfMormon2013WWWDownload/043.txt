which waters are a representation
of the love of God; and I also beheld
that the tree of life was a representation
of the love of God.

26 And the angel said unto me
again: Look and behold the condescension
of God!

27 And I looked and beheld the
Redeemer of the world, of whom
my father had spoken; and I also
beheld the prophet who should
prepare the way before him. And
the Lamb of God went forth and
was baptized of him; and after
he was baptized, I beheld the heavens
open, and the Holy Ghost come
down out of heaven and abide upon
him in the form of a dove.

28 And I beheld that he went
forth ministering unto the people,
in power and great glory; and the
multitudes were gathered together
to hear him; and I beheld that they
cast him out from among them.

29 And I also beheld twelve others
following him. And it came to
pass that they were carried away
in the Spirit from before my face,
and I saw them not.

30 And it came to pass that the
angel spake unto me again, saying:
Look! And I looked, and I beheld
the heavens open again, and I saw
angels descending upon the children
of men; and they did minister
unto them.

31 And he spake unto me again,
saying: Look! And I looked, and I
beheld the Lamb of God going forth
among the children of men. And I
beheld multitudes of people who
were sick, and who were afflicted

angel spake unto me again, saying:
Look! And I looked and beheld the
Lamb of God, that he was taken
by the people; yea, the Son of the
everlasting God was judged of the
world; and I saw and bear record.

33 And I, Nephi, saw that he was
lifted up upon the cross and slain
for the sins of the world.

34 And after he was slain I saw the
multitudes of the earth, that they
were gathered together to fight
against the apostles of the Lamb;
for thus were the twelve called by
the angel of the Lord.

35 And the multitude of the earth
was gathered together; and I beheld
that they were in a large and
spacious building, like unto the
building which my father saw. And
the angel of the Lord spake unto
me again, saying: Behold the world
and the wisdom thereof; yea, behold
the house of Israel hath gathered
together to fight against the twelve
apostles of the Lamb.

36 And it came to pass that I saw
and bear record, that the great and
spacious building was the pride of
the world; and it fell, and the fall
thereof was exceedingly great. And
the angel of the Lord spake unto me
