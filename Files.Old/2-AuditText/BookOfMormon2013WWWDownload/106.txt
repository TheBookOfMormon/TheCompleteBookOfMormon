comely to them that are escaped
of Israel.

3 And it shall come to pass, they
that are left in Zion and remain in
Jerusalem shall be called holy, every
one that is written among the
living in Jerusalem—

4 When the Lord shall have washed
away the filth of the daughters of
Zion, and shall have purged the
blood of Jerusalem from the midst
thereof by the spirit of judgment
and by the spirit of burning.

5 And the Lord will create upon
every dwelling-place of mount Zion,
and upon her assemblies, a cloud
and smoke by day and the shining of
a flaming fire by night; for upon all
the glory of Zion shall be a defence.

6 And there shall be a tabernacle
for a shadow in the daytime from the
heat, and for a place of refuge, and
a covert from storm and from rain.

CHAPTER 15

The Lord's vineyard (Israel) will become
desolate, and His people will
be scattered—Woes will come upon
them in their apostate and scattered
state—The Lord will lift an ensign
and gather Israel—Compare Isaiah 5.
About 559-545 B.C.

And then will I sing to my well-beloved
a song of my beloved, touching
his vineyard. My well-beloved
hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.

2 And he fenced it, and gathered
out the stones thereof, and planted
it with the choicest vine, and built
a tower in the midst of it, and also
made a wine-press therein; and he
looked that it should bring forth
grapes, and it brought forth wild

I pray you, betwixt me and my
vineyard.

4 What could have been done
more to my vineyard that I have
not done in it? Wherefore, when
I looked that it should bring forth
grapes it brought forth wild grapes.

5 And now go to; I will tell you
what I will do to my vineyard—I
will take away the hedge thereof,
and it shall be eaten up; and I will
break down the wall thereof, and
it shall be trodden down;

6 And I will lay it waste; it shall
not be pruned nor digged; but there

will also command the clouds that
they rain no rain upon it.

7 For the vineyard of the Lord of
Hosts is the house of Israel, and the
men of Judah his pleasant plant;
and he looked for judgment, and
behold, oppression; for righteousness,
but behold, a cry.

8 Wo unto them that join house
to house, till there can be no place,
that they may be placed alone in
the midst of the earth!

9 In mine ears, said the Lord of
Hosts, of a truth many houses shall
be desolate, and great and fair cities
without inhabitant.

10 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall
yield one bath, and the seed of a
homer shall yield an ephah.

11 Wo unto them that rise up
early in the morning, that they may
follow strong drink, that continue
until night, and wine inflame
them!

12 And the harp, and the viol, the
tabret, and pipe, and wine are in
their feasts; but they regard not
