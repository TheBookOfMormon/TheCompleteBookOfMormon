Now it came to pass that the
ninety and first year had
passed away and it was six
hundred years from the time that
Lehi left Jerusalem; and it was in
the year that Lachoneus was the
chief judge and the governor over
the land.

2 And Nephi, the son of Helaman, had departed out of the land
of Zarahemla, giving charge unto
his son Nephi, who was his eldest
son, concerning the plates of brass,
and all the records which had been
kept, and all those things which
had been kept sacred from the departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem.

3 Then he departed out of the
land, and whither he went, no man
knoweth; and his son Nephi did
keep the records in his stead, yea,
the record of this people.

4 And it came to pass that in the
commencement of the ninety and
second year, behold, the prophecies
of the prophets began to be fulfilled
more fully; for there began to be
greater signs and greater miracles
wrought among the people.

5 But there were some who began
to say that the time was past for the
words to be fulfilled, which were
spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite.

6 And they began to rejoice over
their brethren, saying: Behold the
time is past, and the words of Samuel
are not fulfilled; therefore, your
joy and your faith concerning this

7 And it came to pass that they did
make a great uproar throughout the
land; and the people who believed
began to be very sorrowful, lest
by any means those things which
had been spoken might not come

8 But behold, they did watch steadfastly for that day and that night
and that day which should be as
one day as if there were no night,
that they might know that their
faith had not been vain.

9 Now it came to pass that there
was a day set apart by the unbelievers, that all those who believed
in those traditions should be put to
death except the sign should come
to pass, which had been given by
Samuel the prophet.

10 Now it came to pass that when
Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw this
wickedness of his people, his heart
was exceedingly sorrowful.

11 And it came to pass that he
went out and bowed himself down
upon the earth, and cried mightily
to his God in behalf of his people,
yea, those who were about to be
destroyed because of their faith in
the tradition of their fathers.

12 And it came to pass that he
cried mightily unto the Lord all
that day; and behold, the voice of
the Lord came unto him, saying:

13 Lift up your head and be of
good cheer; for behold, the time is
at hand, and on this night shall the
sign be given, and on the morrow
come I into the world, to show unto
the world that I will fulfil all that
which I have caused to be spoken
by the mouth of my holy prophets.

14 Behold, I come unto my own,
to fulfil all things which I have
made known unto the children of
men from the foundation of the
