is good, even like as it was in the
beginning. And blessed art thou;
for because ye have been diligent in
laboring with me in my vineyard,
and have kept my commandments,
and have brought unto me again
the natural fruit, that my vineyard
is no more corrupted, and the bad
is cast away, behold ye shall have
joy with me because of the fruit
of my vineyard.

76 For behold, for a long time will
I lay up of the fruit of my vineyard
unto mine own self against the season,
which speedily cometh; and for
the last time have I nourished my
vineyard, and pruned it, and dug
about it, and dunged it; wherefore
I will lay up unto mine own self of
the fruit, for a long time, according
to that which I have spoken.

77 And when the time cometh that
evil fruit shall again come into my
vineyard, then will I cause the good
and the bad to be gathered; and the
good will I preserve unto myself, and
the bad will I cast away into its own
place. And then cometh the season
and the end; and my vineyard will
I cause to be burned with fire.

CHAPTER 6

The Lord will recover Israel in the last
days—The world will be burned with
fire—Men must follow Christ to avoid
the lake of fire and brimstone.
About 544-421 B.C.

And now, behold, my brethren, as I

that the things which this prophet
Zenos spake, concerning the house
of Israel, in the which he likened

recover his people, is the day, yea,
even the last time, that the servants
of the Lord shall go forth in
his power, to nourish and prune
his vineyard; and after that the
end soon cometh.

3 And how blessed are they who
have labored diligently in his vineyard;
and how cursed are they who
shall be cast out into their own
place! And the world shall be
burned with fire.

4 And how merciful is our God
unto us, for he remembereth the
house of Israel, both roots and
branches; and he stretches forth his
hands unto them all the day long;
and they are a stiffnecked and a
gainsaying people; but as many as
will not harden their hearts shall
be saved in the kingdom of God.

5 Wherefore, my beloved brethren,
I beseech of you in words of
soberness that ye would repent, and
come with full purpose of heart,
and cleave unto God as he cleaveth
unto you. And while his arm of
mercy is extended towards you in
