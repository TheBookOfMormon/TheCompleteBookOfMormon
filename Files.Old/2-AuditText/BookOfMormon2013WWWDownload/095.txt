corruption could not put on incorruption.
Wherefore, the first judgment
which came upon man must
needs have remained to an endless
duration. And if so, this flesh must
have laid down to rot and to crumble
to its mother earth, to rise no more.

8 O the wisdom of God, his mercy
and grace! For behold, if the flesh
should rise no more our spirits must
become subject to that angel who
fell from before the presence of
the Eternal God, and became the
devil, to rise no more.

9 And our spirits must have
become like unto him, and we become
devils, angels to a devil, to
be shut out from the presence of
our God, and to remain with the
father of lies, in misery, like unto
himself; yea, to that being who
beguiled our first parents, who
transformeth himself nigh unto an
angel of light, and stirreth up the
children of men unto secret combinations
of murder and all manner

deliver up its captive bodies, and
the bodies and the spirits of men
will be restored one to the other;
and it is by the power of the resurrection
of the Holy One of Israel.

13 O how great the plan of our God!
For on the other hand, the paradise
of God must deliver up the spirits of
the righteous, and the grave deliver
up the body of the righteous; and
the spirit and the body is restored
to itself again, and all men become
incorruptible, and immortal, and
they are living souls, having a perfect
knowledge like unto us in the
flesh, save it be that our knowledge
shall be perfect.

14 Wherefore, we shall have a perfect
knowledge of all our guilt,
and our uncleanness, and our nakedness;
and the righteous shall
