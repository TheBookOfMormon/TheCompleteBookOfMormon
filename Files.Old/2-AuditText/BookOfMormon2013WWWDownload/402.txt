even as the faces of angels. And
he beheld that they did lift their
eyes to heaven; and they were in
the attitude as if talking or lifting
their voices to some being whom
they beheld.

37 And it came to pass that this
man did cry unto the multitude,
that they might turn and look. And
behold, there was power given unto
them that they did turn and look;
and they did behold the faces of
Nephi and Lehi.

38 And they said unto the man:
Behold, what do all these things
mean, and who is it with whom
these men do converse?

39 Now the man's name was
Aminadab. And Aminadab said
unto them: They do converse with
the angels of God.

40 And it came to pass that the Lamanites said unto him: What shall
we do, that this cloud of darkness
may be removed from overshadowing us?

41 And Aminadab said unto them:
You must repent, and cry unto the
voice, even until ye shall have faith
in Christ, who was taught unto you
by Alma, and Amulek, and Zeezrom; and when ye shall do this, the
cloud of darkness shall be removed
from overshadowing you.

42 And it came to pass that they
all did begin to cry unto the voice
of him who had shaken the earth;
yea, they did cry even until the
cloud of darkness was dispersed.

43 And it came to pass that when
they cast their eyes about, and saw
that the cloud of darkness was dispersed from overshadowing them,
behold, they saw that they were
encircled about, yea every soul,
by a pillar of fire.

44 And Nephi and Lehi were in
the midst of them; yea, they were
encircled about; yea, they were as
if in the midst of a flaming fire, yet
it did harm them not, neither did
it take hold upon the walls of the
prison; and they were filled with
that joy which is unspeakable and
full of glory.

45 And behold, the Holy Spirit of
God did come down from heaven,
and did enter into their hearts, and
they were filled as if with fire,
and they could speak forth marvelous words.

46 And it came to pass that there
came a voice unto them, yea, a
pleasant voice, as if it were a whisper, saying:

47 Peace, peace be unto you, because of your faith in my Well Beloved, who was from the foundation
of the world.

48 And now, when they heard this
they cast up their eyes as if to behold from whence the voice came;
and behold, they saw the heavens
open; and angels came down out
of heaven and ministered unto
them.

49 And there were about three
hundred souls who saw and heard
these things; and they were bidden
to go forth and marvel not, neither
should they doubt.

50 And it came to pass that they
did go forth, and did minister unto
the people, declaring throughout
all the regions round about all the
things which they had heard and
seen, insomuch that the more part
of the Lamanites were convinced
of them, because of the greatness of the evidences which they
had received.

51 And as many as were convinced
did lay down their weapons of
war, and also their hatred and the
tradition of their fathers.

52 And it came to pass that they
did yield up unto the Nephites the
lands of their possession.
