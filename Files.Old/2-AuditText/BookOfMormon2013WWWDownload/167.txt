a holy man, and he did reign over
his people in righteousness; and
there were many holy men in the
land, and they did speak the word of
God with power and with authority;
and they did use much sharpness
because of the stiffneckedness of
the people—

18 Wherefore, with the help of
these, king Benjamin, by laboring
with all the might of his body and
the faculty of his whole soul, and
also the prophets, did once more
establish peace in the land.

THE BOOK OF MOSIAH

CHAPTER 1

King Benjamin teaches his sons the language
and prophecies of their fathers—
Their religion and civilization have been
preserved because of the records kept on
the various plates—Mosiah is chosen as
king and is given custody of the records
and other things. About 130-124 B.C.

And now there was no more
contention in all the land of
Zarahemla, among all the
people who belonged to king Benjamin,
so that king Benjamin had
continual peace all the remainder of
his days.

2 And it came to pass that he had
three sons; and he called their
names Mosiah, and Helorum, and
Helaman. And he caused that they
should be taught in all the language
of his fathers, that thereby
they might become men of understanding;
and that they might know
concerning the prophecies which
had been spoken by the mouths of
their fathers, which were delivered

3 And he also taught them concerning
the records which were
engraven on the plates of brass, saying:
My sons, I would that ye should
remember that were it not for these
plates, which contain these records
and these commandments, we must
have suffered in ignorance, even at
this present time, not knowing the
mysteries of God.

4 For it were not possible that our
father, Lehi, could have remembered
all these things, to have taught them
to his children, except it were for the
help of these plates; for he having
been taught in the language of the
Egyptians therefore he could read
these engravings, and teach them to
his children, that thereby they could
teach them to their children, and
so fulfilling the commandments of
God, even down to this present time.

5 I say unto you, my sons, were
it not for these things, which have
been kept and preserved by the
hand of God, that we might read and
understand of his mysteries, and
have his commandments always
