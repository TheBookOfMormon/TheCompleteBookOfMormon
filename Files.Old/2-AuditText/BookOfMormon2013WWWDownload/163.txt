spake unto our fathers, saying that:
Inasmuch as ye will not keep my
commandments ye shall not prosper
in the land.

7 Wherefore, the Lord did visit
them in great judgment; nevertheless,
he did spare the righteous
that they should not perish, but
did deliver them out of the hands
of their enemies.

8 And it came to pass that I did
deliver the plates unto my brother
Chemish.

9 Now I, Chemish, write what few
things I write, in the same book with
my brother; for behold, I saw the
last which he wrote, that he wrote it
with his own hand; and he wrote
it in the day that he delivered them
unto me. And after this manner we
keep the records, for it is according
to the commandments of our
fathers. And I make an end.

10 Behold, I, Abinadom, am the
son of Chemish. Behold, it came
to pass that I saw much war and
contention between my people, the
Nephites, and the Lamanites; and I,
with my own sword, have taken the
lives of many of the Lamanites in
the defence of my brethren.

11 And behold, the record of this
people is engraven upon plates
which is had by the kings, according
to the generations; and I know
of no revelation save that which
has been written, neither prophecy;
wherefore, that which is sufficient
is written. And I make an end.

12 Behold, I am Amaleki, the son of
Abinadom. Behold, I will speak unto
you somewhat concerning Mosiah,
who was made king over the land
of Zarahemla; for behold, he being
warned of the Lord that he should
flee out of the land of Nephi, and
as many as would hearken unto the
voice of the Lord should also depart
out of the land with him, into
the wildernessâ€”

13 And it came to pass that he did
according as the Lord had commanded
him. And they departed
out of the land into the wilderness,
as many as would hearken unto the
voice of the Lord; and they were led
by many preachings and prophesyings.
And they were admonished
continually by the word of God; and
they were led by the power of his
arm, through the wilderness until
they came down into the land which
is called the land of Zarahemla.

14 And they discovered a people,
who were called the people of
Zarahemla. Now, there was great
rejoicing among the people of Zarahemla;
and also Zarahemla did rejoice
exceedingly, because the Lord
had sent the people of Mosiah with
the plates of brass which contained
the record of the Jews.

15 Behold, it came to pass that
Mosiah discovered that the people
of Zarahemla came out from Jerusalem
at the time that Zedekiah,
king of Judah, was carried away
captive into Babylon.

16 And they journeyed in the wilderness,
and were brought by the
hand of the Lord across the great
waters, into the land where Mosiah
discovered them; and they had dwelt
there from that time forth.

17 And at the time that Mosiah
discovered them, they had become
exceedingly numerous. Nevertheless,
they had had many wars and
serious contentions, and had fallen
by the sword from time to time; and
