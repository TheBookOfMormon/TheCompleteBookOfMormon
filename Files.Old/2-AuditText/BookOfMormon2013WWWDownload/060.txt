believe that I was instructed of
the Lord.

19 And now it came to pass that I,
Nephi, was exceedingly sorrowful
because of the hardness of their
hearts; and now when they saw that
I began to be sorrowful they were
glad in their hearts, insomuch that
they did rejoice over me, saying:
We knew that ye could not construct
a ship, for we knew that ye
were lacking in judgment; wherefore,
thou canst not accomplish so
great a work.

20 And thou art like unto our
father, led away by the foolish
imaginations of his heart; yea,
he hath led us out of the land of
Jerusalem, and we have wandered
in the wilderness for these many
years; and our women have toiled,
being big with child; and they have
borne children in the wilderness
and suffered all things, save it
were death; and it would have been
better that they had died before
they came out of Jerusalem than
to have suffered these afflictions.

21 Behold, these many years we
have suffered in the wilderness,
which time we might have enjoyed
our possessions and the land of our
inheritance; yea, and we might have
been happy.

22 And we know that the people
who were in the land of Jerusalem
were a righteous people; for they

ye believe that our fathers, who were
the children of Israel, would have
been led away out of the hands of
the Egyptians if they had not hearkened
unto the words of the Lord?

24 Yea, do ye suppose that they
would have been led out of bondage,
if the Lord had not commanded
Moses that he should lead them
out of bondage?

25 Now ye know that the children
of Israel were in bondage; and
ye know that they were laden with
tasks, which were grievous to be
borne; wherefore, ye know that it
must needs be a good thing for
them, that they should be brought
out of bondage.

26 Now ye know that Moses was
commanded of the Lord to do that
great work; and ye know that by
his word the waters of the Red Sea
were divided hither and thither, and
they passed through on dry ground.

27 But ye know that the Egyptians
were drowned in the Red Sea, who
were the armies of Pharaoh.

28 And ye also know that they were
fed with manna in the wilderness.

29 Yea, and ye also know that
Moses, by his word according to the
power of God which was in him,
smote the rock, and there came
