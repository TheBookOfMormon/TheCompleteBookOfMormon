were his family, and provisions,
and tents, and departed into the
wilderness.

5 And he came down by the borders
near the shore of the Red Sea;
and he traveled in the wilderness
in the borders which are nearer the
Red Sea; and he did travel in the
wilderness with his family, which
consisted of my mother, Sariah,
and my elder brothers, who were
Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.

6 And it came to pass that when he
had traveled three days in the wilderness,
he pitched his tent in a valley
by the side of a river of water.

7 And it came to pass that he built
an altar of stones, and made an
offering unto the Lord, and gave
thanks unto the Lord our God.

8 And it came to pass that he called
the name of the river, Laman, and
it emptied into the Red Sea; and
the valley was in the borders near
the mouth thereof.

9 And when my father saw that
the waters of the river emptied
into the fountain of the Red Sea,
he spake unto Laman, saying: O
that thou mightest be like unto this
river, continually running into the
fountain of all righteousness!

10 And he also spake unto Lemuel:
O that thou mightest be like
unto this valley, firm and steadfast,
and immovable in keeping the
commandments of the Lord!

11 Now this he spake because of
the stiffneckedness of Laman and
Lemuel; for behold they did murmur
in many things against their
father, because he was a visionary
man, and had led them out of the
land of Jerusalem, to leave the land
of their inheritance, and their gold,
and their silver, and their precious
things, to perish in the wilderness.
And this they said he had done because
of the foolish imaginations
of his heart.

12 And thus Laman and Lemuel,
being the eldest, did murmur against
their father. And they did murmur
because they knew not the dealings
of that God who had created
them.

13 Neither did they believe that
Jerusalem, that great city, could be
destroyed according to the words
of the prophets. And they were like
unto the Jews who were at Jerusalem,
who sought to take away the
life of my father.

14 And it came to pass that my
father did speak unto them in the
valley of Lemuel, with power,
being filled with the Spirit, until
their frames did shake before him.
And he did confound them, that
they durst not utter against him;
wherefore, they did as he commanded
them.

15 And my father dwelt in a tent.

16 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, being exceedingly young,
nevertheless being large in stature,
and also having great desires
to know of the mysteries of God,
