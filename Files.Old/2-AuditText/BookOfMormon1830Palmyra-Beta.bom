of

of
Zedekiah

king
of

(

that'

,
[File:010]
Wherefore
it
came
to
pass
,
that
my
father
Lehi
,
as
he
went
forth
;
prayed
unto
the
Lord
,
yea
,
cven
with
all
his
heart
,
in
behalf
of
his
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
,
as
he
prayed
unto
the
Lord
,
there
cane
a
pillar
of
fire
and
dwelt
upon
a
rock
before
him
;
and
he
saw
and
heard
much
;
and
because
of
the
things
which
he
saw
and
heard
,
he
did
quake
and
tremble
exceedingly
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
returned
to
his
own
house
at
Jerusalem
;
and
he
cast
himself
upon
his
bed
,
being
overcome
with
the
spirit
and
the
things
which
he
lad
seen
;
and
being
thus
oyercome
with
the
spirit
,
he
was
carried
away
in
a
visjon
,
even
that
he
saw
the
Heavens
open
;
and
he
thought
he
saw
God
sitting
upon
his
throue
,
surrounded
with
numberless
concourses
of
angels
in
the
attitude
of
singing
and
praising
their
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
saw
one
descending
out
of
the
_aiidst
of
Heaven
,
and
he
beheld
that
his
lustre
was
above
that
of
the
sun
at
noon
-
day
;
and
he
also
saw
twelve
others
followihg
him
,
and
their
brightness
did
execed
that
of
the
stars
in
the
firmament
;
and
they
came
down
dha
went
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
;
and
the
first
came
and
stood
before
my
fa~
,
and
gaye
unto
-
him
a
Book
,
and
bade
him
that
he
should
read
,
a
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
he
read
,
he
was
filled
with
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
,
and
he
read
,
saying
,
Wo
,
wo
unto
JerusaJom
!
for
I
have
seen
thine
abominations
;
yea
,
and
many
things
didmy
father
read
concerning
Jerusalem
—
that
iL
should
.
be
destroyed
,
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
,
many
should
perish
by
the
sword
,
angignauy
sfould
be
carried
away
captive
into
Babylon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
had
read
and
saw
many
great
and
marvellous
things
,
he
did
exclaim
many
things
unto
the
Lord
;
such
as
,
Great
and
marvellous
are
thy
works
,
O
Lord
God
Almighty
!
Thy
throne
is
high
in
the
Heavens
,
and
thy
power
,
and
goodness
,
and
mercy
is
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
;
and
because
thou
art
merciful
,
thou
wilt
not
suffer
those
who
come
unto
thee
that
they
shall
perish
!
And
after
this
manner
wa
the
language
of
my
father
in
the
praising
of
his
God
;
forthis
soul
did
rejoice
,
and
his
whole
heart
was
filled
,
because
of
the
things
which
he
had
seen
;
yea
,
which
the
Lord
had
shewn
unto
him
.
And
now
I
,
Nephi
,
do
not
make
a
full
account
of
the
things
which
my
father
hath
written
,
for
he
hath
written
many
things
which
he
saw
in
vis
-.
[File:011]
jens
and
in
dreams
;
and
he
also
hath
written
many
things
which
he
prophesied
and
spake
unto
his
children
,
of
which
I
shall
not
make
a
full
account
;
but
1
shall
make
an
-
account
of
my
proceedings
in
my
days

Bchold
T
make
an
abridgment
.
of
ihe
record
of
ny
father
,
upon
plates
which
I
have
made
with
mine
own
hands
;
wherefore
,
after
that
I
have
abridged
the
vecord
of
my
father
,
then
will
Tmeke
an
account
of
mine
own
lifes
Therefore
,
1
would
that
ye
should
know
thatafter
the
Lord
had
sheyen
so
many
marvellous
things
unto
my
father
Lehi
,
yea
,
concerning
the
destruction
of
Jerusalem
,
behold
he
went
forth
among
the
people
,
and
began
to
prophesy
and
to
declare
unto
them
concerning
the
things
which
he
had
both
seen
and
heard
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Jews
did
mock
him
because
of
the
things
which
he
testified
of
them
;
for
he
truly
testified
of
their
wickedness
their
abominations
;
and
he
testified
that
the
things
which
he
saw
and
heard
,
and
also
the
things
which
he
read
in
the
Book
,
manifested
plainly
of
the
coming
of
a
Messiah
,
and
also
the
redemption
of
the
world
,
&
And
when
the
Jews
heard
these
things
,
they
were
stat
ie
with
him
;
yea
,
even
as
with
the
prophets
of
old
,
whom
the
:
cast
out
and
stoned
and
slain
;
and
they
also
sought
lus
Iie
,
”
that
they
might
takeit
away
.
But
behold
,
1
,
Nephi
,
will
shew
unto
you
that
the
tender
mercies
of
the
Lord
is
over
all
them
whom
he
hath
chosen
,
because
of
their
faith
,
to
make
them
mighty
even
unto
the
power
of
deliverance
.
i
For
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
spake
unto
my
father
,
yea
,
even
in
a
dream
,
and
sayeth
unto
him
,
Blessed
art
thou
Lehi
,
because
of
the
things
which
thou
hast
done
;
and
because
thou
hast
been
faithful
and
declared
unto
.
this
people
the
things
which
I
commanded
thee
,
behold
they
seek
to
take
away
thy
life
.
And
it'came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
commanded
my
father
,
even
in
a
dream
,
that
he
should
take
his
family
and
depart
into
the
wilderness
.
And
it
-
came
to
pass
that
he
was
obedient
.
unio
the
word
of
the
Lord
,
wherefore
he
did
as
the
Lord
commanded
him
.
Saha
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
departed
into
the
wilderness
.
And
he
left
his
house
,
and
the
land
of
his
inheritance
,
and
his
gold
,
and
his
silver
,
and
his
precious
things
,
and
toolr
nothing
~
with
him
save
it
were

family
,
and
provisions
,
and
tents
,
atid
he
departed
into
the
wilderness
;
and
he
came
down
by
the~
[File:012]
borders
near
.
the
shore
of
the
Red
Seca
3
and
he
travelled
i
the
wildemess
,
in
the
borders
,
which
was
nearer
the
Red
Sea
;
and
he
did
travel
in
the
wilderness
with
his
famil
ly
;
which
consisted
of
my
mother
,
Sariah
,
and
my
elder
brothers
,
which
were
Laman
,
Lemuel
and
Sam
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
travelled
three
days
in
the
wilderness
,
he
pitched
his
tent
in
a
valley
besidea
river
of
water
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
built
an
altar
of
stones
,
and
he
made
an
offering
unto
the
Lord
,
and
gave
thanks
unto
the
Lord
our
God
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
called
the
name
of
the
river
Laman
,
and
it
empticd
into
the
Red
Sea
;
and
the
valley
was
in
the
borders
neat
the
mouth
thereof
,
And
when
my
father
saw
that
the
waters
of
the
river
emptied
into
the
forntain
of
the
Red
Sea
,
he
spake
unto
Laman
,
saying
:
O
that
thou
mightest
be
like
unto
this
river
,
continually
running
into
the
fountain
of
all
righteousness
.
And
he
also
spake
unto
Lemuel
:
O
that
thou
mightest
be
like
unto
this
yalley
,
firm
,
and
steadfast
,
and
immoyeable
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
.
Now
this
he
spake
because
of
the
stifineckedness
of
Laman
and
Lemuel
;
for
behold
,
they
did
urmur
inmany
things
against
their
father
,
because
that
he
sa
visionary
man
,
and
that
he
had
led
them
out
of
the
land
Yerusalem
,
to
leave
the
land
of
their
inheritance
,
and
their
gold
,
and
their
silver
,
and
their
precious
things
,
and
to
perish
in
the
wilderness
,
And
this
they
said
he
had
done
beeause
of
the
foolish
imaginations
of
his
heart
.
And
thus
Laman
and
Lemuel
,
being
the
eldest
,
did
murmur
against
their
father
,—.
And
they
did
munaur
because
they
knew
not
the
dealings
of
that
God
who
had
created
them
.
Neither
did
they
believe
that
Jerusalem
,
that
great
city
,
could
be
destroyed
aecording
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
.
And
they
were
like
unto
the
Jews
,
which
were
at
Jerusalem
,
which
sought
to
take
away
the
life
of
my
father
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
my
father
did
speak
unto
them
in
the
valley
of
Lemuel
,
with
power
,
being
filled
with
the
spirit
,
until
their
frames
did
shake
before
him
.
And
he
did
confound
them
,
that
they
durst
not
utter
against
-
him
;
wherefore
they
did
do
as
he
commanded
them
.
And
my
father
dwelt
in
2
tent
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
being
exceeding
young
,
nevertheless
being
large
in
stature
,
and
also
having
great
desires
to
know
of
the
mysteries
of
God
,
wherefore
I
did
cry
Yate
the
Lord
;
and
behold
he
did
visite
,
and
did
soften
my
[File:013]
heart
that
I
did
believe
all
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
my
father
;
wherefore
I
did
not
rebel
against
him
like
unto
my
brothers
.
And
1
spake
unto
Sam
,
making
known
unto
him
the
things
which
the
Lord
had
manifested
unto
me
by
his
Holy
Spirit
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
believed
in
my
words
;
but
be
hold
Laman
and
Lemuel
would
not
hearken
unto
my
words
:
And
being
grieved
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
,
I
cried
unto
the
Lord
for
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
spake
unto
me
,
saying
:
Blessed
art
thou
,
Nephi
,
because
of
thy
faith
,
for
thou
hast
sought
me
diligently
,
with
lowliness
of
heart
.
And
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
shall
prosper
,
and
shalt
be
led
to
a
land
of
promise
;
yea
,
even
a
land
which
I
have
prepared
for
you
;
yea
,
a
land
which
is
choice
above
all
other
lands
,
And
inasmuch
as
thy
brethren
shall
rebel
againt
thee
,
they
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
.
And
inasmuch
as
thou
shalt
keep
my
commandments
,
thou
shalt
be
made
a
ruler
and
a
teacher
over
thy
brethren
.
For
behold
,
in
that
day
that
they
shall
rebel
against
me
,
1
will
curse
the
even
with
a
sore
curse
,
and
they
shall
have
no
power
o
thy
seed
,
except
they
shall
rebel
against
me
also
.
And
i
so
he
that
they
rebel
against
me
,
they
shall
be
a
scourge
uni
thy
seed
,
to
stir
them
up
in
the
ways
of
remembrance
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
returned
from
speaking
with
the
Lord
,
to
the
tent
of
my
father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
spake
unto
me
,
saying
:
Behold
I
have
dreamed
a
dream
,
in
the
which
the
Lord
hath
commanded
me
that
thou
and
thy
brethren
shall
return
to
Jerusalem
.
For
behold
,
Laban
hath
the
record
of
the
Jews
,
and
also
a
genealogy
of
my
forefathers
,
ae
they
are
engrayen
upon
plates
of
brass
.
Wherefore
the
d
hath
commanded
me
{hat
thou
and
thy
brothers
should
go
unto
the
house
of
Labanjsand
seek
the
records
,
and
bring
them
down
hither
into
the
wilderness
.
And
now
,
behold
,
thy
brothers
murmur
,
saying
:
It
is
a
hard
thing
which
I
have
required
of
them
;
but
behold
I
have
not
required
it
of
them
,
bui
,
it
is
2
commandment
of
the
Lord
.
Therefore
go
,
my
son
,
and
thou
shalt
be
favored
of
the
Lord
,
because
thou
hast
rot
murmured
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
said
unto
my
father
,
F
will
go
and
do
the
things
which
the
Lord
hath
commanded
,
for
T
know
that
the
Lond
giveth
no
conmandments
unto
the
[File:014]
children
of
men
,
save
he
shall
prepare
a
way
for
them
that
they
may
accomplish
the
thing
which
he
commandeth
them
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
had
heard
these
:
words
,
he
was
exceeding
glad
,
for
he
knew
that
I
had
been
blessed
of
the
Lord
.
And
I
,
Nephi
,
and
my
brethren
,
took
our
journey
in
the
wilderness
with
our
tents
,
to
go
up
to
the
land
of
Jerusalem
.
Ail
it
came
to
pass
that
when
we
had
come
up
to
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
I
and
my
brethren
did
consult
onc
with
another
;
and
wercast
lots
which
of
us
should
go
in
unto
the
house
of
Laban
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lot
fell
upon
Laman
;
and
Laan
went
in
unto
the
house
of
Laban
,
and
he
talked
with
him
as
he
sat
in
his
house
.
And
he
desired
of
Laban
the
reeords
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
which
con
tained
the
geucalogy
of
my
father
.
And
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
Laban
was
angry
,
and
thrust
him
out
from
his
presence
;
and
he
would
not
that
he
should
have
the
records
.
Wherefore
he
said
unto
him
,
behold
then
art
a
robber
,
and
will
slay
thee
,
But
Lamun
fled
out
of
is
presence
,
and
told
the
things
which
Laban
had
done
,
unto
,
And
we
began
to
be
exceeding
sorrowful
,
and
my
brethren
about
to
return
unto
my
father
in
the
wilderness
.
But
hold
Tsaid
unto
them
,
that
as
the
Lordliveth
,
and
as
we
live
,
we
will
not
go
down
unto
our
father
in
the
wilderness
,
until
we
have
accomplished
the
thing
which
the
Lord
hath
commanded
us
,
Wherefore
let
us
be
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
;
therefore
let
us
go
down
to
the
land
of
our
father's
inheritance
,
for
behold
he
left
gold
and
silver
,
and
alt
manner
of
riches
.
And
all
this
he
hath
done
,
because
of
the
commandmeiits
of
the
Lord
:
for
he
knowing
that
Jerusalem
must
he
destroyed
,
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
peopl
For
behold
,
they
have
rejected
the
words
of
the
prophets
Wherefore
if
my
father
should
dwell
in
the
land
after
that
he
hath
been
commanded
to
flee
out
of
the
land
,
behold
he
would
also
perish
,
Wherefore
it
must
needs
be
that
he
flee
out
of
the
land
,
And
behold
,
it
is
wisdom
in
God
that
we
should
obtain
these
records
,
that
we
might
preserve
unto
our
children
the
language
of
our
fathers
;
and
also
that
we
may
preserve
unto
them
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
hy
the
mouth
of
ail
the
holy
prophets
,
which
have
becn
delivered
unto
them
by
the
spirit
and
power
of
God
,
since
the
world
began
,
even
down
voto
this
present
time
.
[File:015]
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
this
manner
of
language
did
1
persuade
my
brethren
,
that
they
might
be
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
ef
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
thal
we
went
down
to
tlie
land
of
our
inheritance
,
and
we
did
gather
together
our
gold
,
and
our
silver
,
and
our
precious
thit
And
after
that
we
had
gathered
these
things
together
,
we
went
up
again
anto
the
house
of
Laban
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
went
in
unto
Laban
,
and
desired
him
that
he
would
give
unto
us
the
records
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
for
which
we
would
give
unto
him
our
gold
,
and
our
silver
,
and
all
our
precious
things
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Laban
saw
our
property
,
and
that
it
was
exceeding
great
,
he
did
Just
after
it
,
insomuch
that
he
thrust
us
out
,
and
sent
his
servanis
to
slay
us
,
that
he
might
obtain
our
property
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
flee
before
the
servants
of
Laban
,
and
we
were
obliged
to
leave
behind
our
property
,
and
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
Laban
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
fled
into
the
wilderness
,
and
the
servants
of
Laban
did
not
overtake
us
,
and
we
hid
ourselves
in
the
cavity
of
arock
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Laman
wa
:
angry
with
me
,
and
also
with
my
father
;
and
also
was
Lemuel}
for
he
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
Laman
.
Wherefore
[i
man
and
Lemuel
did
speak
many
hard
words
unto
us
,
their
younger
brothers
,
and
they
did
smite
us
even
with
a
rod
,
And
it
came
to
pass
as
they
smote
us
with
a
rod
,
behold
an
angel
of
the
Lord
came
and
stood
before
them
,
and
he
spake
untothem
saying
:
Why
do
ye
smite
your
younger
brother
with
arod
?
Know
yenot
that
the
Lord
hath
chosen
him
to
be
a
ruler
over
you
,
and
this
because
of
your
iniquities
?
Behold
thou
shalt
go
up
to
Jerusalem
again
,
and
the
Lord
will
deliver
an
into
your
hands
,
And
after
that
the
angel
had
spoken
ous
,
he
departed
,
And
after
that
the
angel
had
departed
,
Laman
and
Lemuel
again
began
to
murmur
,
saying
,
how
is
it
possible
that
the
Lord
will
deliver
Laban
into
our
hands
?
Behold
be
is
a
mighty
man
,
and
he
can
command
filty
,
yea
,
even
he
can
slay
fifty
;
then
why
not
us
?
And
it
came
to
pass
that
J
spake
unto
my
brethren
,
saying
:
Let
us
go
up
again
unto
Jerusalem
,
and
let
us
be
faithful
in
icecping
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
;
for
behold
he
is
mightier
than
all
the
earth
,
then
why
not
mightier
than
Laban
and
his
fifty
,
yea
,
or
even
than
his
tens
of
thousands
.
Therefore
letus
go
up
;
let
us
be
strong
like
unto
Moses
:
For
he
truly
spake
unto
the
waters
of
the
Red
Sca
,
and
they
divided
[File:016]
hither
and
thither
,
and
our
fathers
came
through
out
of
captivity
on
dry
ground
,
and
the
armies
of
Pharaoh
did
follow
and
were
drowned
in
the
waters
of
the
Red
Sea
,
Now
behold
ye
know
that
this
is
trae
;
and
ye
also
know
that
an
angel
hath
spoken
unto
you
,
wherefore
can
ye
doubt
,
Let
us
go
up
;
the
Lord
is
able
to
deliver
us
,
even
as
our
fathers
,
and
to
destroy
Laban
,
even
as
the
Egyptians
.
Now
when
I
had
spoken
these
words
,
they
were
yet
wroth
,
and
did
still
continue
to
murmur
;
Nevertheless
they
did
follow
me
up
until
we
came
without
the
walls
of
Jerusalem
.
And
it
was
by
night
;
and
I
caused
that
they
should
hide
themselyes
without
the
walls
.
And
after
that
they
had
hid
themselves
,
I
,
Nephi
,
crept
into
the
city
and
went
forth
towards
the
house
of
Laban
.
And
I
was
led
by
the
spirit
,
not
knowing
heforehand
the
things
which
I
should
do
.
Nevertheless
I
went
forth
,
and
as
I
came
near
unto
the
house
of
Laban
,
I
beheld
a
man
,
and
he
had
fallen
to
the
earth
before
me
,
for
he
was
drunken
with
wine
.
And
when
I
came
to
him
,
I
found
that
it
was
Laban
.
And
I
beheld
his
sword
,
and
I
drew
it
forth
from
the
sheath
thereof
,
and
the
hilt
thereof
was
of
pure
gold
,
and
the
workmanship
thereof
was
exceeding
fine
;
and
1
saw
that
the
blade
thereof
was
of
the
most
precious
sicel
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
was
constrained
by
the
spirit
that
{
should
kill
Laban
;
but
I
said
in
my
heart
,
never
at
any
time
haye
I
shed
the
blood
of
man
,
and
¥
shrunk
and
would
that
I
might
not
slay
him
.
And
the
spirit
saith
unto
me
again
,
behold
the
Lord
hath
delivered
him
into
thy
hands
;
yea
,
and
J
also
knew
that
he
had
sought
to
take
away
mine
own
life
;
yea
,
and
he
would
not
hearken
unto
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
;
and
he
also
had
taken
away
our
property
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
spirit
said
unto
me
again
,
s
him
,
forthe
Lord
hath
delivered
himinto
thy
hands
.
Behold
Lord
slayeth
the
wicked
to
bring
forth
his
righteous
purposes
:
It
is
better
that
one
man
should
perish
,
than
that
a
nation
should
dwindle
and
perish
in
unbelief
.
And
now
,
when
I
,
Nephi
,
had
heard
these
words
,
1
remembered
the
words
of
the
Lord
which
he
spake
unto
me
in
the
wilderness
,
saying
,
that
inasmuch
as
thy
seed
shall
keep
my
commandments
,
they
shall
prosper
in
the
land
of
promise
,—
¥ca
,
and
[also
thought
that
they
could
not
keep
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
according
to
the
law
of
Moses
,
save
they
should
have
the
law
.
And
I
also
knew
that
the
law
was
engrayen
upon
the
plates
of
brass
.
And
again
—
I
knew
that
[File:017]
the
Lord
had
delivered
Laban
into
my
hands
,
for
this
cause
:
that
I
might
obtain
the
records
according
to
his
commmandmenis
.
Therefore
I
did
obey
the
voice
of
the
spirit
,
and
took
Laban
by
the
hair
of
the
head
,
and
I
smote
off
his
head
with
his
own
sword
.
And
after
that
[had
smitten
off
his
head
with
his
own
sword
,
[took
the
garments
of
Laban
and
put
them
upon
mine
own
body
;
yea
,
even
every
whit
;
and
I
did
gird
on
bis
armour
about
my
loins
.
And
after
that
1
had
done
this
,
]
went
forth
unto
the
treasury
of
Laban
.
And
as
I
went
forth
towards
the
treasury
of
Laban
,
behold
Isaw
the
servant
of
Laban
which
had
the
keys
of
the
treasury
.
And
I
commanded
him
in
the
voice
of
Lahan
,
that
he
should
go
with
me
intothe
treasury
;
andhe
supposed
me
to
be
his
master
,
Laban
,
for
he
beheld
the
garments
,
and
also
the
sword
girted
about
my
loins
.
And
he
spake
unto
me
concerning
the
elders
of
the
Jews
,
he
knowing
that
his
master
Laban
had
been
out
by
night
among
them
.
And
I
spake
unto
him
as
if
it
had
been
Laban
.
And
I
also
spake
unto
him
that
I
should
carry
the
engravings
which
were
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
to
my
elder
brethren
,
which
were
without
the
walls
.
And
I
also
bade
him
that
he
should
follow
me
,
nd
he
,
supposing
that
I
spake
of
the
brethren
of
the
church
,
and
that
[
was
truly
that
Laban
whom
!
had
slain
,
wherefore
he
did
follow
me
.
And
he
spake
unto
me
many
times
concerning
the
elders
of
the
Jews
,
as
I
went
forth
unto
my
brethren
,
which
were
without
the
walls
.
And
il
came
to
pass
that
when
Laman
saw
me
,
he
was
exceedingly
frightencd
,
and
also
Lemuel
and
Sam
.
And
they
fled
from
before
my
presence
;
for
they
supposed
it
was
Laban
,
and
that
he
had
slain
me
,
and
had
sought
to
take
away
their
lives
also
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
,
that
I
called
after
them
,
and
they
did
ear
me
;
wherefore
they
did
cease
to
flee
from
my
presence
.
And
it
came
to
pass
,
that
when
the
servant
of
Laban
beheld
my
brethren
,
he
begaii'to
tremble
,
and
was
about
to
flee
from
before
me
and
retjfra
to
the
city
of
Jerusalem
.
And
now
I
,
Nephi
,
being
a
man
large
in
stature
,
and
also
haying
received
much
strength
of
the
Lord
,
therefore
I
did
a
upon
the
servent
of
Laban
,
and
held
him
,
that
he
should
not
flee
.
t
And
It
came
to
pass
that
I
spake
with
him
,
that
if
he
would
hearken
unto
my
words
,
as
the
Lord
liveth
and
as
I
live
,
even
so
that
if
he
would
hearkea
unto
our
words
,
we
would
spare
[File:018]
his
life
.
And
I
spake
unto
him
,
eyen
with
an
oath
,
that
he
need
not
fear
;
thai
he
should
be
a
free
man
like
unto
us
,
if
he
would
go
down
in
the
wilderness
with
us
.
And
I
also
spake
unto
him
,
saying
,
surely
the
Lord
hath
commanded
us
to
do
this
thing
.
Aud
shall
we
not
be
diligent
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
?
Therefore
,
if
thou
wilt
go
down
into
the
wilderness
to
my
father
,
thou
shalt
have
place
with
us
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Zoram
did
take
courage
at
the
words
whieh
I
spake
.
Now
Zoran
was
the
nume
of
the
servant
;
and
he
promised
that
he
would
go
down
into
the
wil
derness
unto
our
futher
.
And
he
also
made
an
oath
unto
us
thar
he
would
tarry
with
us
from
that
time
forth
.
Now
we
=
were
desirous
that
he
should
tarry
with
us
for
this
cause
:
that
the
Jews
might
not
know
concerning
our
tight
into
the
wilderness
,
lest
they
should
pursue
us
and
destroy
us
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Zoram
had
made
an
oath
unto
us
,
our
fears
did
cease
concerning
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
took
the
plates
of
brass
and
the
servant
of
Laban
,
and
departed
into
the
wilderness
,
and
journied
unto
the
tent
of
our
father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
came
down
into
the
;
+
ie
unto
our
father
,
behold
he
was
filled
with
jov
,
and
also
my
mother
,
Sariah
,
was
exceeding
glad
,
for
sic
truly
had
mourned
because
of
us
;
for
she
had
supposed
that
we
had
perished
in
the
wilderness
;
and
she
also
had
complained
againse
My
father
,
telling
him
that
he
was
a
visionary
man
;
saying
,
ao
hast
led
us
forth
from
the
land
of
bur
inheri

_
And
after
this
manner
of
language
had
my
mother
complained
against
my
father
.
And
it
had
came
to
pass
that
my
father
spake
unto
her
saying
:
Lknovy
that
[
am
a
visionary
mang
for
if
I
had
not
sce
,
thd
things
of
God
ina

,
I
shoul
not
have
known
i
goodness
of
God
,
but
had
tarried
at
Jernsalem
and
had
perished
with
my
brethren
.
But
beheld
,
Witave
obtained
a
land
of
promise
,
in
the
which
thing
I
do
rejoftes

,
and
I
know
that
the
Lord
will
deliver
my
sous
out
of
RE
hands
of
Laban
,
and
bring
them
down
again
unto
us
in
the
wilderness
.
And
aftenthis
manner
of
language
did
my
father
Lehi
comfort
my
mother
Sariah
,
concerning
us
,
while
we
journied
in
the
wilderness
up
to
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
to
obtaiti
the
record
of
the
Jews
.
And
when
we
had
returned
to
the
tdnt
of
my
father
,
behold
[File:019]
was
full
,
and
my
mother
was
coinforted
;
and
she
spake
,
saying
:
Now
I
know
of
a
surety
that
the
Lord
hath
vommanded
my
husband
to
flee
into
the
wilderness
;
yea
,
and
I
also
know
of
a
surety
that
the
Lord
hath
protected
my
Sons
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
Laban
,
and
gave
them
power
whereby
they
could
accomplish
the
thing
which
the
Lord
hath
commanded
them
.
And
afler
this
manner
of
language
did
she
speak
.
And
it
caine
to
pass
that
they
did
rejoice
exceedingly
,
and
did
offer
sacrifice
and
burnt
offerings
unto
the
Lord
;
and
they
gave
thanks
unto
the
God
of
Israel
,
And
after
that
they
had
given
thanks
unto
the
God
of
israel
,
my
father
Lehi
took
the
records
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
and
he
did
search
them
from
the
beginning
.
And
he
beheld
that
they
did
contain
the
five
Books
of
Moses
,
which
gave
an_account
of
the
creation
of
the
world
,
and
also
of
Adam
and
Eve
,
which
was
our
first
parents
;
and
also
a
record
of
the
Jews
from
the
beginning
,
even
down
to
the
conimencement
of
the
reign
of
Zedekiah
,
King
of
Judah
;
and
also
the
prophecies
of
the
Holy
prophets
,
from
the
beginning
,
even
down
to
the
commeneement
of
the
reign
of
Zedekiah
;
and
also
many
pe
ecies
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
Jeremiah
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
my
father
Lehi
also
found
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
a
genealogy
of
bis
fathers
;
wherefore
he
knew
that
he
was
a
descendant
of
Joseph
;
yea
,
even
that
Joseph
which
was
the
son
of
Jacob
,
which
was
sold
into
Egypt
,
and
~
which
was
preserved
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
that
he
might
preserve
his
father
Jacob
and
all
his
household
from
perishin
;
with
famine
.
And
they
were
also
led
out
of
captivity
a
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
,
by
that
same
God
who
had
preseryed
them
,
And
thus
my
father
Lehi
did
discover
the
genealo
of
his
fathers
.
And
Laban
also
was
a
descendant
of
Joseph
,
wherefore
he
and
his
fathers
had
kept
the
records
,
_And
now
when
my
futher
saw
all
these
things
,
Le
was
filled
with
the
spirit
,
and
began
to
prophesy
concerning
his
seed
;
that
these
plates
of
brass
should
o
forth
unto
ail
nations
,
kindreds
,
tongues
,
and
people
which
were
of
his
seed
,
Wherefore
he
said
that
these
plates
of
brass
should
never
perish
;
neithershould
they
he
dimmed
any
more
by
time
.
And
ke
prophesied
many
things
concerning
his
seed
.
And
it
eame
to
pass
that
thus
far
I
and
my
father
had
kept
the
commandments
wherewith
the
Lord
had
commanded
as
.
And
we
had
obtained
the
record
which
the
Lord
had
comman
[File:020]
ded
us
,
and
searched
them
and
found
that
they
were
desirable
;
yea
,
even
of
great
worth
unto
us
,
insomuch
that
we
could
preserve
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
unto
our
children
.
Wherefore
it
was
wisdom
in
the
Lord
that
we
should
carry
them
with
us
,
as
we
journied
in
the
wilderness
towards
the
Fand
of

_
CHAPTER
IL
Awp
now
I
,
Nephi
,
do
not
give
the
genealogy
of
my
fathers
in_
this
part
.
of
my
record
;
neither
at
any
time
shall
I
give
it
after
upon
these
plates
which
I
am
writing
;
for
it
is
given
in
the
—
record
which
has
heen
kept
by
my
father
;
wherefore
I
do
not
write
it
in
this
work
,
For
it
sufficeth
me
to
say
,
that
we
are
a
descendant
of
Joseph
.
And
it
mattereth
not
to
me
that
1am
particular
to
give
a
full
account
of
all
the
things
of
my
father
,
for
they
cannot
be
written
upon
these
plates
,
for
I
desive
the
room
,
that
may
write
of
the
things
of
God
.
For
the
fullness
of
mine
intent
is
that
I
may
persuade
men
to
come
unto
the
God
of
Abraham
,
and
the
God
of
Isaac
,
and
the
God
of
Jacob
,
aud
be
saved
.
Wherefore
the
things
which
are
pleasing
unto
the
world
,
I
do
not
write
,
but
the
things
which
are
pleasing
unto
God
and
unto
them
which
are
not
of
the
world
.
Wherefore
1
shall
give
commandment
unto
my
seed
,
that
they
shall
not
occupy
these
plates
with
things
which
are
ot
of
worth
unto
the
children
of
men
.
And
now
I
would
on
.
yemight
know
,
that
after
my
father
Lehi
had
made
an
end
of
-
prophesying
concerning
his
seed
,
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
spake
unto
him
again
,
saying
,
that
it
was
not
mete
for
im
,
Lehi
,
that
he
should
take
his
family
into
.
the
nl
alone
;
but
that
his
sons
should
take
daughters
to
wife
,
tha
!
they
might
raise
up
seed
unto
the
Lord
in
the
land
of
promise
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
commanded
him
that
.
I
,
Nephi
,
and
my
brethren
,
should
again
return
unto
the
land
of
:
Jerusalem
,
and
bring
down
Ishmael
and
his
family
into
the
wilderness
,
_And
iteame
to
passthat
I
,
Nephi
,
did
again
,
with
my
breth
Ten
,
go
forth
into
the
wilderness
to
go
up
to
Jerusalem
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
went
up
unto
the
house
of
Ishmacl
,
—
and
we
did
gain
favor
in
the
sight
of
Ishmael
,
insomuch
that
—
we
did
speak
unto
him
the
words
of
the
Lord
.
[File:021]
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
soften
the
heart
of
Ishmael
,
and
also
his
household
,
insomuch
that
they
took
their
journey
with
us
down
into
the
wilderness
to
the
tent
of
our
father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
we
journied
in
the
wilderness
,
behold
,
Laman
and
Lemuel
,
and
two
of
the
daughters
of
Ishmael
,
and
the
two
sons
of
Ishmael
,
and
their
families
,
did
vebel
agamst
us
;
yea
,
against
I
,
Nephi
,
and
Sam
,
and
their
father
,
Ishmael
,
and
his
wife
,
and
his
three
other
daughters
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
which
rebellion
,
they
were
desirous
to
return
unto
the
land
of
Jerusalem
.
And
now
I
,
Nephi
,
being
grieved
for
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
,
therefore
spake
unto
them
,
saying
;
yea
,
even
unto
Laman
and
unto
T
.
emuel
,
behold
,
thou
art
mine
elder
brethren
;
and
how
is
it
that
ye
are
so
hard
in
your
hearts
,
and
so
blind
in
your
minds
,
that
ye
have
need
that
I
,
your
younger
brother
,
should
speak
unto
you
,
yea
,
and
set
an
example
for
you
?
How
is
it
that
ye
have
not
hearkened
unto
the
word
of
the
Lord
?
How
is
it
that
ye
have
forgotten
that
ye
have
seen
an
angel
of
the
Lord
?
Yea
,
and
how
is
itthat
ye
have
forgotten
how
great
things
the
Lord
haih
done
tor
us
,
in
delivering
us
out
of
the
hands
of
Laban
,
and
also
that
we
should
obtain
the
record
?
Yea
,
and
how
is
it
that
ye
have
forgotten
that
the
Lord
is
able
to
do
all
things
,
according
io
his
will
,
for
the
children
of
men
,
if
itso
be
that
they
exercise
faith
in
him
;
wherefore
,
Jet
us
be
faithful
in
him
.
And
if
it
se
be
that
we
are
faithful
in
him
,
we
shall
obtain
the
land
of
promise
;
and
ye
shall
know
at
some
future
period
,
that
the
word
of
the
Lord
shall
be
fulfilled
,
concerning
the
destructio
:
salem
;
for
all
things
which
the
Lord
hath
spo
the
destruction
of
Jerusalem
,
must
be
fulfilled
.
dhe
spirit
of
the
Lord
ceaseth
soon
to
strive
with
them
;
for
,
be
-.
hold
,
they
have
rejected
the
prophets
,
and
Jeremiah
have
they
east
into
prison
,
And
they
have
sought
to
take
away
the
life
of
my
father
,
insomuch
that
they
have
driven
him
out
of
the
land
.
Now
,
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
if
ye
will
retun
unto
Jerusalem
,
ye
shall
also
perish
with
them
.
And
now
,
if
ye
have
choice
,
go
up
to
the
land
,
and
remember
the
words
which
I
speak
unto
you
,
thatif
ye
go
,
ye
will
also
perish
;
for
thus
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
constraincth
me
that
I
should
spealr
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
,
Nephi
,
hadspoken
these
words
unto
my
brethren
,
they
were
angry
with
me
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
lay
their
hands
upon
me
;
for
,
heheld
,
they
were
exceeding
wroth
;
and
they
did
bind
me
with
cord
,
.
[File:022]
for
they
xouzht
to
take
away
my
life
,
that
they
might
leave
me
_
in
the
wilderness
,
to
be
devoured
by
wild
heasts
.
i
But
itcame
to
pass
that
[prayed
unto
the
Lord
,
saying
:
G
Lord
,
according
to
my
faith
which
is
in
thee
,
wilt
thou
deliver
me
from
the
hands
of
my
brethren
;
yea
,
even
give
me
strength
that
1
may
burst
these
bands
with
which
fam
bound
.
Andit
came
to
pass
that
when
I
had
said
these
words
,
hehold
,
the
bands
were
loosed
{rom
off
my
hands
end
feet
,
and
1
stood
before
my
brethren
,
and
1
spake
unto
themagain
.
And
jt
came
to
pass
that
they
were
angry
with
me
again
,
and
sought
—
to
lay
hands
upon
me
;
but
,
behold
,
one
of
the
daughters
of
©
fehmael
,
yea
,
and
also
her
mother
,
end
one
of
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
did
plead
with
my
brethren
,
insomuch
that
they
did
soften
their
hearts
;
and
they
did
cease
striving
to
take
away
wy
Jife
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
sorrowful
,
because
of
their
wickedness
,
insomuch
that
they
did
bow
down
before
-
me
,
and
did
plead
with
me
,
that
I
would
forgive
them
of
the
thing
that
they
had
done
against
me
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
frankly
forgive
them
all
that
they
had
done
,
and
J
did
exhort
them
that
they
would
pray
unto
the
Lord
their
God
,
for
forgiveness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
so
.
And
after
that
they
had
done
praying
unto
the
Lord
,
we
did
again
travel
on
our
journey
toward
the
tent
of
our
father
.
And
it
came
to
,
pass
that
we
did
come
down
unto
the
tent
ef
our
father
.
And
after
that
land
my
brethren
,
and
all
the
se
of
Ishmael
,
had
come
down
unto
the
tent
of
my
father
,
ey
did
give
thanks
unto
the
Lord
their
God
;
and
they
did
offer
eacrifice
and
burnt
offerings
unto
him
.
Andit
came
to
pass
that
we
had
gathered
together
all

of
seeds
of
every
kind
;
both
of
grain
of
every
kind
,
and
alvo
of

of
every

And
it
came
to

that
while
my

tarried
in

And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
aman
,
and
he
was
dressed
it
a
white
robe
;
and
he
came
and
stood
before
me
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
spake
unto
me
,
and
bade
me
follow
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
us
1
followed
him
,
and
after
I
had
followed
him
,
I
beheld
myself
that
Iwasin
adark
and
dreary

waste
.
And
after
that
I
had
travelled
for
the
space
of
many
hours
in
darkness
,
1
began
to
pray
unto
the
Lord
,
ihat
he
would
have
mercy
on
me
,
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
tender
mercies
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
had
prayed
unta
the
Lord
,
T
beheld
a
large
and
spacious
field
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
a
tree
,
whose
fruit
was
desirable
,
to
make
one
happy
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
]
did
go
forth
,
and
partake
of
the
fruit
thereof
;
and
I
beheld
that
it
was
movt
sweet
,
above
all
that
Iever
had
before
tasted
.
Yea
,
and
I
bebeld
that
the
fruit
thercof
was
white
,
to
exceed
all
the
whiteness
that
I
had
ever
seen
.
And
as
I
partook
of
the
fruit
thereof
,
it
filled
my
souk
with
exceeding
great
joy
;
whercfore
,
I
began
to
be
desirous
_
that
my
family
should
partake
of
i
also
;
for
Tknew
that
it
vas
desirous
above
all
other
fruit
,
And
as
I
cast
my
eyes
round
about
,
that
perhaps
I
might
discover
my
family
also
,
1
beheld
a
river
of
water
;
and
it
ran
along
,
and
it
was
near
the
tree
of
which
I
was
partaking
the
fruit
.
And
I
looked
to
behold
from
whence
it
came
;
and
[
saw
the
head
thereof
,
a
little
way
off
;
and
at
the
head
thereof
,
I
behel
mother
Sariah
,
and
Sam
,
and
Nephi
;
and
they
stood
knew
not
whither
they
should
go
.
ce
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beckoned
unto
them
;
an
did
say
unto
them
,
with
a
loud
voice
,
that
they
should
:
unto
me
,
and
partake
of
the
fruit
,
which
was
desirable
above
all
other
finit
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
come
unto
me
,
and
par
-
~
take
of
the
fruit
also
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
was
desirous
that
Laman
and
Lemuel
should
come
and
partake
of
the
fruit
also
;
wherefore
,
I
cast
mine
eyes
towards
the
head
of
the
river
,
that
perhaps
I
might
see
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
them
,
but
they
would
not
come
unto
me
.
And
I
beheld
a
rod
of
izoa
;
and
it
extended
along
the
bank
of
the
river
,
and
led
to'
the
tree
by
which
1
stood
.
And
I
also
beheld
a
straight
apd
narrow
-
path
,
which
came
along
by
the
rod
of
iron
,
even
to
.
the
tree
by
which
E
stood
;
and
it
also
led
by
the
headof
the
fountain
,
unto
alarge
and
spacious
field
,
as
if
it
had
been

warld
;
and
I
saw
nuin=
[File:024]
berless
concourses
of
people
;
many
of
whom
were
pressing
forward
,
that
they
might
obtain
the
path
which
jed
unto
the
tree
by
which
I
stood
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
come
forth
,
and
commence
in
the
path
which
led
to
the
tree
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
arose
a
mist
of
darkness
;
yea
,
even
an
exceeding
great
mist
of
darkness
,
insomuch
that
they
which
had
commenced
in
the
path
,
did
lose
their
way
,
that
(
hey
wandered
off
,
and
were
Jost
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
others
pressing
forward
;
and
they
came
forth
,
and
caught
hold
of
the
end
of
the
rod
of
iron
;
and
they
did
press
forward
through
the
mist
of
darkness
,
clinging
to
the
rod
of
iron
,
even
until
they
did
come
forth
and
pariake
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
,
And
after
that
they
had
partaken
of
the
fruit
of
the
trec
,
they
did
cast
their
eyes
about
as
if
they
were
ashamed
.
And
Jalso
cast
my
eyes
round
about
,
and
beheld
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
of
water
,
a
great
and
spacious
building
;
and
it
stood
as
it
were
in
the
air
,
high
above
the
earth
;
and
it
was
filled
with
people
,
both
old
and
young
,
both
male
and
female
;
and
their
manncr
of
dress
was
exceeding
fine
;
and
they
were
in
the
attitude
of
mocking
and
pointing
their
fingers
towards
those
which
had
come
at
,
and
were
parta
king
of
the
fruit
.
And
after
that
they
had
tasted
of
the
{ruit
,
they
were
ashamed
,
because
of
those
that
were
seofting
at
them
;
and
they
fell
away
into
forbidden
paths
,
and
were
lost
.
And
now
I
,
Nephi
,
do
not
speak
all
the
words
of
my
father
.
But
,
to
be
short
in
writing
:
Behold
,
he
saw
other
multitudes
pressing
forward
;
and
they
came
and
caught
hold
of
the
end
of
the
rod
of
iron
;
and_
they
did
press
their
way
forward
,
continually
holding
fast
to
the
rod
of
iron
,
until
they
came
forth
and
fell
down
,
and
partook
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
.
And
he
also
saw
other
multitudes
,
feeling
their
way
towards
that
great
and
spacious
building
.
And
it
,
came
to
pass
that
many
were
drowned
in
the
depths
of
the
fountain
;
and
many
were
Jost
from
his
view
,
wandering
in
strange
roads
.
And
great
was
the
multitude
that
did
enter
into
that
strange
building
.
And
after
that
they
did
enter
into
.
that
building
,
they
did
point
the
finger
of
scorn
at
me
,
and
those
that
were
partaking
of
the
fruit
also
;
but
we
heeded
them
not
.
These
are
the
words
of
my
father
:
For
asmany
as
heeded
them
,
had
fallen
away
.
And
Laman
and
Lemuel
partook
not
of
the
fruit
,
saith
my
father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
afler
my
father
had
spoken
all
the
[File:025]
words
of
his
dream
or
vision
,
which
were
many
,
he
said
unte
us
,
because
of
these
things
which
he
saw
in
a
vison
,
he
exceedingly
feared
for
Laman
and
Lemuel
;
yea
,
he
feared
lest
they
should
be
cast
off
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
;
and
he
did
exhort
them
then
with
all
the
feeling
of
a
tender
parent
,
that
ihey
would
hearken
to
his
words
,
in
that
,
perhaps
the
Lord
would
be
merciful
to
them
,
and
not
cast
them
off
;
yea
,
my
father
did
preach
unto
them
.
And
after
that
he
had
preached
unto
them
,
and
also
prophesied
unto
thein
of
many
things
,
he
bade
them
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
;
and
he
did
cease
speaking
unto
them
.
And
all
these
things
did
my
father
sec
,
and
hear
,
and
speak
,
as
he
dwelt
in
a
tent
,
in
the
valley
of
Lemuel
;
and
also
a
great
many
more
things
,
which
cannot
be
written
upon
these
plates
.
And
now
,
as
I
have
spoken
concerning
these
plates
,
behold
,
they
are
not
the
plates
upon
which
I
make
a
full
account
of
the
history
of
my
people
;
for
the
plates
upon
which
Y
make
a
full
account
of
my
people
,
I
have
given
thename
of
Nephi
;
wherefore
,
they
arc
called
the
plates
of
Nephi
,
after
mine
own
name
;
and
these
plates
also
,
are
called
the
plates
of
Nephi
.
Nevertheless
,
[have
received
a
commandment
of
the
Lord
,
that
I
should
make
these
plates
,
for
the
special
purpose
that
there
should
be
an
account
engraven
of
the
ministry
of
my
people
.
Upon
the
other
plates
should
be
engraven
an
ac
count
of
the
reign
of
the
Kings
,
and
the
wars
,
and
contentions
—
of
my
people
;
wherefore
,
these
plates
are
,
for
the
more
part
,
ofthe
ministry
;
and
the
other
plates
are
,
for
the
more
part
,
of
the
reign
of
the
Kings
,
and
the
wars
,
and
contentions
of
my
people
.
Wherefore
,
the
Lord
hath
commanded
me
to
make
these
plates
,
for
a
wise
purpose
in
him
;
which
purpose
,
1
know
not
,
But
the
Lord
knowetb
all
things
,
from
the
beginning
;
wherefore
,
he
prepareth
a
way
to
accomplish
all
his
works
among
the
children
of
men
;
for
behold
,
he
hath
all
power
unto
the
fulfilling
of
all
his
words
.
And
thus
itis
,
Amen

CHAPTER
Hi
.
Awp
now
J
,
Nephi
,
proceed
to
give
an
account
upon
these
plates
,
of
my
proceedings
,
and
my
reign
and
ministry
;
wherefore
,
to
proceed
with
mine
account
,
I
must
speak
somewhat
of
the
things
of
my
father
,
and
also
of
my
brethren
,
ae
[File:026]
For
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
after
my
father
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
the
words
of
his
dream
,
and
also
of
exhorting
them
to
all
diligence
,
he
spake
unto
them
concerning
the
,
Jews
:
How
that
after
they
were
destroyed
,
yea
,
even
that
great
city
Jerusalem
;
and
that
many
were
carried
away
captive
into
Babylon
;
that
according
to
the
own
due
time
of
the
Lord
,
they
should
return
again
;
yea
,
even
be
brought
back
out
of
captivity
;
and
after
they
are
broughtyback
out
of
captivity
,
to
possess
again
the
land
of
their
inheritance
.
Yea
,
even
six
hundred
years
from
the
time
that
my
father
lef
Jerusalem
,
a
Prophet
would
the
Lord
God
raisc
up
among
ihe
Jews
;
yea
,
even
a
Messiah
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
a
Saviour
of
the
world
.
And
he
also
spake
concerning
the
prophets
;
How
great
a
number
had
testified
of
these
things
,
concerning
this
Messiah
,
of
which
he
had
spoken
,
or
this
Redeemer
of
the
world
.
Wherefore
,
all
mankind
was
ina
lost
and
in
a
fallen
state
;
and
ever
would
be
,
save
they
should
rely
on
this
Redeemer
,
And
he
spake
also
,
concerning
a
prophet
,
which
should
come
before
the
Messiah
,
to
prepare
the
way
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
even
he
should
go
forth
and
cry
in
the
wilderness
,
Prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
Lord
,
and
make
his
paths
straight
;
for
there
standeth
one
among
you
whom
ye
know
not
;
and
he
is
mightier
than
I
,
whose
shoc's
latchet
fam
not
worthy
to
unloose
.
And
much
spake
my
father
concerning
this
thing
,
And
my
father
saith
that
he
should
baptise
in
Bethabara
,
beyond
Jordan
;
and
he
also
spake
,
that
he
should
baptise
with
water
;
yea
,
even
that
he
should
baptise
the
Messiah
with
water
,
And
after
that
he
had
baptised
the
Messiah
with
water
,
he
should
behold
and
hear
record
,
that
he
had
baptised
the
Lamb
of
God
,
which
should
take
away
the
sins
of
the
world
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
my
father
had
spoken
these
words
,
he
spake
unto
my
brethren
concerning
the
Gospel
,
which
should
be
preached
among
the
Jews
;
and
also
,
concerning
the
dwindling
of
the
Jews
in
unbelief
.
And
after
that
they
had
slain
the
Messiah
which
should
come
,
and
after
that
he
had
been
slain
,
he
should
rise
from
the
dead
,
and
should
make
himsclf
manifest
,
by
the
Holy
Ghost
,
unto
the
Gentiles
.
Yea
,
even
my
father
spake
much
concerning
the
Gentiles
,
and
also
concerning
the
House
of
Isracl
:
That
they
should
be
compared
like
unto
an
olive
tree
,
whose
branches
should
be
broken
off
,
and
should
be
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
,
Wherefore
,
he
said
,
it
must
needs
be
that
we
should
[File:027]
pe
led
with
one
accord
,
into
the
land
of
promise
,
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
word
of
the
Lord
:
That
we
should
be
scaitered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
.
And
after
that
the
House
of
Israe
!
should
be
scattered
,
they
should
be
gathered
together
;
or
,
in
fine
,
that
after
the
Gentiles
had
received
the
fulness
of
the
Gospel
,
the
natural
branches
of
the
olive
tree
,
or
the
remmants
of
the
House
of
Israel
,
should
be
grafted
in
,
or
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
true
Messiah
,
their
Lord
and
their
Redeemer
.
And
after
this
manner
of
language
did
my
father
prophesy
and
speak
unto
my
brethren
;
and
also
,
many
more
things
,
which
I
do
not
write
in
this
book
;
for
{
have
written
as
many
of
them
,
as
were
expedient
for
me
,
in
mine
other
book
.
And
all
these
things
of
which
I
have
spoken
,
was
done
,
as
my
father
dwelt
ina
tent
,
in
the
valiey
of
Lemnel
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
afier
I
,
Nephi
,
having
heard
all
the
words
of
my
father
,
concerning
the
things
which
he
saw
in
a
vision
;
and
also
the
things
which
he
spake
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;.
which
power
,
he
received
by
faith
on
Ae
Son
of
God
.
And
the
.
Son
-
of
God
was
the
Messiah
,
whic
!
should
come
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
J
,
Nephi
,
was
desirous
also
,
that
1
might
sce
,
and
hear
,
and
know
of
these
things
,
by
the
power
of
the
Ioly
Ghost
,
which
is
the
gift
of
God
unto
all
those
who
diligently
seek
him
,
as
well
in
timesof
old
as
in
the
time
that
he
should
manifest
himself
unto
the
children
of
men
;
for
he
is
the
same
yesterday
,
to-day
,
and
forever
;
and
the
way
is
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
worldjif
it
so
be
that
they
repent
and
come
unto
him
;
for
he
that
diligently
seeketh
,
shall
find
;
and
the
mysteries
of
God
shall
be
unfolded
unto
them
,
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
as
well
in
these
times
,
as
in
times
of
old
;
and
as
well
in
times
of
old
,
as
in
times
to
come
;
wherefore
,
the
course
of
the
Lord
is
one
eternal
round
.
_
Therefore
,
remember
,
O
man
,
for
all
thy
doings
,
thou
shalt
be
brought
into
judgment
.
Wherefore
,
if
ye
have
sought
to
do
wickedly
in
the
days
of
your
probation
,
then
ye
are
found
unclean
before
the
judgment
scat
of
God
;
and
no
unclean
thing
can
dwell
with
God
;
wherefore
,
ye
must
be
cast
off
forever
.
And
the
Holy
Ghost
giveth
authority
that
I
should
speak
thes
things
,
and
deny
them
not
.
c
_
For
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
had
desired
to
know
the
things
that
my
father
bad
seen
,
and
believing
that
the
Lord
ayas
able
to
make
them
known
unto
me
;
wherefore
,
as
1
#tit
[File:028]
pondering
in
mine
heart
,
Iwas
caught
away
in
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
,
yea
,
into
an
exceeding
high
mountain
,
which
I
never
had
before
seen
,
and
upon
which
I
never
had
hefore
sat
my
foo{
.
And
the
spiritsaith
unto
me
,
Behold
,
what
desirest
thou
?
And
I
saith
,
1
desire
to
behold
the
things
which
my
father
saw
.
And
the
spirit
saith
unto
me
,
Believest
thou
that
thy
father
saw
the
tree
of
which
he
hath
spoken
?
And
I
said
yea
;
thou
Knowest
that
I
believe
all
the
words
of
my
father
.
And
when
I
had
spoken
these
words
,
the
spirit
ericd
with
a
loud
voice
;
saying
:
Hosanna
to
the
Lord
,
the
most
high
God
:
for
he
is
God
over
all
the
earth
,
yea
,
even
above
all
;
and
blessed
art
thou
,
Nephi
,
because
thou
believest
in
the
Son
of
the
Most
High
God
;
wherefore
,
thou
shalt
behold
the
things
which
thou
hast
desired
.
And
behold
,
this
thing
shall
be
giv
en
unto
thee
for
a
sign
:
that
after
thou
hast
beheld
the
tree
which
bore
the
fruit
which
thy
father
tasted
,
thou
shalt
also
behold
a
aman
.
descending
cut
of
Heaven
,
and
him
shall
ye
witness
;
andafier
that
ye
have
witnessed
him
,
ye
shall
bear
rec
at
itis
the
Son
of
God
.
it
came
to
pass
that
the
spirit
saith
unto
me
,
look
!
and
Tlooked
and
beheld
a
tree
;
and
it
was
like
unto
the
tree
which
amy
father
had
seen
;
and
the
beauty
thereof
was
far
beyond
,
yea
,
exceeding
of
all
beauty
;
and
the
whiteness
thereof
,
did
exceed
the
whiteness
of
the
driven
snow
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
that
]
had
scen
the
tree
,
I
said
unto
the
spirit
,
F
behold
thou
bast
shewn
unto
me
the
tree
which
is
precious
above
all
,
And
he
saith

said

to
know
the
interpretation
thereof
;
for
I
spake
unto
him
as
a
man
speaketh
;
for
I
beheld
that
he
was
in
the
form
of
a
man
;

I

knew
that
it
was
the
spirit

with
another
.

And
it
came
to

unto

And
I
looked
as
if
to
look
upon
him
,
and
1
saw
him
not
;
for
he
had
gone
from
before
my
presence
.
And
it
came
to

And

And

And
I

,
a

,
Most

And
he
saith
[File:029]
unto

,
Knowest

And
[said
unto

,
I
know
that

E
do
not

the
meaning
of
all

And
he
said
unto
me
,
Behold

the
virgin

thou
seest
,
is
the
mother
of
God
,
after

And
it
came
to

itself
abroad
in

wherefore
,
it
is
the
most
desirable
above

And
he
spake
unto

Ibcheld
that

,
or
to
the
tree
of

;
which
waters
are
a
representation

God
;
and
L
also

And

And
I
looked

Redeemer
of

,
of
which
my
father
had
spoken
;
and
I
also
beheld
the
prophet
,
which
should
prepare
the
way
before
him
.
And
the
Lamb
of
God
went
forth
,
and
was
baptised
of
him
;
and
after
ihat
he
was
baptised
,
I
beheld

and
abode
upon
him
in
the
form

And

And

And

and
I

And
Mooked

And
Tbcheld
multitudes
of
people
which

And
it

And
I

by
the
people
;
yea
,
the
Everlasting
God
,
was
judged
of
the
world
;
and
saw
and
bear
record
,
And
I
,
Nephi
,
saw
that
he
was
lifted
up
upon
the
cross
,
and
slain
for
the
sins
of
the
world
.
And
after
that
he
was
slain
,
I
saw
the
rouititiudes
of
the
earth
,
that
they
were
gathered
together
to
fight
against
the
apostles
of
the
Lamb
;
for
thus
were
the
twelve
called
by
the
angel
of
the
Lord
.
And
the
multitude
of
the
earth
was
gathered
together
;
and
I
beheld
that
they
were
in
a
large
and
spacious
building
,
like
unto
the
building
which
my
father
saw
.
And
the
angel

saying
,
Behold

behald
,

House
of
Israel

And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
and
bear
record
,
that
the
great
and
spacious
building
was
the
pride
of
the
world
;
and
it
fell
;
and
the
fall
thereof
was
exceeding
great
.
And
the
angel
of
the
Lord
spake
unto
me
again
,
saying
:
Thus

And

And

And
it
came
to

that
I
saw
a
mist
of
darkness
on
the
face
of
the
lund
of
promise
;
and
I
saw
lightnings
,
and
I
heard
thunderings

,
fecause
of
the
quaking
thereof
.
And
it
came
to

that
after
I

I
saw
the
vapor
of
darkness
,
that

5
and

And

saw
the
Heavens

And

saying
:
Behold

And

And
while

humble
themselves
before
the
Lord
;
and
the
power
of
the
Lord
was
with
them
:
and
I
beheld
that
their
mother
Gentiles
was
gathered
together
upon
the
waters
,
and
upon
the
land
also
,
to
battle
against
them
;
and
I
beheld
that
the
power
of
God
was
with
them
;
and
also
,
that
the
wrath
of
God
was
upon
them
,
that
were
gathered
together
against
them
to
battle
.
And
I
,
Nephi
,
beheld
that
the
Gentiles
which
had
gone
out
of
captivity
,
weve
delivered
by
the
power
of
God
,
out
of
the
hands
of
all
other
nations
.
—
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
beheld
that
they
did
prosper
in
the
land
;
and
I
beheld
a
Book
;
and
it
was
carried
forth
among
them
.
And
the
angel
saith
unto
me
,
Knowest
thou
the
meaning
of
the
Book
?
And
[saith
unto
him
,
[know
not
,
And
he
saith
,
Behold
,
it
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
Jew
,
and
I
,
Nephi
,
beheld
it
;
and
he
saith
unto
mey
The
Book
which
thou
beholdest
,
is
a
record
of
the
Jews
,
which
coniains
the
covenants
of
the
Lord
which
he
hath
made
unto
the
House
of
Isvacl
;
and
it
also
containcth
many
of
the
prophecies
of
the
Holy
Prophets
;
and
it
is
a
record
like
unto
the
engravings
which
are
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
saye
there
are
not
so
many
;
[File:034]
nevertheless
,
they
contain
the
covenants
of
the
Lord
,
whic
he
hath
made
unto
the
House
of
Israel
;
wherefore
,
they
a
of
great
worth
unto
the
Gentiles
,
And
the
ungel
of
the
Lerd
said
unto
me
,
Thou
hast
beheld
that
the
Book
proceeded
forth
from
the
mouth
of
a
Jew
;
and
when
it
proceeded
forth
from
the
mouth
of
a
Jew
,
it
contained
the
plainness
of
the
Gospel
of
the
Lord
,
of
whom
the
twelve
apostles
bear
record
;
and
they
bear
record
according
to
the
truth
which
is
in
the
Lamb
of
God
;
wherefore
,
these
things
goforth
from
the
Jews
in
purity
,
unto
the
Gentiles
,
according
to'
the
truth
which
is
in
God
;
and
after
that
they
go
forth
by
the
hand
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
Lamb
,
from
the
Jews
unto
the
Gentiles
;
behold
,
after
this
,
thou
seest
the
foundation
of
a
great
and
abominable
church
,
which
is
the
most
abominable
above
all
other
churches
;
for
behold
,
they
have
taken
away
_
from
the
Gospel
of
the
Lamb
,
many
parts
which
are
plain
and
most
precious
;
and
also
,
many
Covenants
of
the
Lord
have
they
taken
away
;
and
all
this
have
they
done
,
that
they
might
pervert
the
right
ways
of
the
Lord
;
that
they
might
blind
the
eyes
and
harden
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
;
wherefore
,
thou
seest
that
after
the
Book
hath
gone
forth
through
the
hands
of
the
great
and
abominable
church
,
that
there
are
many
plain
and
precious
things
taken
away
from
the
Book
,
which
is
ihe
Book
of
the
Lamb
of
God
;
and
after
that
these
plain
and
precious
things
were
taken
away
,
it
goeth
forth
unto
all
the
nations
of
the
Gentiles
;
and
after
it
goeth
forth
unto
all
the
nations
of
the
Gentiles
,
yea
,
even
across
the
many
waters
which
thou
hast
seen
with
the
Gentiles
which
have
gone
forth
out
of
captivity
;
and
thou
seest
because
of
the
many
plain
and
precious
things
which
have
been
taken
out
of
the
Book
,
which
were
plain
unto
the
understanding
of
the
children
of
men
,
according
to
the
plainness
which
is
in
the
Lamb
of
God
;
and
because
of
these
things
which
are
taken
away
out
of
the
Gospel
of
the
Lamb
,
an
exceeding
great
many
do
stumble
,
yea
,
jusomuch
that
Satan
hath
great
powerover
them
;
nevertheless
thou
behotdest
that
the
Gentiles
which
haye
gone
forth
out
of
captivity
,
and
have
becn
lifted
up
by
the
power
of
God
above
all
other
nations
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
which
is
choice
above
all
other
lands
,
which
is
the
land
which
the
Lord
God
hath
coyenanted
with
thy
father
,
that
his
seed
should
haye
,
for
the
land
of
their
inheritance
;
wherefore
,
thou
seest
that
the
Lord
God
will
not
suffer
thet
the
Gentiles
will
utterly
destroy
the
-
mixture
of
thy
seed
,
whieh
is
among
thy

;
neither
[File:035]
will
he
suffer
that
the
Gentiles
shall
destroy
the
seed
of
thy
brethren
;
neither
will
the
Lord
God
suffer
that
the
Gentiles
shall
forever
remain
in
that
state
of
awful
woundedness
which
thou
beholdest
that
they
arc
in
,
because
of
the
plain
and
most
precious
paris
of
the
Gospel
of
the
Lamb
which
hath
beer
kept
back
by
that
abominable
church
,
whose
formation
thou
hast
seen
;
wherefore
,
saith
the
Lamb
of
God
,
I
will
be
merciful
unto
the
Gentiles
,
unto
the
visiting
of
the
remnant
of
the
House
of
Israel
in
great
judgment
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
of
the
Lord
spake
unto
me
,
saying
:
Behold

wherefore
,
after
that
thave
visited
them
in

,
and
smitten
them
by
the
hand
of
the
Gentiles
;
and
after
that
the
Gentiles
do
stumble
cxceedingly
,
because

And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
the
remnant
of
the

of
my

,
and
also
the
book
of

And
the

saying
:

And

unto

saying
:
Thou

and
thou
also
knowest
concerning

Lord
unto
the
House

;
and
thou
also
hast
heard
,
that
whoso
repenteth

must
perish
;
therefore
,
wo
be
unto
the
Gentiles
,
if
it
so
be
that
they
harden
their

against
the

of

:
for
the
time
cometh
,
saith
the
Lamb
of

,
that
J
will
work
a
great
and
a
marvellous
work
among
the
children
of
men
;
@
worle
which
shall
be
everlasting
,
either
on
the
one
hand
or
on
the
other
;
cither
to
the
convincing
of
them
unto
peace
and
life
eternal
,
or
unto
the
deliverance
of
them
to
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
the
blindness
of
their
minds
,
unto
their
being
brought
down
inte
captivity
,
and
also
unto
destruction
,
both
temporally
and
spiviiually
,
according
to
the
captivity
of
the
Devil
,
of
which
J
have
spoken
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
angel
lad
spoken
these
words
,
he
saith
unto
me
,
Remember
thou
the
covenants
of
the
Father
unto
the
House
of
Israel
?
I
saith
unto
him
,
yea
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
saith
unto
me
,
Look
,
and
behold
that
great
and
abominable
church
,
which
is
the
mother
of
abotinations
,
whose
foundation
is
the
Devil
.
And
he
saith
unto
te
,
Behold
,
there
is
,
save
it
be
,
two
churches
:
the
one
is
the
church
of
the
Lamb
of
God
,
and
the
other
is
the
church
of
the
Devil
;
wherefofe
,
whoso
helongeth
not
to
the
church
of
the
Lamb
of
God
,
belongeth
to
that
great
church
,
which
is
the
mother
of
abominations
;
and
she
is
the
whore
of
all
the
earth
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
looked
and
beheld
the
whore
of
all
the
earth
,
and
she
sat
upon
many
waters
;
and
she
had
doiminion
over
all
the
carth
,
among
all
nations
,
kindreds
,
tongues
,
and
people
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
the
church
of
the
Lamb
of
God
,
and
its
numbers
were
few
,
because
of
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
the
whore
whieh
sat
upon
many
waters
;
neveriheless
,
I
beheld
that
the
church
of
the
Lamb
,
which
were
the
Sprints
of
God
,
were
also
upon
all
the
face
of
the
carth
;
andtheir
dominion
upon
the
face
of
ihe
carth
was
apy
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
great
whore
which
saw
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
that
the
great
mother
of
abominations
did
gather
together
multitudes
upon
the
face
of
[File:038]
the
earth
,
among
all
the
nations
of
the
Gentiles
,
to
fight
agains}
the
Lamb
of
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
1
,
Nephi
,
beheld
the
power
of
the
Laub
of
God
,
that
it
descended
upon
the
saints
of
the
church
of
the
Lamb
,
and
upon
the
covenant
people
of
the
Lord
,
which
were
scattered
upon
all
the
faec
of
the
carth
;
and
they
were
armed
with
righteousness
and
with
the
power
of
God
in
great
glory
.
Abu
it
value
iv
pass
that
I
beheld
that
the
wrath
of
God
was
poured
out
upon
the
great
and
abominable
church
,
insomuch
that
there
were
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
among
all
{he
nations
and
kindreds
of
the
earth
;
and
as
there
began
to
be
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
among
all
the
nations
which
belonged
to
the
mother
of
abominations
,
the
angel
spake
unto
me
,
saying
:
Be
hold
,
the
wrath
of
God
is
upon
the
mothersof
harlots
;
and
,
behold
,
thou
scest
all
these
things
!
And
when
the
day
cometh
that
the
wrath
of
God
is
poured
out
upon
the
mother
of
harlots
,
which
is
the
grcat
and
abominable
church
of
all
the
earth
,
whose
founder
is
the
Devil
,
then
,
at
that
day
,
the
work
of
the
Father
shall
commence
,
in
preparing
the
way
for
the
fulfilling
ef
his
covenants
,
which
he
hath
made
to
his
people
,
which
are
of
the
House
of
Israel

And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
spake
unto
me
,
saying
,
Look
!
And
I
looked
and
beheld
a
man
,
and
he
was
dressed
in
a
white
robe
;
and
the
angel'
said
unto
me
,
Behold
one
of
the
twelve
Apostles
of
the
Lumb
!
Behold
,
he
shall
see
and
write
the
remainder
of
these
things
;
yea
,
4nd
also
many
things
which
have
been
;
and
he
shall
also
wrile
concerning
the
end
of
the
world
;
wherefore
,
the
things
which
he
shall
write
,
are
just
and
true
;
and
,
behold
,
they
are
written
in
the
book
which
thou
beheld
proceeding
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
Jew
;
and
at
the
time
they
proceeded
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
Jew
,
or
,
at
the
time
the
book
proceeded
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
Jew
,
the
things
which
were
written
,
were
plain
and
pure
,
and
most
precious
,
and
easy
to
the
understanding
of
all
men
.
And
,
be
hold
,
the
things
which
this
Apostle
of
the
Lamb
shall
write
,
are
many
things
which
thou
hast
seen
;
and
,
behold
,
the
remainder
shalt
thou
see
;
but
the
things
which
thou
shalt
see
hereafter
,
thou
shalt
not
write
;
forthe
Lord
God
hath
ordained
the
Aposile
of
the
Lamb
of
God
,
that
he
should
write
them
.
And
also
,
others
which
have
been
to
them
,
hath
he
shown
all
_
things
,
and
they
have
written
them
;
and
they
are
scaled
up
,
come
forth
in
their
purity
,
according
to
the
truth
which
=
[File:039]
in
the
Lamb
,
in
the
own
duc
time
of
the
Lord
,
unto
the
House
of
Israel
.

And
I
,
Nephi
,
heard
and
bear
record
,
that
the
name
of
the
Apostle
of
the
Lamb
was
John
,
according
to
the
word
of
the
angel
.
And
,
behold
,
I
,
Nephi
,
am
forbidden
that
I
should
write
the
remainder
of
the
things
which
I
saw
and
heard
;
wherefore
,
the
things
which
I
have
written
,
sufficeth
me
;
and
Thave
not
written
but
a
small
part
of
the
things
which
I
saw
.
And
I
bear
record
,
that
I
saw
the
things
which
my
father
saw
,
and
the
angel
of
the
Lord
did
make
them
known
unto
me
—
And
now
I
make
an
end
of
speaking
concernmg
the
things
which
1
saw
,
while
1
was
carried
away
in
the
spirit
;
and
ifall
ithe
things
which
I
saw
are
not
written
,
the
things
which
I
have
written
,
are
true
.
And
thus
it
is
.
Amen
.
CHAPTER
IV
,
Avo
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
,
Nephi
,
had
been
cayricd
away
in
the
spirit
,
and
seen
all
thesc
things
,
I
returned
to
the
tent
of
my
father
,
And
it
came
to
pass'that
I
beheld
my
brethren
,
and
they
were
disputing
one
with
another
,
concerning
the
things
which
my
father
had
spoken
unto
them
;
for
he
truly
spake
many
great
things
unto
them
,
which
was
hard
to
be
understood
,
save
a
man
should
inquire
of
the
Lord
;
and
they
being
hard
in
their
hearts
,
therefore
they
did
not
look
unto
the
Lord
as
they
had
ought
.
And
now
J
,
Nephi
,
was
grieved
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
,
and
also
,
because
of
the
things
which
Lhad
seen
,
and
knew
they
must
unavoidably
come
to
pass
,
because
of
the
great
wickedness
of
the
children
of
men
.
b
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
was
overcome
because
of
my
afs
flictions
,
for
I]
considered
that
mine
afllictions
were
great
above
all
,
because
of
the
destructions
of
my
people
;
for
Tad
bebeld
their
fall
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
]
had
received
strength
,
I
spake
unto
my
brethren
,
desiring
to
know
of
them
the
cause
of
their
disputations
,
And
they
said
,
Behold
,
we
cannot
understand
the
words
which
our
father
hath
spoken
conceming
the
natural
branches
of
the
olive
tree
,
and
also
,
concerning
the
Gentiles
.
AndI
said
unto
them
,
Have
ye
inquired
of
the
Lord
?
And
they
said
unto
me
,
we
have
not
;
forthe
Lord
maketh
no
[File:040]
such
thing
known
unto
us
.
Behold
,
I
said
unto
them
,
Howjs
it
that
ye
do
not
keep
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
?
How
is
it
that
ye
will
perish
,
because
of
the
hardness
of
your
hearts
?
Do
ye
.
not
remember
the
things
which
the
Lord
hath
said
:
If
ye
will
not
harden
your
hearts
,
and
ask
me
in
faith
,
believing
that
ye
shall
receive
,
with
diligence
in
keeping
my
commandments
,
surely
,
these
things
shall
be
made
known
unto
you
?
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
the
House
of
Israel
was
compared
unto
an
olive
tree
,
by
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
which
was
in
our
fathers
;
and
,
behold
,
are
we
not
broken
off
from
the
House
of
Israel
;
and
are
we
not
a
branch
of
the
House
of
Israel
?
And
now
,
the
thing
which
our
father
meaneth
concer
ning
the
grafting
in
of
the
natural
branches
through
the
fulness
ofthe
Gentiles
,
is
,
that
in
the
latter
days
,
when
our
seed
shall
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
,
yea
,
for
the
space
of
many
years
,
and
many
generations
,
after
that
the
Messiah
hath
manifested
himself
in
body
unto
the
children
of
men
,
then
shall
the
fulness
of
the
Gospel
of
the
Messiah
come
unto
the
Gentiles
,
and
from
the
Gentiles
unto
the
remnant
of
our
seed
;
and
at
that
day
,
shall
the
remnant
of
our
sced
know
that
they
are
of
the
House
of
Israel
,
and
that
they
are
the
covenant
people
of
the
Lord
;
and
then
:
shall
they
know
and
come
to
the
knowledge
of
their
forefathers
,
and
also
to
the
knowledge
of
the
Gospel
of
their
Redeemer
,
which
was
ministered
unio
their
fathers
.
by
him
;
wherefore
,
they
shall
come
to
the
knowledge
of
their
Redee
-
_
mer
,
and
the
very
points
of
his
doctrine
,
that
they
may
know
how
to
come
unto
him
and
be
saved
.
And
then
at
that
day
,
will
they
not
rejoice
and
give
praise
unto
their
everlasting
God
,
their
rock
and
their
salvation
?
Yea
,
at
that
day
,
will
they
not
receive
the
strength
and
nourishment
from
the
gue
yine
?
Yea
,
will
they
not
come
unto
the
true
fold
of
God
?
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
Yea
;
they
shall
be
remembered
again
among
the
House
of
Israel
;
they
sball
be
grafted
in
,
being
a
natural
branch
of
the
olive
tree
,
info
the
true
olive
tree
;
and
this
1s
what
our
father
meaneth
;
and
he
meaneth
that
it
will
not
come
to
pass
,
until
after
that
they
are
scattered
by
the
Gentiles
;
and
he
meaneth
that
it
shall
come
by
way
of
the
Gentiles
,
that
—
the
Lord
may
shew
his
power
unto
the
Gentiles
,
for
the
very
cause
that
he
shall
be
rejected
of
the
Jews
,
or
of
the
House
of
Israel
;
wherefore
,
our
father
hath
.
nzot
spoken
of
our
seed
alone
,
but
also
of
all
the
House
of
Israel
,
pointing
to
the
covenant
which
should
be
fulfilled
in
the
latter
days
;
which
cove
[File:041]
nant
the
Lord
made
to
our
father
Abraham
,
saying
:
In
thy~
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
blessed
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
spake
much
unto
them
concerning
these
things
;
yea
,
I
spake
unto
them
concerning
the
restoration
of
the
Jews
,
in
the
latter
days
;
and
I
did
rehearse
unto
them
the
words
of
Isaiah
,
which
spake
concerning
the
restoration
of
the
Jews
,
or
of
the
House
of
Israel
;
and
after
that
they
were
restored
,
they
should
no
more
be
confounded
,
neither
should
they
be
scattered
agam
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
speak
many
words
unto
my
brethren
,
that
they
were
pacified
,
and
did
humble
themselves
before
the
Lord
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
speak
unto
me
again
,
saying
:
What
meaneth
the
thing
which
our
father
saw
in
a
dream
?
What
meaneth
the
tree
which
he
saw
?
And
I
said
unto
them
,
it
was
a
representation
of
the
tree
of
life
.
And
they
said
unto
me
,
What
meaneth
the
rod
of
iron
which
our
fatlier
saw
,
that
led
to
the
tree
?
And
T
said
unto
them
,
that
it
was
the
word
of
God
;
and
whoso
would
hearken
unto
the
word
of
God
,
and
would
hold
fast
unto
it
,
they
would
nevey
perish
;
neither
could
the
temptations
and
the
firy
darts
of
the
adversary
,
overpower
them
unto
blindness
,
to
lead
them
away
to
destruction
.
Wherefore
,
I
,
Nephi
,
did
exhort
them
to
give
heed
unto
the
word
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
I
did
exhort
them
with
all
the
energies
of
my
soul
,
and
with
all
the
faculty
which
I
possessed
,
that
they
would
give
heed
to
the
word
of
God
,
and
remember
to
keep
-
his
commandments
always
,
in
all
things
,
—
And
they
said
unto
me
,
What
meaneth
the
river
of
water
which
our
father
saw
?
And
I
said
unto
them
,
that
the
water
which
my
father
saw
,
vas
filthiness
;
and
so
much
was
his
mind
swallowed
u
ther
things
,
that
he
beheld
not
the
filthinese
of
the
water
;
Fsaid
unto
them
,
that
it
was
an
awful
gulf
,
which
separatcth
the
wicked
from
the
tree
of
life
,
and
also
from
the
Saints
of
God
;
and
J
said
unto
them
,
that
it
was
a
representation
of
that
awful
Hell
,
which
the
angel
said
unte
me
was
prepared
for
the
wicked
,
And
I
said
unto
them
,
that
our
father
also
saw
,
that
the
justice
of
God
did
also
divide
the
wicked
from
the
righteous
;
and
the
brightness
thereof
was
like
unto
the
brightness
of
a
flaming
fire
,
which
ascendeth
up
unte
God
forever
and
ever
,
and
hath
no
end
,
.
s
And
they
said
unto
me
,
Doth
this
thing
mean
the
torment
the
body
in
the
days
of
probation
,
or
doth
it
mean
the
fin
state
of
the
soul
after
the
death
of
the
temporal
body
?
or
doth
[File:042]
it
speak
of
the
things
which
are
temporal
?
And
it
came
to
pasa
that
[
said
unto
them
,
That
it
was
a
representation
of
things
both
temporal
and
spiritual
;
forthe
day
should
come
that
they
must
be
judged
of
their
works
,
yea
,
even
the
works
which
were
done
by
the
temporal
body
in
their
days
of
probation
;
where
.
fore
,
if
they
should
die
in
their
wickedness
,
they
must
be
cast
off
;
also
as
to
the
things
which
are
spiritual
,
which
are
pertaining
to
righteousness
;
wherefore
,
they
must
be
brought
to
tand
before
God
,
to
be
judged
of
their
works
;
and
if
their
works
have
been
filthiness
,
they
must
needs
be
filthy
;
andif
they
be
filthy
,
it
must
needs
be
that
they
cannot
dwell
in
the
kingdom
of
God
;
if
so
,
Thekingdom
of
God
niust
be
filthy
also
.
But
,
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
The
kingdom
of
God
is
not
.
filthy
,
and
there
cannot
any
unclean
thing
enter
into
the
king
:
dom
of
God
;
wherefore
,
there
must
needs
be
a
place
of
filthiness
prepared
for
that
which
is
filthy
.
And
there
is
a
place
prepared
,
yea
,
even
that
awful
Hell
of
which
I
have
spoken
,
and
the
Devil
is
the
preparator
of
it
;
wherefore
,
the
final
state
of
the
souls
of
men
is
to
dwell
in
the
kingdom
of
God
,
or
to
be
cast
ont
because
of
that
justice
of
which
I
have
spoken
;
wherefore
,
the
wieked
are
rejected
from
the
righteous
,
and
also
from
that
tree
of
life
,
whose
fruit
is
most
precious
and
most
desirable
above
all
other
fruits
;
yea
,
and
it
is
the
greatest
of
all
the
gifts
of
God
.
And
thus
I
spake
unto
my
brethren
.
—
_
Amen
.
CHAPTER
V
.
e
Ann
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
,
Nephi
,
had
made
aw
end
of
speaking
to
my
brethren
,
behold
,
-
they
said
unto
me
,
Thou
hast
declared
unto
us
hard
things
,
more
than
that
which
we
are
able
to
bear
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
said
unto
them
,
That
I
knew
that
{
had
spoken
hard
things
against
the
wicked
,
according
to
the
.
truth
;
and
the
righteous
have
I
justified
,
and
testified
that
wy
should
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
;
wherefore
,
the
guilty
eth
the
truth
to
be
hard
,
for
it
cuttcth
them
to
the
very
centre
.
And
now
,
my
brethren
,
if
ye
were
righteous
,
and
were
willing
to
hearken
to
the
truth
,
and
give
heed
unto
it
,
that
ye
might
walk
uprightly
before
God
,
then
ye
would
not
murmu
because
of
the
truth
,
and
say
thou
speakest
hard
things
against
[File:043]
+
ws
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
exhort
my
brethxen
,
with
all
diligence
,
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
humble
themselves
before
the
Lord
;
insomuch
,
that
I
had
joy
and
great
hopes
of
them
,
that
they
would
walk
inthe
paths
of
righteousness
.
Now
,
all
these
things
were
said
and
done
,
as
my
father
dwelt
in
a
tent
in
the
valley
which
he
called
Lemuel
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
took
one
of
the
daughters
of
Ishmael
to
wife
;
and
also
,
my
brethren
took
of
the
daughters
of
Ishmacl
to
wife
;
and
also
,
Zoram
took
the
eldest
daghter
of
Ishmacl
to
wife
.
And
thus
my
father
had
fulfilled
all
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
,
which
had
been
given
unto
him
.
And
also
,
I
,
Nephi
,
had
been
blessed
of
the
Lord
,
exceedingly
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
Lord
spake
unto
say
father
,
by
night
,
and
commanded
him
,
that
on
the
morrow
,
he
should
take
his
journey
into
the
wilderness
.
And
it
came
4o
pass
that
as
my
father
arose
in
the
morning
,
and
went
forth
io
the
tent
door
,
to
his
great
astonishment
,
he
beheld
upon
the
ground
a
round
bail
,
of
curious
workmanship
;
and
it
was
of
fine
brass
,
And
within
the
ball
were
two
spindles
;
and
the
one
pointed
the
way
whither
we
should
go
into
the
wilderness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
gather
together
whatsoever
things
we
should
carry
into
the
wilderness
,
and
all
the
remainder
of
our
provisions
which
the
Lord
had
given
unto
us
;
and
we
did
take
seed
of
every
kind
,
that
we
might
carry
into
the
wilderness
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
take
our
tents
,
and
depart
into
the
wilderness
,
across
the
river
Laman
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
travelled
for
the
space
of
four
days
,
nearly
2
south
,
southeast
direction
,
and
we
did
pitch
our
tents
again
;
and
we
did
call
the
name
of
the
place
Shazer
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
take
our
bows
and
our
aryows
,
and
go
forth
into
the
wilderness
,
to
slay
food
for
our
families
;
and
after
.
that
we
had
slain
food
for
our
families
,
we
did
return
again
to
our
families
in
the
wilderness
,
to
the
place
of
Shazer
.
And
we
did
go
forth
again
,
in
the
wilderness
,
following
the
same
direction
,
keeping
in
the
most
fertile
parts
of
.
the
wilderness
,
which
was
in
the
borders
near
the
Sea
,
And
it
eame
to
pass
that
we
did
travel
for
the
space
o}
any
days
,
slaying
food
by
the
way
,
with
our
bows
and
our
,
and
our
stones
,
and
our
slings
;
and
we
,
did
follow
the
direc
[File:044]
tions
of
the
ball
,
which
led
us
in
the
more
fertile
parts
of
the
wilderness
.
And
after
that
we
had
travelled
for
the
space
of
many
days
,
we
did
pitch
our
tents
for
the
space
of
atime
,
that
we
might
again
rest
ourselves
and
obtain
food
for
our
families
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
I
,
Nephi
,
went
forth
to
slay
food
,
behold
,
I
did
break
my
bow
,
which
was
made
of
fine
steel
,
and
after
that
I
did
break
my
bow
,
behold
,
my
brethren
were
angry
with
me
,
because
of
the
loss
of
my
bow
,
for
we
did
obtain
no
food
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
return
without
food
to
our
families
.
And
being
much
fatigued
,
because
of
their
journeying
,
they
did
suffer
much
for
the
want
of
food
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Laman
and
Lemuel
,
and
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
did
begin
to
murmur
exceedingly
,
because
of
their
sufferings
and
afilictions
in
the
wilderness
;
and
also
,
my
father
began
to
murmur
azainst
the
Lord
his
God
;
yea
,
and
they
were
'
all
exceeding
sorrowful
,
even
that
they
did
murmur
against
the
Lord
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
ihat
I
,
Nephi
,
having
been
afilicted
with
my
brethren
,
because
of
the
loss
of
my
how
3
and
their
bows
having
lost
their
springs
,
it
began
to
he
exceeding
difficult
,
yea
,
insomuch
,
that
we
could
obtain
no
food
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
1
,
Nephi
,
did
speak
much
unto
my
brethren
,
because
that
they
had
hardened
their
hearts
again
,
even
unto
complaining
against
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
[
,
Nephi
,
did
make
out
of
wood
bow
,
and
out
of
a
straight
stick
,
an
arrow
;
wherefore
,
I
did
arm
myself
with
a
bow
and
an
arrow
,
with
a
sling
,
and
with
stones
.
And]
said
unio
my
father
,
Whither
shall
I
go
,
to
obtain
food
?
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
inquire
of
the
Lord
,
for
they
had
humbled
themselves
because
of
my
word
;
for
I
did
say
many
things
unto
them
in
the
energy
of
my
soul
.
Aid
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
Lord
came
unto
my
father
;
and
he
was
truly
chastened
because
of
his
murmuring
against
the
Lord
,
insomuch
,
that
he
was
brought
down
into
the
depths
of
sorrow
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
Lord
said
unto
him
,
Look
upon
the
ball
,
and
behold
the
things
which
are
written
!
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
beheld
the
things
which
were
written
upon
the
ball
,
he
did
fear
and
tremble
exceedingly
;
and
also
my
brethren
,
and
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
and
our
wives
.
/
And
it
came
to
pass
that
J
,
Nephi
,
beheld
the
pointers
which
were
in
the
ball
,
that
they
did
work
according
to
the
faith
,
and
diligence
,
and
heed
,
which
we
did
give
unto
them
.
—
[File:045]
And
there
was
also
written
upon
them
,
@
new
writing
,
which
was
plain
to
be
read
,
which
did
give
us
understanding
concerning
the
ways
of
the
Lord
;
and
if
was
written
and
changed
from
time
to
time
,
aceording
to
the
faith
and
diligence
which
ave
gave
unto
it
:
And
thus
we
see
,
that
by
small
means
,
the
Lord
can
bring
about
great
thing
:
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
go
forth
up
into
the
top
of
the
mountain
,
according
to
the
directions
which
were
given
upon
the
ball
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
slay
wild
beasts
,
insomuch
,
that
J
did
obtain
food
for
our
families
—
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
return
to
our
tents
,
bearing
the
beasts
which
Thad
slaing
and
now
,
when
they
beheld
that
I
had
obtained
food
,
how
great
was
their
joy
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
humble
themselves
before
the
Lord
,
and
did
give
thanks
unto
his
.
”
:
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
again
take
our
journey
,
travelling
nearly
the
same
course
as
in
the
beginning
;
and
after
that
we
had
travelled
for
the
space
of
many
days
,
we
did
pitch
our
tents
again
,
that
we
might
tarry
for
the
space
of
@
.
time
,
And
it
caine
to
pass
that
Ishmael
died
,
and
was
buried
in
the
place
which
was
called
Nahom
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
daughters
of
Ishmael
did
mourn
exceedingly
,
because
of
the
loss
of
their
father
,
and
because
of
their
afilictions
in
the
wilderness
;
and
they
did
murmur
against
my
father
,
because
:
that
he
had
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
saying
:
Our
father
is
dead'
;
yea
,
and
we
have
wandered
much
in
the
wilderness
,
and
we
have
suffered
much
affliction
,
hunger
,
thirst
,
and
fatigue
;
and
after
all
these
sufferings
,
we
must
perish
in
the
wilderness
with
hunger
.
And
thus
they
did
murmur
against
my
father
,
and
also
against
me
;
and
they
were
desirous
to
return
again
to
Jerusalem
.
And
Laman
saith
unto
Lemuel
,
and
also
unto
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
Behold
,
let
us
slay
our
father
,
and
also
our
brother
Nephi
,
who
hath
taken
it
upon”
lim
to
be
our
ruler
and
our
teacher
,
who
are
his
elder
brethren
,
Now
,
he
saith
that
the
Lord
hath
talked
with
him
,
and
also
,
that
angels
hath
ministered
unto
him
!
But
behold
,
we
know
that
heieth
unto
us
;
and
he
telleth
us
these
things
,
and
he
worketh
many
things
by
his
cunning
arts
,
that
ay
deceive
our
eyes
,
thinking
,
perhaps
,
that
he
may
lead
us
away
inte
some
strange
wilderness
;
and
after
that
he
hathJed
u
:
away
,
he
hath
thought
to
make
himself
a
King
and
aruler
owe
us
,
that
he
may
do
with
us
according
to
his
will
and
pleasure
.
[File:046]
And
after
this
manner
,
did
my
brother
Laman
stir
up
theig
hearts
to
anger
.
>
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
was
with
us
;
yea
,
even
the
voice
of
the
Lord
came
and
did
speak
many
words
unto'
them
,
and
did
chasten
them
exceedingly
;
and
after
that
they
were
chastened
by
the
voice
of
the
Lord
,
they
.
did
turn
away
their
anger
,
and
did
repent
of
their
sins
,
insomuch
,
that
the
Lord
did
bless
us
again
with
food
,
that
we
did
not
perish
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
again
take
our
journey
in
the
wilderness
;
and
we
did
travel
nearly
eastward
,
from
that
time
forth
.
And
we
did
travel
and
wade
through
much
afilic
.
tion
in
the
wilderness
;
and
our
women
did
bear
children
in
the
wilderness
.
And
so
great
were
the
blessings
of
the
Lord
upon
us
,
that
while
we
did
live
upon
raw
meat
in
the
wilderness
,
our
women
did
give
plenty
of
suck
for
their
children
,
and
were
strong
,
yea
,
even
like
unto
the
men
;
and
they
began
to
bear
their
journeyings
without
murmurings
.
And
thus
we
see
thel
the
commandments
of
God
must
be
fulfilled
.
And
if
it
so
be
that
the
children
of
men
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
he
doth
nourish
them
,
and
strengthen
them
,
and
provide
means
whereby
they
can
accomplish
the
thing
which
he
hath
com
manded
them
;
wherefore
,
he
did
provide
means
for
us
while
we
did
sojourn
in
the
wilderness
.
And
we
did
sojourn
for
the
space
of
many
years
,
yea
,
even
cight
years
in
the
wilderness
,
And
we
did
come
to
the
land
which
we
called
Bountiful
,
bes
cause
of
its
much
fruit
,
and
also
,
wild
honey
;
and
all
these
things
were
prepared
of
the
Lord
,
that
we
might
not
perish
.—
And
we
beheld
the
Sea
,
which
we
called
Irreantum
,
which
be
ng
interpreted
,
is
,
many
waters
.
f
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
pitch
our
tents
by
the
sea
shore
;
and
noiwitlstanding
we
had
suffered
many
affhctions
,
and
much
difficulty
,
yea
,
even
so
much
that
we
cannot
wrile
then
all
,
we
were
exceedingly
rejoiced
when
we
came
to
the
seashore
;
and
we
called
the
place
Bountiful
,
because
of
itt
much
fruit
.
i
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
,
Nephi
,
had
been
in
the
land
of
Bountiful
for
the
space
.
of
many
days
,
the
voice
of
the
Lord
,
came
unto
me
,
saying
:
Arisc
,
and
get
thee
into
the
mountain
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
J
arose
and
went
up
into
the
moun
tain
,
and
cried
unto
the
Lord
.
;
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
spake
unto
me
,
seying
:
Thou
shalt
construct
a
ship
,
efter
the
manner
which
sha
~vaew
thee
,
that
I
may
carry
thy
people
across
these
waters
:
[File:047]
And
I
saith
,
Lord
,
whither
shall
f
go
,
that
Imay
find
ore
to
molten
,
that
I
may
make
tools
to
construct
the
ship
,
after
the
manner
which
thou
hast
shewn
unto
me
?
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
told
me
whither
I
should
go
to
find
ore
,
that
1
might
make
tools
.
.
And
it
came
topass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
make
bellowses
wherewith
to
blow
the
fire
,
of
the
skins
of
beasts
;
and
after
that
I
had
made
bellowses
,
that
I
might
have
wherewith
to
blow
the
fire
,
I
did
smite
two
stones
together
,
that
might
make
fire
,
for
the
Lord
had
not
hitherto
suffered
that
we
should
make
much
fire
,
as
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
;
for
he
saith
,
1
will
make
that
thy
food
shall
become
sweet
,
that
ye
cook
it
not
;
and
I
will
also
be
your
light
in
the
wilderness
;
and
I
will
prepare
the
way
before
you
,
if
itso
be
that
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
;
wherefure
,
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
shall
be
led
towards
the
promised
land
;
and
ye
shalt
know
thatit
is
by
me
that
ye
are
led
.
Yea
,
and
the
Lord
said
also
,
that
after
ye
have
arrived
to
the
promised
land
,
ye
shall
know
that
I
,
the
Lord
,
am
God
;
and
that
J
,
the
Lord
,
did
deliver
you
from
destruction
;
yea
,
that
I
did
bring
you
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
;
wherefore
,
1
,
Nephi
,
did
strive
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
,
and
I
did
exhort
my
brethren
to
faithfulness
and
diligence
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
make
tools
of
the
ore
which
I
did
molien
out
of
the
rock
.
And
when
my
brethren
saw
that
I
was
about
to
build
a
ship
,
they
began
to
murmur
against
me
,
saying
;
Our
brother
is
a
fool
,
for
he
thinketh
that
he
ean
build
aship
;
yea
,
and
he
also
thinketh
that
he
can
cross
these
great
waters
.
And
thus
my
brethren
did
complain
against
me
,
and
were
desirous
that
they
might
not
labor
,
for
they
did
not
believe
that
1
could
build
a
ship
;
neither
would
they
believe
that
I
was
instructed
of
the
Lord
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
was
excecding
-
soraowful
,
because
of
the
hardness
of
iheir
hearts
;
and
now
when
they
saw
that
I
began
to
be
sorrowful
,
they
were
glad
in
their
hearts
,
insomuch
,
that
they
did
rejoice
over
me
,
saying
:
We
knew
that
ye
could
not
construct
a
ship
,
for
we
knew
that
ye
were
lacking
in
judgment
;
wherefore
,
thou
canst
not
accom~
plish
so
great
a
work
;
and
thou
art
like
unto
our
father
,
led
~away
by
the
foolish
imaginations
of
his
heart
;
yea
,
he
hath
led
us
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
;
and
we
have
wandered
in
the
wilderness
for
these
many
years
;
and
our
women
have
toiled
,
being
big
with
child
;
and
they
have
borne
children
in
the
:
[File:048]
wilderness
,
and
suffered
all
things
,
save
it
were
death
;
and
would
have
been
better
that
they
had
died
,
before
they
came
out
of
Jerusalem
,
than
to
have
suffered
these
afflictions
.
Be
hold
,
these
many
years
we
have
suffered
in
the
wilderness
which
time
we
might
have
enjoyed
our
possessions
,
and
the
land
of
our
inheritance
;
yea
,
and
we
might
have
been
happy
;
and
we
know
that
the
people
which
were
in
the
land
of
Jernsa
:
jem
,
were
a
righteous
people
;
for
they
kept
the
statutes
and
fhe
judgments
of
the
Lord
,
and
all
his
commandments
,
according
i
the
law
of
Moses
;
wherefore
,
we
know
that
they
are
a
righteous
eople
;
and
our
father
hath
judged
them
,
and
hath
led
us
away
Petnand
we
would
hearken
unto
his
words
;
yea
,
and
owt
brother
is
like
unto
him
.
And
after
this
manner
of
language
did
my
brethren
murmur
and
complain
against
us
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
spake
unto
them
,
saying
?
Do
ye
believe
that
our
fathers
,
which
were
the
children
of
Is
vael
,
would
have
been
led
away
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Egyp
-
'
tiens
,
if
they
had
not
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
the
Lord
Yea
,
do
ye
suppose
that
they
would
have
been
Jed
out
of
bondage
,
if
the
Lord
had
not
commanded
Moses
that
he
should
icad
them
out
of
bondage
?
Now
ye
know
that
the
children
of
Israel
were
in
bondage
;
and
ye
know
that
they
were
laden
with
tasks
,
which
were
grievous
to
be
borne
;
wherefore
,
-
ye
know
that
it
must
needs
be
a
good
thing
for
them
,
that
they
should
be
brought
out
of
bondage
.
Now
ye
know
that
Moses
wes
commanded
of
the
Lord
to
do
that
great
work
;
and
ye
know
that
by
his
word
,
the
waters
of
the
Red
Sea
were
divided
hither
and
thither
,
and
they
passed
through
on
dry
ground
.
But
ye
know
that
the
Egyptians
were
drowned
in
the
Red
Sea
,
which
were
the
armies
of
Pharaoh
;
and
ye
also
know
that
they
were
fed
with
manna
,
in
the
wilderness
;
yea
,
and
ye
also
now
that
Moses
,
by
his
word
,
according
to
the
power
of
God
which
was
in
him
,
smote
the
rock
,
and
there
came
forth
water
,
that
the
children
of
Israel
might
quench
their
thirst
;
and
notwithstanding
they
being
led
,
the
Lord
their
God
,
their
Redeemer
,
going
before
them
,
leading
them
by
day
,
and
giving
light
unto
them
by
night
,
and
doing
all
things
for
them
which
was
expedient
for
man
to
receive
,
they
hardened
their
hearts
,
and
blinded
their
minds
,
and
reviled
against
Moses
and
against
the
true
and
living
Ged
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
according
to
his
word
,
he
did
destroy
them
;
and
according
to
his
word
,
he
did
lead
them
;
and
according
to
his
word
,
he
did
do
all
things
for
them
;
ane&
.
:
[File:049]
there
was
not
any
thing
done
,
save
it
were
by
his
word
.
And
after
they
had
crossed
the
river
Jordan
,
be
did
make
them
mighty
,
unto
the
driving
out
the
children
of
the
land
,
yea
,
unto
the
scattering
them
to
destruction
.
And
now
do
ye
sup~
pose
that
the
children
of
this
land
,
which
were
in
the
land
of
promise
,
which
were
driven
out
by
our
fathers
,
do
ye
suppose
ihat
they
were
righteous
?
Behold
,
}
say
unto
you
,
nay
.
Do
ye
suppose
that
our
fathers
would
have
been
more
choice
than
they
,
if
they
had
been
righteous
?
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
,
behold
,
the
Lord
esteemeth
all
fiesh
in
one
:
He
that
is
righteous
,
is
favored
of
God
.
But
,
behold
,
this
people
had
rejected
every
word
of
God
,
and
they
were
ripe
in
iniquity
;
and
the
fulness
of
the
wrath
of
God
-
was
upon
them
;
and
the
Lord
did
curse
the
land
against
them
,
aud
bless
it
unto
our
fathers
;
yea
,
he
did
curse
it
against
them
unto
their
destruction
;
and
he
did
bless
it
unto
our
fathers
,
unto
their
obtaining
power
over
it
.
Behold
,
the
Lord
hath
created
the
carth
,
that
it
should
be
inhabiled
;
and
he
hath
ereated
his
children
,
that
they
should
possess
if
.
And
he
raiseth
up
a
righteous
nation
,
and
destroyeth
the
nations
of
the
wicked
.
And
he
leadeth
away
the
righteous
into
precious
lands
,
and
the
,
wicked
he
destroycth
,
and
curseth
the
land
unto
them
for
their
sakes
.
He
ruleth
high
in
the
Heavens
,
for
it
is
his
throne
,
and
this
earth
is
his
footstool
,
And
he
loveth
them
which
will
have
him
to
be
their
God
.
Behold
,
he
loved
our
fathers
;
and
he
coyenanted
with
them
,
yea
,
even
Abraham
,
Isaac
,
and
Jacob
;
and
he
remembered
the
covenants
which
he
had
made
;
wherefore
,
he
did
bring
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
,
and
he
did
straighten
them
in
the
wilderness
with
his
rod
,
for
they
hardened
their
hearts
,
even
as
ye
have
;
and
the
Lord
straightened
thei
,
because
of
their
iniquity
.
He
sent
firy
-
flying
serpents
aniong
them
;
and
after
they
were
bitten
,
he
prepared
a
way
,
that
they
might
be
healed
;
and
the
labor
which
they
had
to
perform
,
was
to
Jook
!
and
because
of
the
simpleness
of
the
way
,
or
the
easiness
:
of
it
,
there
were
many
which
perished
.
And
they
did
harden
their
hearts
from
time
to
time
,
and
they
did
revile
against
Moses
,
and
also
against
God
;
nevertheless
,
ye
know
that
they
were
ied
forth
by
his
matehless
power
,
into
the
Jand
of
promise
,—
And
now
,
after
all
these
things
,
the
time
has
come
that
they
have
beconie
wicked
,
yea
,
nearly
unto
ripeness
;
and
I
know
not
but
they
are
at
this
day
about
to
be
destroyed
,
for
I
know
that
the
day
must
surely
come
,
that
they
must
be
destroyed
,
save
.
a
few
only
,
which
shall
be
led
away
into
captivity
;
[File:050]
wherefore
,
the
Lord
commanded
my
father
that
he
should
4
part
into
the
wilderness
;
and
the
Jews
also
sought
to
talk
away
his
life
;
yea
,
and
ye
also
have
sought
to
take
away
hij
life
;
wherefore
,
ye
are
murderers
in
your
hearts
,
and
ye
a
like
unto
they
:
Ye
are
swift
to
do
iniquity
,
but
slow
to
member
the
Lord
your
God
.
Ye
have
seen
an
angel
,
and
spake
unto
you
;
yea
,
ye
have
heard
his
voice
from
time
time
;
and
he
hath
spoken
uuto
you
in
a
still
,
small
voice
,
but
ye
were
past
feeling
,
that
ye
could
not
feel
his
words
;
where
fore
,
he
hath
spoken
unto
you
like
unto
the
voice
of
thunder
,
which
did
cause
the
earth
to
shake
aa
if
it
were
to
divide
asun
der
,
And
ye
also
know
,
that
by
the
power
of
his
Almighty
word
,
he
can
cause
the
earth
that
it
shall
pass
away
;
yea
,
and
ye
know
that
by
his
word
,
he
can
cause
that
rough
places
be
made
smooth
,
and
smooth
places
shall
be
broken
up
.
0
,
then
,
why
is
it
,
that
ye
can
be
so
hard
in
your
hearts
?
Be
hold
,
my
sou
!
js
rent
with
anguish
because
of
you
,
and
my
heart
is
pained
:
I
fear
lest
ye
shall
be
cast
off
forever
.
Be
hold
,
lam
full
of
the
spirit
of
God
,
insomuch
as
if
my
frame
had
no
strength
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
}
had
spoken
these
words
,
they
were
angry
with
me
,
and
were
desirous
to
throw
.
me
into
the
depths
of
the
Sea
;
and
as
they
came
forth
to
lay
their
hands
upon
me
,
I
spake
unto
them
,
saying
:
In
the
name
of
the
Almighty
God
,
I
command
you
that
ye
touch
me
not
,
for
1
am
filled
with
the
power
of
God
,
even
unto
the
consuming
of
my
flesh
;
and
whoso
shall
lay
their
hands
upon
me
,
shall
wither
even
as
a
dried
reed
;
and
he
shall
be
as
nought
before
the
power
of
God
,
for
God
shall
smite
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
saith
unio
them
,
That
they
should
murmur
no
more
against
their
father
;
neither
should
they
withhold
their
labor
from
me
,
for
God
had
commanded
me
that
I
should
build
a
ship
.
And
I
saith
unto
them
,
If
God
had
commanded
me
to
do
all
things
,
could
do
it
.
If
he
should
command
me
thar
J
should
say
unto
this
water
,
Be
thou
earth
,
it
should
be
earth
;
and
if
I
should
say
it
it
would
be
done
.
And
now
,
if
the
Lord
hath
such
great
power
,
and
hath
wrought
so
many
miracles
among
the
chil
dren
of
men
,
how
is
it
that
he
cannot
instruct
me
,
that
Fshould
build
a
ship
?
And
it
came
fo
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
said
many
things
unto
my
brethren
,
insomuch
that
they
were
confounded
,
and
could
not
contend
against
me
;
neither
durst
they
Jay
their
hands
upon
[File:051]
mie
,
hor
touch
me
with
their
fingers
,
even
for
the
space
of
many
days
.
Now
they
durst
not
do
this
,
lest
they
should
wither
before
me
,
so
powerful
was
the
spirit
of
God
;
and
thus
it
had
wrought
upon
them
,
%
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
said
unto
me
,
Stretch
forth
thine
hand
again
unto
thy
brethren
,
and
they
shall
niot
wither
before
thee
;
but
I
will
shock
them
,
saith
the
Lord
;
and
this
will
1
do
,
that
they
-
may
know'that
I
am
the
Jord
their
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
[stretched
forth
my
hand
unto
my
brethren
,
and
they
did
net
wither
before
me
;
but
the
Lord
did
shake
them
,
even
according
to
the
word
which
he
had
spoken
.
And
now
,
they
said
,
We
know
of
a
surety
,
that
the
Lordis
with
.
thee
,
for
we
know
that
it
is
the
power
of
the
Lord
that
hath
shaken
us
.
And
they
fell
down
before
me
,
and
were
ahout
to
worship
me
,
but
T
would
not
suffer
them
,
saying
:
I
am
thy
brother
,
yea
,
even
thy
younger
brother
;
wherefore
,
worship
the
Lord
thy
God
,
and
honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
,
that
thy
days
may
be
long
in
the
land
which
the
Lord
thy
God
shall
give
thee
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
worship
the
Lord
,
and
dic
go
forth
withme
;
and
we
did
work
timbers
of
curious
workmanship
.
And
the
Lord
did
shew
me
from
time
to
time
,
after
what
manner
I
should
work
the
timbers
of
the
ship
.
Now
:
{
,
Nephi
,
did
not
work
the
timbers
after
the
manner
which
was
learned
by
men
,
neither
did
I
build
the
ship
after
the
inanner
of
men
;
but
Idid
build
it
after
the
manner
which
the
Lord
had
shewn
unto
me
;
wherefore
,
it
was
not
after
the
manner
of
men
,
t
And
T
,
Nephi
,
did
go
into
the
mount
oft
,
and
I
did
pray
oft'
a
the
Lord
;
wherefore
,
the
Lord
shewed
unto
me
great
things
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
afler
I
had
finished
the
ship
according
to
the
word
of
the
Lord
,
my
brethren
beheld
that
it
was
good
,
and
that
the
workmanship
thereof
was
exceeding
fine
;
wherefore
,
they
did
humble
themselves
again
before
the
Lord
.
And
it
came
-
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
Lord
canie
unto
my
father
,
that
we
should
avise
and
go
down
into
the
ship
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
,
after
that
we
had
prepared
all
things
,
much
fruits
and
meat
from
the
wilderness
,
and
honey
in
abundance
,
and
provisions
,
according
to
.
that
which
the
hoe
had
commanded
us
,
we
did
go
down
into
-
the
ship
with
all
our
loading
and
our
seeds
,
and
whatsoever
[File:052]
thing
we
had
brought
with
us
,
eyery
one
according
to
his
age
wherefore
,
we
did
all
go
down
into
the
ship
,
with
our
wiy
and
our
children
.
:
:
And
now
,
my
father
bad
begat
two
sons
,
in
the
wilderness
;
The
eldest
was
called
Jacob
,
end
the
younger
,
Jeseph
.
An
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
all
gone
down
into
the
ship
,
and
had
taken
with
us
our
provisions
ani
things
which
ha
been
commanded
us
,
we
did
put
forth
into
the
sea
,
and
we
driven
forth
before
the
wind
,
towards
the
promised
land
;
an
after
that
we
had
been
driven
forth
before
the
wind
,
fer
the
space
of
many
days
,
bebold
,
my
brethren
,
and
the
sons
of
Ish
macl
,
and
also
their
wives
,
began
to
make
themselves
merry
,
_
insomuch
that
they
began
to
dance
,
and
to
sing
,
and
to
speal
with
much
rudeness
,
yea
,
even
to
that
they
did
forget
by
whai
power
they
had
been
brought
thither
;
yea
,
they
were
lifted
up
unto
exceeding
rudeness
,
And
1
,
Nephi
,
began
to
fear
exceedingly
,
lest
the
Lord
should
he
angry
with
us
,
and
smite
us
because
of
our
iniquity
,
that
we
should
be
swallowed
up
i
the
depths
of
the
Sea
;
wherefore
,
1
,
Nephi
,
began
to
speak
to
them
with
much
soberness
;
but
,
behold
,
they
were
ausryl
with
me
,
saying
:
We
will
not
that
our
younger
brother
shall
be
a
ruler
over
us
.
e
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Laman
and
Lemuel
did
take
me
_
and
bind
me
with
cords
,
and
they
did
treat
me
with
much
harshness
;
nevertheless
,
the
Lord
did
suffer
it
,
that
he
might
shew
forth
his
power
,
unto
the
fulfilling
of
his
word
which
he
hath
spoken
,
concerning
the
wicked
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
bound
me
,
insomuch
that
I
could
not
move
,
the
compass
,
which
had
been
prepared
ot
the
Lord
,
did
cease
to
work
;
wherefore
,
they
knew
not
whither
they
should
steer
the
ship
,
insomuch
,
that
there
arose
a
great
storm
,
yea
,
a
great
and
terrible
tempest
;
and
we
were
driven
back
upon
the
waters
for
the
space
of
three
days
;
and
they
began
to
be
frightened
exceedingly
,
lest
they
should
be
drowned
in
the
Sea
;
nevertheless
,
they
did
loose
me
note=
And
on
the
fourth
day
which
we
had
been
driven
back
,
the
tempest
began
to
be
exceeding
sore
.
i
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
were
about
to
be
swallowed
up
jn
the
depths
of
the
Sea
,
And
after
that
we
had
been
driven
back
upon
the
waters
for
the
space
of
four
days
,
my
brethren
began
to
see
that
the
judgment
of
God
was
upon
them
,
and
that
they
must
perish
,
save
that
they
should
repent
of
their
amiguities
;
wherefore
,
they
came
unto
me
and
Joosed
the
bands
[File:053]
avhich
was
upon
my
wrists
,
and
behold
,
they
had
much
swoten
,
exceedingly
;
and
also
,
mine
ancles
were
much
swollen
,
and
great
was
the
soreness
thereof
,
Nevertheless
,
I
did
look
unto
my
God
,
and]
did
praise
him
all
the
day
long
;
and
I
did
not
murmur
against
the
Lord
,
because
of
mine
alilictions
.
Now
,
my
father
,
Lehi
,
had
said
many
things
uato
them
,
and
also
unto
the
sons
of
Ishmael
;
but
,
behold
,
they
did
breathe
out
much
threatnings
against
any
one
that
should
speak
for
me
;
and
my
parents
being
stricken
in
years
,
and
having
suf
fered
much
grief
because
of
their
children
,
they
were
brought
down
,
yea
,
even
upon
their
sick
beds
.
Because
of
their
grief
,
and
much
sorrow
,
and
.
the
iniquity
of
my
brethren
,
they
were
brought
near
even
to
be
carried
out
of
this
time
,
to
mect
their
God
;
yea
,
their
gray
hairs
were
about
to
be
brought
down
to
lie
low
in
the
dust
;
yea
,
cven
they
were
near
to
be
cast
into
a
watery
grave
.
And
Jacob
and
Joseph
also
,
being
young
,
having
need
of
much
nourishment
,
were
gricved
because
of
the
aillictions
of
their
mother
;
and
also
my
wife
,
with
her
tears
and
prayers
,
and
also
my
children
,
did
not
soften
the
hearts
of
my
brethren
,
that
they
would
loose
me
;
and
there
was
nothing
,
save
it
were
the
power
of
God
,
which
threatened
them
with
desiruction
,
could
soften
their
hearts
;
wherefore
,
when
—
they
saw
that
they
were
about
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
,
they
repented
of
the
thing
which
they
had
done
,
insomuch
that
they
loosed
me
.
tn
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
loosed
me
,
behold
,
T_
took
the
compass
,
and
it
did
work
whither
I
desired
it
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
prayed
unto
the
Lord
;
and
after
that
T
tad
prayed
,
the
winds
did
cease
,
and
the
storm
did
cease
,
and
there
was
a
great
calin
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
J
,
Nephi
,
did
guide
the
ship
,
that
we
sailed
again
towards
the
promised
land
.
Andit
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
sailed
for
the
space
of
many
days
,
we
!
did
arrive
to
the
promised
land
;
and
we
went
forth
upon
the
—
Jand
,
and
did
pitch
our
tents
;
and
we
did
call
it
the
promised
land
,
—
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
begin
to
Gl
the
earth
,
end
avg
began
to
plant
seeds
;
yea
,
we
did
put
all
car
seeds
into
the
carth
,
which
we
had
brought
from
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
grow
excecdingly
;
where~
”
ifore
,
we
were
blessed
in
abundance
.
yg
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
find
upon
the
Land
of
Promise
,
as
we
joumied
im
(
he
wilderness
,
that
there
were
beaste
an

and
manner
of

,
which
were
for
the
use

Al
we
did
find
ali
manner
of
ore
,
both
of
gold
,
and
of
silver

of
copper

¥
And
it
came
(
o
pass
that
the
Lord
commanded
me
,
whe
fore
I
did
make
plates
of
ore
,
that
I
might
engraven
upon

the
record
of

And
upon
the

prophecics
of

a
also

many
of

engraven

And
J
knew
not
at
that
time
when
I
made
them
,
t
{
should
be
commanded
of
the
Lord
to
make
these

wherefore

the

the
genealogy
of
fathers

the
more
part
of
all
our
proceedings
inthe
wild
ness
,
are
engraven
upon
those
plates

have
spoke

the

these

are

of

truth

more

And
afier
that
T
had
made
these

plates
by
way
of
coi
mandinent
,
fF
,
Nephi
,
received
a
commandment
,
that
the
mini
try
,
and
the'
prophecies
,
the
more
plain
and
precious
parts
them
,
should
be
written
upon
these
plates
;
and
shat
the
thi
which
were
written
,
should
be
kept
for
the
instruction
of
people
,
which
should
possess
the
land
,
and
also
for
oth
Wisc
purposes
,
which
purposes
,
ure
known
unto
the
Lor
wherefore
,
1
,
Nephi
,
did
make
a
record
upon
the
other
plat
which
gives
an
account
,
or
which
gives
a
greater
account
,
the
wars
,
amd
contentious
,
and
destructions
of
my
people
.
Al
this
have
I
done
,
and
commanded
my
people
that
they
sho
do
,
after
that
I
was
gone
,
aud
that
these
plates
should
be
ded
down
froin
one
generation
to
another
,
or
from
one
prop
to
another
,
until
further
commandments
of
the
Lord
.
And
account
of
my
making
these
plates
shall
be
given
hereaft
and
then
,
behold
,
1
proceed
according
to
that
which
J
h
spoken
;
and
this
}
do
,
that
the
more
sacred
things
may
kept
for
the
knowledge
of
my
people
.
Nevertheless
,
t
do
write
any
thing
upon
plates
,
save
it
be
that
I
think
it
be
ered
.
And
now
,
if
Ido
err
,
even
did
they
err
of
old
.
that
I
would
excuse
myself
beeause
of
other
men
,
but
heea
of
the
weakness
which
is
in
me
,
according
to
the
flesl
would
excuse
myself
.
For
the
things
which
some
men
teem
to
be
of
great
avorth
,
both
to
the
body
and
soul
,
oth
set
at
nonght
,
and
-
trample
under
their
feet
.
Yea
,
even”
[File:055]
very
God
of
Israel
,
do
men
trample
under
their
feet
;
I
say
,
trample
under
their
feet
;
but
T
would
speak
in
other
words
:
They
do
set
him
at
nought
,
and
hearken
not
to
the
voice
of
his
counsels
;
and
behold
,
he
cometh
according
to
the
words
of
the
angel
,
in
six
hundred
years
from
the
time
my
father
left
Jerusalem
.
And
the
world
,
because
of
their
iniquity
,
shall
judge
him
to
bea
thing
of
nought
;
wherefore
,
they
scourge
him
,
and
he
suffereth
it
;
and
they
smite
him
,
and
he
suffereth
at
.
Yea
,
they
spit
upon
him
,
and
he
suffereth
it
,
because
of
his
loying
kindness
and
his
long
suffering
towards
the
children
of
men
.
And
the
God
of
our
fathers
,
which
were
led
out
of
Exypt
,
out
of
bondage
,
and
also
were
preserved
in
the
wilderness
by
him
;
yea
,
the
God
of
Abraham
,
and
of
Isaac
,
and
the
God
of
Jacob
,
yieldeth
himself
according
to
the
words
of
the
angel
,
as
a
man
,
into
the
hands
of
wicked
men
,
to
be
lifted
up
according
to
Ure
words
of
Zenock
,
and
to
be
crucified
,
aceording
to
the
words
of
Neum
,
and
to
be
buried
in
a
sepulchre
,
and
according
to
the
words
of
Zenos
,
which
he
spake
,
concerning
the
three
days
of
darkness
,
which
should
be
a
sign
given
of
his
death
,
unto
them
who
should
inhabit
the
isles
of
the
sea
;
more
especially
given
unto
them
which
are
of
the
House
of
Is
rael
.
For
-
thus
spake
the
Prophet
:
The
Lord
God
surely
shail
visit
all
the
House
of
Israel
at
that
day
:
some
with
his
voice
,
because
of
their
righteousness
,
unto
their
great
joy
and
salvation
;
and
others
,
with
the
thunderings
and
the
lightuings
of
his
power
,
by
tempest
,
by
fire
,
and
by
smoke
,
and
vapour
of
darkness
,
and
by
the
opening
of
the
earth
,
and
by
mountains
which
shall
be
carvied
up
;
and
all
these
things
must
surely
come
,
saith
the
Propket
Zenos
.
And
the
rocks
of
the
.
carth
must
rend
;
and
because
of
the
groanings
of
the
earth
,
many
of
the
Kings
of
the
isles
of
the
sea
shall
be
wrought
upon
by
the
spirit
of
God
,
to
exclaim
,
The
God
of
nature
suffers
.
And
as
for
they
which
are
at
Jerusalem
,
saith
the
prophet
,
shall
be
scourged
by
all
people
,
saith
the
prophet
,
because
they
erucily
the
God
of
Israel
,
and
turned
their
hearts
aside
,
rejecting
signs
,
and
wonders
,
and
power
and
glory
of
the
God
of
Israel
;
and
because
they
turned
their
hearts
aside
,
saith
the
prophet
,
and
have
despised
the
Holy
one
of
Israel
,
they
shall
wander
in
the
flesh
,
and
perish
,
and
become
a
hiss
and
a
byword
,
and
be
hated
among
all
nations
;
nevertheless
,
when
that
day
cometh
,
saith
the
prophet
,
that
they
no
more
turn
aside
their
hearts
against
the
Holy
one
of
Isracl
,
then
will
he
remember
the
covenants
which
he
made
to
their
fathers
;
yea
;!
[File:056]
then
will
he
remember
the
isles
of
the
sea
;
yea
,
and
ail
the
people
which
are
of
the
House
of
Israel
,
will
gather
in
,
saith
—
the
Lord
,
according
to
the
words
of
the
Prophet
Zenos
,
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
;
yea
,
and
all
the
earth
shall
see
the
salvation
of
the
Lord
,
saith
the
prophet
;
every
nation
,
kindred
,
tongue
,
and
people
,
shall
be
blessed
.
And
I
,
Nephi
,
have
written
(
hese
things
unto
my
peaple
,
that
perhaps
J
might
persuade
them
that
they
would
remember
the
Lord
their
Redeemer
;
wherefore
,
I
speak
unto
al
)
the
House
of
Israel
,
if
it
so
be
that
they
should
obtain
these
things
.
For
behold
,
I
have
workings
in
the
spirit
,
which
doth
weary
me
,
even
that
all
my
joints
are
weak
,
for
they
which
are
at
Jerusalem
;
for
had
not
the
Lord
been
mergiful
,
to
shew
unto
me
concerning
them
,
even
as
he
had
prophets
of
old
;
for
he
sure+
ly
did
shew
unto
the
prophets
of
old
,
all
things
concerning
them
;
and
also
,
he
did
shew
unto
many
,
concerning
us
;
wherefore
,
it
must
needs
be
,
that
we
know
concerning
them
,
for
they
are
written
upon
the
plates
of
brass
.
CHAPTER
YI
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
1
,
Nephi
,
did
teach
my
brethren
these
things
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
read
many
things
-
to
them
,
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
that
they
might
know
concerning
the
doings
of
the
Lord
in
other
jands
,
among
people
of
old
.
And
[did
read
many
things
unto
them
,
which
were
written
in
the
Book
of
Moses
;
but
that
i
might
more
fully
persuade
them
to
believe
in
the
Lord
their
Redeemer
,
wherefore
did
read
woto
them
that
which
was
written
by
the
Prophet
Isaiah
;
for
I
did
liken
all
scriptures
unto
us
,
that
it
might
be
for
our
profit
and
learning
.
_
W
hereforc
,
spake
unto
them
,
saying
:
Hear
ye
the
words
of
the
prophet
,
ye
which
are
a
remnant
of
the
House
of
Israel
,
a
branch
of
which
have
been
broken
off
;
hear
ye
the
words
of
the
prophet
,
which
was
written
unto
all
the
House
of
Israel
,
and
liken
it
unto
yourselves
,
that
ye
may
have
hope
as
well
as
your
brethren
,
from
whom
ye
have
been
broken
of
.
For
after
thix
manner
hath
the
prophet
written
:
Tcarken
and
hear
this
,
O
house
of
Jacob
,
whteh
are
called
by
the
name
of
Isrel
,
and
are
come
forth
ontof
the
waters
of
Judah
,
which
swear
by
the
mame
of
the
Lord
,
and
make
mention
of
the
God
[File:057]
of
Israel
;
yet
they
swear
not
in
truth
,
nor
in
righteousness
.
—
Nevertheless
,
they
call
themselves
of
the
Holy
city
,
byt
they
do
not
stay
themselves
upon
the
God
of
Israel
,
which
is
they
Lord
of
hosts
;
yea
,
the
Lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
.
Behold
,
ft
have
declared
the
former
things
from
the
beginning
;
and
they
went
forth
out
of
my
mouth
,
and
1
shewed
them
;
I
did
shew
them
suddenly
.
.
And
I
did
it
because
]
knew
that
thou
art
obstinate
,
and
thy
neck
was
an
iron
sinew
,
and
thy
brow
brass
;
and
I
have
,
even
from
the
beginning
,
declared
to
thee
5
hefore
it
came
to
pass
TE
shewed
them
thee
;
and
T
shewed
them
for
fear
lest
thou
shouldst
.
say
,
Mine
idol
hath
done
,
them
;
and
my
graven
image
,
and
my
molten
image
,
hath
commanded
them
,
Thou
hast
seen
and
heard
all
this
;
and
will
ye
not
declare
them
?
And
that
1
have
shewed
thee
new
things
from
this
time
,
even
hidden
things
,
and
thou
didst
not
know
them
,
They
are
created
now
,
and
not
from
the
beginning
;
even
before
the
day
when
thou
heardest
them
not
,
they
were
declared
unto
thee
,
Jest
thon
shouldst
say
,
Behold
,
I
knew
them
.
-
Yea
,
and
thou
heardest
not
;
yea
,
thou
knewest
not
;
yea
,
from
that
time
,
thine
ear
was
not
opened
:
for
1
knew
that
thou
wouldest
deal
very
treacherously
,
and
wast
called
a
transgressor
from
the
womb
.
Nevertheless
,
for
my
name
sake
will
I
defer
mine
anger
,
and
for
my
praise
will
I
refrain
from
thee
,
that
I
cut
thee
not
off
.
For
,
behold
,
I
have
refined
thee
;
I
have
chosen
thee
in
the
furnace
of
affliction
.
For
mine
own
sake
,
yea
,
for
mine
own
sake
,
will
1
do
this
;
for
I
will
not
suffer
my
name
to
be
polJuted
,
and
I
will
not
give
my
glory
unto
another
.
Hearken
unto
me
,
O
Jacob
and
Isracl
,
my
called
;
for
lam
he
;
and
.
Tam
the
first
,
and
I
am
also
the
last
.
Mine
hand
hath
also
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
,
and
my
right
hand
ath
spanned
the
heavens
:
and
I
called
unto
them
,
and
they
stand
up
together
.
All
ye
,
assemble
yourselves
,
and
hear
;
which
among
them
hath
declared
these
things
unto
them
?
The
Lord
hath
loved
him
:
yea
,
and
he
will
if
his
word
which
he
hath
declared
by
them
;
and
he
will
do
his
pleasure
on
Babylon
,
and
his
arm
shall
come
upon
the
Chaldeans
.
Also
,
saith
the
Lord
:
I
the
Lord
,
yea
,
I
have
spoken
,
yea
,
I
hay
called
him
,
to
declare
[
have
brought
him
;
and
he
shall
mak
dis
way
prosperous
.
;
Come
ye
near
unto
me
:
I
have
not
spoken
in
secret
from
the
beginning
;
from
the
time
that
it
was
declared
,
have
1
spoken
;
and
the
Lord
God
,
and
his
spirit
,
hath
sent
me
.
And
[File:058]
thus
saith
the
Lord
,
thy
Redcemer
,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
>
Thave
,
sent

,
which
teachcth
thee
to
profit
,
which
leadeth
thee
by
the
way
thou
shouldst'
go
,
hath
done
it
.
O
that
thou
hadst
hearkened
to
my
commandments
!
sm
had
thy
peace
been
as
a
river
,
and
thy
righteousness
as
,
the
waves
of
the
sca
;
thy
seed
also
had
been
as
the
sand
;
the
offspring
of
thy
bowels
like
the
gravel
thereof
;
his
name
should
not
have
been
cut
off
nor
destroyed
from
before
me
.
Go
ye
forth
of
Babylon
,
flee
ye
from
the
Chaldeans
,
with
a
voice
of
singing
declare
ye
,
tell
this
,
utter
to
the
end
of
the
earth
;
say
ye
,
The
Lord
hath
redeemed
his
servant
Jacob
.—
And
they
thirsted
not
;
he
led
them
through
the
deserts
:
he
caused
the
waters
to
flow
out
of
the
vock
for
them
:
he
cleayed
the
rock
alsu
,
and
the
waters
gushed
out
.
And
notwithstanding
he
hath
done
all
this
,
and
greater
also
,
There
is
ne
peace
,
saith
the
Lord
,
unto
the
wicked
.
And
again
:
Hearken
,
O
ye
house
of
Israel
,
all
yo
that
are
broken
off
and
are
driven
out
,
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
pastors
of
my
people
;
yea
,
all
ye
that
are
broken
off
,
that
are
scattered
abroad
,
which
are
of
my
people
,
O
house
of
Israel
.
Listen
,
O
isles
,
unto
me
;
and
learken
,
ye
people
,
from
.
far
;
the
Lord
hath
called
me
from
the
womb
:
from
the
bowels
of
my
mother
hath
he
made
mention
of
myname
.
And
he
hath
made
my
mouth
like
a
sharp
sword
;
in
the
shadow
of
his
hand
hath
he
hid
me
,
and
made
mea
polished
shaft
;
in
his
quiver
hath
he
hid
me
;
and
said
unto
me
,
Thou
art
my
servant
,
O
Isracl
,
in
whom
1
will
be
glorified
,
Then
I
said
,
F
have
labored
in
vain
,
have
spent
my
strength
for
nought
,
and
.
in
vain
;
surely
,
my
judgment
is
with
the
Lord
,
and
my
work
with
my
God
.
And
now
,
saith
the
Lord
,
that
formed
me
from
the
womb
that
F
should
be
his
servant
,
to
bring
Jacob
again
to
him
,
Though
Israel
be
not
gathered
,
yct
shall
I
be
glorious
in
the
eyes
of
the
Lord
,
and
my
God
shall
be
my
strength
.
And
he
said
,
It
is
a
light
thing
that
thou
shouldest
be
my
servant
to
raise
up
the
tribes
of
Jacob
,
and
to
restore
the
preserved
of
Israel
:
I
will
also
give
thee
for
a
light
to
the
Gentiles
,
that
thou
mayest
be
my
salvation
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
.
_
—
Thus
saith
the
Lord
,
the
Redeemer
of
Israel
,
his
Holy
One
,
to
him
whom
man
despiseth
,
to
him
whom
the
nations
abhorreth
,
to
servant
of
rulers
,
Kings
shall
see
and
arise
,
princes
also
shall
worship
,
because
of
the
Lord
that
is
faithful
,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
,
In
an
acceptable
time
have
I
heard
thee
,
O
[File:059]
Ssles
of
the
sea
,
and
in
a
day
of
savlation
have
helped
thee
:
and
I
will
preserve
thee
,
and
give
thee
my
servant
for
a
covenatit
of
the
people
,
to
establish
the
earth
,
to
cause
to
inherit
,
the
desolate
heritages
:
that
thou
mayest
say
to
the
prisoners
,
Go
forth
;
to
them
that
sit
ia
darkness
,
Shew
yourselves
.—
They
shall
feed
in
the
ways
,
and
their
pasiures
shall
be
in
all
high
places
.
They
shall
not
hunger
nor
thirst
,
neither
shall
the
heat
nor
the
sun
smite
them
:
for
he
that
hath
merey
on
them
shall
lead
them
,
even
by
the
springs
of
water
shall
he
guide
them
.
And
1
will
make
all
my
mountains
away
,
and
my
highways
shall
be
exalted
.
And
then
,
O
house
of
Isracl
,
behold
,
these
shall
come
from
far
;
and
lo
,
these
from
the
north
and
from
the
west
;
and
these
from
the
land
of
Sinim
.
Sing
,
O
Heavens
;
and
be
joyful
,
O
earth
;
for
the
feet
of
them
which
are
in
the
east
shall
be
established
;
and
brealc
forth
into
singing
,
O
momntains
:
for
they
shall
be
smitien
no
more
:
for
the
Lord
hath
comforted
his
people
,
and
will
have
mercy
upon
his
afflicted
.
But
,
behold
,
Zion
hath
said
,
The
Lord
hath
forsaken
me
,
and
my
Lord
hath
forgotten
me
;
but
he
will
shew
that
he
hath
not
,
Forcau
a
woman
forget
her
sucking
child
,
that
she
should
not
have
compassion
on
the
sow
ofher
womb
?
Yea
,
they
may
forget
,
yet
will
I
not
forget
thee
,
Ohouse
of
Israel
.
Behold
,
{have
graven
thee
upon
the
palms
of
my
hands
;
thy
walls
are
continually
before
me
.
Thy
children
shall
make
haste
against
thy
destroyers
;
and
they
that
made
thee
waste
,
shall
go
forth
of
thee
.
Lift
up
thine
eyes
round
about
,
and
behold
:
ail
these
gather
dhemselvyes
together
,
and
they
shall
come
to
thee
.
And
as
L
live
,
saith
the
Lord
,
thou
shalt
surcly
clothe
thee
with
them
all
,
as
with
an
ornament
,
and
bind
ihem
onreyen
as
a
bride
.
For
thy
waste
and
thy
desolate
places
,
and
the
land
of
thy
destruction
,
shall
even
now
be
too
narrow
by
reason
of
the
inhabitants
;
and
they
that
swallowed
thee
up
,
shall
be
fax
away
.
The
children
which
thou
shalt
have
,
atter
thou
hast
Jost
the
other
,
shall
again
in
thine
ears
say
,
The
.
place
is
too
straight
for
me
:
give
place
to
me
that
I
may
dwell
.
Then
shalt
thou
say
in
thine
heart
,
Who
hath
begotten
me
these
,
seeing
[
have
lost
my
children
,
and
am
desolate

a

xemoving
to

and
who
hath
brought
up
these
?
Behold
,
I
was
left
alone
;
these
,
where
have
they
been
?
Thus
saith
the
Lord
God
,
Behold
,
I
will
lift
up
mine
hand
to
the
Gentiles
,
and
set
up
my
standard
to

and
they

and
thy

carried
upon

.
And
kings
shall
be
thy
nursing

,
and
their
queens

nursing
mothers
:
they
shall
a
down
to
thee
with
their
face
towards
the
earth
,
and
lick
up
the
:
dust
of
thy
fect
;
and
thow
shalt
know
that
Iam
the
Lord
:
for
they
shall
not

For
shall
the
prey

But
thus

the

And

will

See
CHAPTER
Vil
.
AND
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
.
I
,
Nephi
,
after
that
F
_
had
read
these
things
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
my
brethren
eame
unto
me
and
said
unto
me
,
What
meaneth
these
things
which
ye
have
read
?
Behold
,
are
they
to
be
understood
according
to
things
which
are
spiritual
,
which
shall
come
to
pass
according
to
the
spirit
and
not
the
flesh
?
And
J
,
Nephi
,
sayeth
unto
them
,
Behold
,
they
were
made
manifest
unto
the
prophet
,
by
the
voice
of
the
spirit
:
for
by
the
-
spirit
are
all
things
made
known
unto
the
prophet
,
which
shall
come
upon
the
children
of
men
,
according
to
the'flesh
.
Wherefore
,
the
things
of
which
I
have
read
,
are
things
pertaining
to
things
both
temporel
and
spritual
:
for
it
appears
that
the
House
of
Israel
,
sooner
or
later
,
will
be
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
,
and
also
among
all
nations
,
and
before
there
are
many
which
are
already
lost
from
the
knowledge
of
they
which
are
at
Jerusalem
.
Yea
,
the
more
part
of
all
the
tribes
have
been
led
away
;
and
they
are
scattered
to
and
fro
upon
the
isles
of
the
sea
:
and
whither
they
are
,
none
of
us
Inoweth
,
save
that
we
know
that
they
have
been
led
away
.—
And
since
that
they
have
been
Jed
away
,
these
things
have
been
prophesied
converning
them
,
and
also
concerning
all
they
which
shall
hereafter
be
scattered
and
be
confounded
,
because
of
the
floly
One
of
Isracl
:
for
against
him
will
they
harden
their
hearts
;
wherefore
,
they
shall
be
scattered
among
all
nations
;
[File:061]
nnd
shall
be
hated
by
all
men
.
Nevertheless
,
after
that
they
have
been
nursed
by
the
Gentiles
,
and
the
Lord
hath
lifted
up
his
hand
upon
the
Gent
nd
set
them
up
for
a
standard
,
and
their
children
shall
be
car
in
their
arms
,
and
their
daughters
shall
be
carried
upon
their
shoulders
,
behold
,
these
things
of
which
are
spoken
,
are
temporal
:
for
thus
is
the
covenants
of
the
Lord
with
our
fathers
;
and
it
meancth
us
in
the
days
to
come
,
and
also
al}
our
brethren
which
are
of
the
House
of
Israel
.
Andit
meaneth
that
the
time
cometh
thet
after
all
the
House
of
Israel
have
been
seattered
and
confounded
,
that
the
Lord
God
will
raise
upa
mighty
nation
among
the
Gentiles
,
yea
,
even
upon
the
face
of
this
land
;
and
by
them
shall
our
seed
be
scattered
.
And
after
that
our
seed
is
scattered
,
the
Lord
God
will
proceed
to
doa
marvellous
work
among
the
Gentiles
,
which
shall
be
of
yreat
worth
unto
our
seed
;
wherefore
,
it
is
hkened
unto
ihe
being
nourished
by
the
Gentiles
,
and
being
carried
in
their
arms
,
and
upon
their
shoulders
.
And
it
shall
also
be
of
worth
unto
the
Gentiles
;
and
not
only
unto
the
Gentiles
,
but
unto
all
the
House
of
Israel
,
unto
the
making
known
of
the
covenants
of
the
Father
of
Heaven
unto
Abraham
,
saying
,
In
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
blessed
.
And
would
,
my
brethren
,
that
ye
should
know
that
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
cannot
be
blessed
,
unless
he
shall
make
bare
his
_
arm
in
the
eyes
of
the
nations
.
Wherefore
,
the
Lord
God
will
proceed
to
make
bare
his
arm
in
the
eyes
of
ail
the
nations
,
in
bringing
about
his
covenants
and
his
Gospel
,
unto
they
whick
are
of
the
House
of
Irsael
.
Wherefore
,
he
will
bring
them
.
again
out
of
captivity
,
and
they
shall
be
gathered
together
tov
the
lands
of
their
inheritance
;
and
they
shall
be
brought
out
g
of
obscurity
,
and
out
of
darkness
;
and
they
shall
know
that
the
Lord
is
their
Saviour
and
their
Redeemer
,
the
mighty
one
of
Israel
.
And
the
blood
of
that
great
and
abominable
church
,
which
is
the
whore
of
all
the
earth
,
shal]
turn
upon
their
own
heads
:
for
they
shall
war
among
themselves
,
and
the
sword
of
their
own
hands
shall
fall
upon
their
own
heads
,
and
they
shall
be
drunken
with
their
own
blood
.
And
every
nation
which
shall
war
against
thee
,
O
house
of
Israel
,
shall
he
turned
one
against
another
,
and
they
shall
fall
into
the
pit
which
they
digged
to
ensnare
the
people
of
the
Lord
.
And
all
that
fight
against
Zion
,
shall
be
destroyed
.
And
that
great
whore
,
which
hath
perverted
the
right
ways
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
that
great
and
abominaile
church
,
shall
tumble
to
the'
dust
,
snd
great
shall
he
the
fall
of
it
.
For
behold
,
saith
the
prophet
,
that
the
tine
.
[File:062]
ometh
speedily
,
that
Satan
shall
have
no
more
power
ey
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
:
for
the
day
soon
cometh
,
that
all
the
proud
.
and
they
which
do
wickedly
,
shall
be
as
stubble
;
and
the
day
cometh
that
they
must
be
burned
.
For
the
time
soon
cometh
,
that
the
fulness
of
the
wrath
of
God
whall
he
poured
out
upon
all
the
children
of
men
:
for
he
will
—
mot
suffer
that
the
wicked
shall
destroy
the
righteous
.
Wherefore
,
he
will
preserve
the
righteous
by
his
power
,
even
if
it
so
be
that
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
must
come
,
and
the
righteous
;
be
preserved
,
even
unto
the
destruction
of
their
enemies
by
fire
.
Wherefore
,
the
righteous
need
not
fear
:
for
thus
saith
the
—
They
shall
be
saved
,
even
if
it
so
be
as
by
fire
.
Beold
,
my
brethren
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
these
things
must
shortly
come
;
yea
,
even
blood
,
and
fire
,
and
vapor
of
smoke
must
come
;
and
it
must
necds
be
upon
the
face
of
this
earth
;
and
it
cometh
unto
men
aceording
to
the
flesh
,
if
itso
be
that
they
will
harden
their
hearts
against
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
:
tor
behold
,
the
righteous
shall
not
perish
;
for
the
time
surely
must
come
,
that
all
they
which
fight
against
Zion
,
shall
be
cut
off
.
And
the
Lord
will
surely
prepare
a
way
for
his
people
,
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
words
of
Moses
,
which
he
spake
,
saying
:
A
prophet
shall
the
Lord
your
God
raise
up
unto
you
,
like
unto
me
;
him
shall
ye
hear
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
shall
say
unto
you
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
all
they
which
will
not
hear
that
prophet
,
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
ihe
people
.
And
now
I
,
Nephi
,
declare
unto
you
,
that
this
prophet
of
whom
Moses
spake
,
was
the
Holy
Onc
of
Israel
;
wherefore
,
he
shall
execute
judgment
in
righteousness
;
and
-
the
tighteous
need
not
fear
,
for
it
is
they
which
shall
not
be
confounded
.
But
it
is
the
kingdom
of
the
Devil
,
which
shall
be
built
up
among
the
children
of
inen
,
which
kingdom
is
establised
among
them
which
are
in
the
flesh
:
for
the
time
speedily
shall
come
,
that
all
churches
which
are
built
up
to
get
gain
,
and
all
they
which
are
built
up
to
get
power
over
the
flesh
,
and
they
which
are
built
up
to
become
popular
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
,
and
they
which
seek
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
and
the
things
of
the
world
,
and
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
;
yea
,
in
fine
,
all
they
which
belong
to
the
kingdom
of
the
Devil
,
it
is
they
which
need
fear
,
and
tremble
,
and
quake
;
it
is
they
which
must
be
brought
Jow
in
the
dust
;
itis
they
which
must
he
consumed
as
stubble
:
and
this
is
according
to
the
words
ofthe
propliet
.
And
the
time
cometh
speedily
,
that
the
righteous
must
be
ied
up
as
calves
of
the
stall
,
and
the
Holy
One
[File:063]
of
Israel
must
reign
in
dominion
,
end
might
,
and
power
,
and
greatglory
.
And
he
guthereth
his
children
from
the
four
quar
ters
of
the
earth
;
and
he
numbercth
his
sheep
,
and
they
know
him
;
and
there
shall
be
one
fold
and
one
shepherd
;
and
he
shall
feed
his
sheep
,
and
in
him
they
shall
find
pasture
—
And
because
of
the
righteousness
of
his
people
,
Satan
hath
no
power
;
wherefore
,
he
cannot
be
loosed
for
the
space
of
many
years
:
for
he
hath
no
power
over
the
hearts
of
the
people
,
for
they
dwell
in
righteousness
,
and
the
Holy
Onc
of
Israel
reigneth
.
And
now
behold
,
I
,
Nephi
,
say
unto
you
,
that
all
these
things
must
come
,
according
to
the
flesh
.
But
,
behold
,
all
nations
,
kindreds
,
tongues
,
and
people
,
shall
dwell
safely
in
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
if
it
so
be
that
they
will
repent
.
And
now
I
,
Nephi
,
make
an
end
;
for
I
durst
not
speak
fure
ther
as
yet
,
concerning
these
things
.
Wherefore
,
my
brethrea
,
1
would
that
ye
should
consider
that
the
things
which
have
been
written
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
are
true
;
and
they
tesfify
that
a
man
must
be
obedient
to
the
commandments
of
God
.
Wherefore
,
ye
need
not
suppose
that
I
and
my
father
are
the
only
ones
that
have
testified
,
and
also
taught
them
.
Wherefore
,
if
ye
shall
be
obedient
to
the
commandments
,
and
endure
to
the
end
,
ye
shall
be
saved
at
the
last
day
.
And
thus
it
is

THE

BOOK
OF
NEPHL
CHAPTER
1
a
An
account
of
the
death
of
Lehi
.
Nephi's
brethren
rebelletic
against
him
.
The
Lord
warns
Nephi
to
depart
into
the
wilderness
,
&c
.
His
journeying's
in
the
wilderness
,
§c
.
ANp
now
it
came
to
pass
after
I
,
Nephi
,
had
made
an
end
of
teaching
my
brethren
,
our
father
,
Lehi
,
also
spake
many
things
unto
them
:
how
great
things
the
Lord
had
done
for
them
,
in
bringing
them
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
.
And
he
spake
unto
them
concerning
their
rebellions
upon
the
waters
,
and
the
mercies
of
God
in
sparing
their
lives
,
that
they
were
not
swallowed
up
in
the
sea
,
And
he
also
spake
unto
them
concerning
the
land
of
promise
,
which
they
had
obtained
:
how
:
merciful
the
Lord
had
been
ia
warning
us
that
we
should
flee
[File:064]
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
.
For
,
Behold
,
saith
he
,
I
have
seen
a
vision
,
in
the
which
I
know
that
Jerusalem
is
destroy=_
ed
;
and
bad
we
remained
in
Jerusalem
,
we
should
also
have
erished
.
But
,
said
he
,
notwithstanding
our
afflictions
,
we
have
obtained
a
land
of
promise
,
a
lend
which
is
choice
above
all
other
lands
;
a
land
which
the
Lord
God
hath
covenanted
with
me
should
be
a
land
for
the
inheritance
of
my
seed
.
Yea
,
the
Lord
hath
covenanted
this
land
unto
me
,
and
to
my
children
forever
;
and
also
all
they
which
should
be
led
out
of
other
countries
,
by
the
hand
ofthe
Lord
.
Wherefore
,
1
,
Lehi
,
prohesy
according
to
the
workings
of
the
spirit
which
is
in
me
,
that
there
shall
be
none
come
into
this
land
,
save
they
should
be
brought
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
.
Wherefore
,
this
land
is
consecrated
unto
him
whom
he
shall
bring
.
And
if
it
so
be
that
they
shall
serve
him
according
to
the
commandments
which
he
hath
given
,
it
shall
be
a
land
of
liberty
unto
them
;
wherefore
,
they
shall
never
be
brought
down
into
captivity
:
if
so
,
it
shall
be
because
of
iniquity
:
for
if
iniquity
shall
abound
,
carsed
shall
be
the
land
for
their
sakes
;
but
unto
the
righteous
,
it
shall
be
blessed
forever
.
And
behold
,
it
is
wisdom
that
this
Jand
should
be
keptas
yet
from
the
knowledge
of
other
nations
:
for
behold
,
many
nations
would
overrun
the
Jand
,
that
there
would
be
no
place
for
am
inheritance
.
Wherefore
,
I
,
Lehi
,
have
obiained
a
promise
,
that
inasmuch
as
they
which
the
Lord
God
shall
bring
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
shall
keep
his
commandments
,
they
shall
prosper
upon
the
face
of
this
fand
;
aud
they
shall
be
kept
from
all
other
nations
,
that
they
may
possess
this
land
unto
themselves
.
And
if
it
so
be
that
ihey
shall
keep
his
commandments
,
they
shall
be
blessed
upor
the
face
of
this
Jand
,
and
there
shall
be
none
to
molest
them
,
nor
to
take
away
the
land
of
their
inheritance
;
and
they
shall
dwell
safely
forever
.
But
bebold
,
when
the
time
cometh
that
they
shall
dwindle
in
unbelief
,
aficr
that
they
have
received
xo
_
Sreat
blessings
from
the
hand
of
the
Lord
;
having
a
knowledge
of
the
creation
of
the
earth
,
and
all
men
knowing
the
great
and
marvellous
works
of
the
Lord
from
the
creation
of
the
world
;
haying
power
given
them
to
do
all
things
by
faith
;
having
all
the
commandments
from
the
beginning
,
and
having
heen
brought
by
his
infinite
goodness
into
this
precious
land
of
promise
;
behold
,
say
,
if
the
day
shall
come
that
they
will
reject
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
the
true
Messiah
their
Redeemer
and
their
God
,
behold
,
the
judgments
of
him
that
is
just
,
shall
vest
upon
them
;
yea
,
he
will
bring
other
nations
unto
them
,
[File:065]
and
he
will
give
unto
thei
power
,
and
he
will
take
away
from
them
the
lands
of
their
posscssions
;
and
he
will
cause
them
to
be
scattered
and
smitten
.
Yea
,
as
one
generation
passeth
to
another
,
there
shall
be
bloodsheds
and
great
visitations
among
,
them
;
wherelore
,
my
sons
,
I
would
that
ye
would
remember
;
yea
,
would
that
ye
would
hearken
unio
my
words
,
O
that
ye
would
awake
,
awake
froma
deep
sleep
,
yea
,
even
from
the
sleep
of
hell
,
and
shake
off
the
awfal
chains
by
which
ye
are
bound
,
which
ave
the
chains
which
bind
the
children
ot
men
,
that
they
are
carried
away
captive
down
to
the
eternal
gulf
of
misery
and
wo
!
Awake
!
and
arise
from
the
dust
,
and
hear
the
words
of
a
trembling
parent
,
whese
limbs
ye
must
soon
lay
down
in
the
cold
and
silent
grave
,
from
whenec
no
travel
fer
can
return
:
a
few
more
days
,
and
I
go
the
way
of
all
the
earth
.
But
behold
,
the
Lord
lath
redeemed
my
soul
from
hell
:
Phave
beheld
his
glory
,
and
J
am
encirled
about
eternally
:
in
the
arms
of
his
love
.
And
1
desire
that
ye
should
remember
to
observe
the
statutes
and
the
judgments
of
the
Lord
:
behold
,
this
hath
been
the
anxiety
of
my
soul
,
from
the
beginning
.
My
heart
hath
been
weighed
down
with
sorrow
frora
.
time
to
time
:
for
have
feared
,
lest
for
the
hardness
of
your
hearts
,
lest
the
Lord
your
God
should
come
out
in
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
,
upon
you
,
that
ye
be
cut
off
and
destroyed
forever
;
or
,
that
a
cursing
should
come
upon
you
,
for
the
space
of
many
generations
;
and
ye
are
visited
by
sword
,
and
by
famine
,
and
are
hated
,
and
are
led
according
to
the
will
and
captivity
of
the
Devil
.
O
my
sons
,
that
these
things
might
snot
come
upon
you
,
but
that
ye
might
be
a
choice
and
a
favored
people
of
the
Lord
.
But
,
behold
,
his
will
be
done
:
for
this
ways
are
righteousness
forever
;
and
he
hath
said
,
that
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
;
but
inasmuch
as
ye
will
not
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
shall
be
cut
off
(
rom
my
presence
.
And
now
that
my
soul
might
have
joy
in
you
,
aud
ihat
my
heart
might
leave
this
world
with
gladness
because
of
you
;
that
I
might
not
be
prought
down
with
gricf
and
sorrow
to
the
grave
,
arise
from
the
dust
,
my
sons
,
and
be
men
,
and
be
determined

,
and
in
one
licart
united
in
all
things
,
that
ye
may
not
come
down
into
captivity
;
that
ye
may
not
be
cursed
with
sore
cursing
;
and
also
,
that
ye
may
not
incur

displeasure
:
of
a
just'God
upon
you
,
unto
the
destruction
,
yea
,
the
eternal

Awake
,
my
sons
;
put
on
the
armorof
righteousness
.
Shake
off
the
chuins
with
which
.
[File:066]
ye
are
bound
,
and
come
forth
out
of
obscurity
,
and
arise
from
thedust
,
Rehel
no
more
against
your
brother
,
whose
views
have
been
glorious
,
and
who
hath
Kept
the
commandments
from
the
time
that
we
left
Jerusalem
,
and
who
hath
been
an
instrunicnt
in
the
hands
of
God
,
iv
bringing
us
forth
inte
the
land
of
promise
:
for
were
it
not
for
him
,
we
must
have
perished
with
hunger
in
the
wilderness
;
nevertheless
,
ye
sought
to
take
away
his
life
;
yea
,
and
he
hath
suffered
much
sorrow
because
of
you
,
And
J
exceedingly
fear
and
tremble
because
of
you
,
lest
he
shall
suffer
again
:
for
behold
,
ye
have
accused
him
that
he
songht
power
and
authority
over
you
;
but
know
thathe
hath
not
sought
for
power
uor
authority
over
you
;
bat
he
hath
sought
the
glory
of
God
,
and
your
own
etcrnal
welfare
,
And
ye
have
murmured
because
he
hath
been
Flain
unto
you
.
Ye
say
that
he
hath
used
sharpness
;
ye
say
that
he
hath
been
angry
with
you
.
But
behold
,
his
sharpness
was
the
sharpuess
of
the
power
of
the
word
of
God
,
which
was
in
him
;
and
that
which
ye
call
anger
,
was
the
truth
,
according
to
that
which
is
in
God
,
which
le
could
not
constrain
,
manifesting
boldly
concerning
your
iniquities
.
And
it
must
needs
be
that
the
power
of
God
must
be
with
him
,
even
unto
his
commatiding
you
,
that
ye
mustobey
.
But
behold
,
it
was
not
him
,
but
it
was
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
which
was
in
him
,
whieh
opened
kis
mouth
to
utteranee
,
that
he
could
not
shut
it
.
And
now
my
son
Laman
,
and
also
Lemuel
and
Sam
,
and
also
my
sons
which
are
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
behold
,
if
ye
will
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
Nephi
,
ye
shall
not
perish
.
And
if
ye
will
bearken
unto
him
,
[leave
unto
you
.
a
blessing
,
yea
,
ever
my
first
blessing
.
But
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
hin
,
1
take
away
my
first
blessing
,
yea
,
even
my
blessing
,
and
it
shall
rest
upon
him
,
And
now
,
Zorara
,
[speak
unto
you
:
Behold
,
thou
art
the
servant
of
Laban
;
nevertheless
,
thou
hast
been
brought
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
and
I
know
that
thou
art
a
true
friend
unto
my
sou
,
Nephi
,
forever
.
Wherefore
,
because
thou
hast
been
faithful
,
thy
seed
shall
be
blessed
with
his
seed
,
that
they
dwell
in
prosperity
long
upon
the
face
of
this
land
;
and
nothing
,
save
it
shall
he
iniquity
among
them
,
shall
harm
or
disturb
their
prosperity
upon
the
face
of
this
land
forever
.—
Wherefore
,
if
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
,
the
Lord
hath
consecrated
this
land
for
the
security
of
thy
seed
with
the
seed
of
my
son
.
And
now
,
Jacob
,
1
speak
unto
you
:
Thou
art
my
first
born
in
the
days
of
my
tribulation
in
the
wilderness
.
And
behold
,
in
thy
childhood
,
thou
hast
suf
[File:067]
red
afflictions
and
much
sorrow
,
because
of
the
rudeness
of
thy
brethren
.
Nevertheles
,
Jacob
,
my
first
born
in
the
wil
derness
,
thou
knowest
the
greatness
of
God
;
and
he
shell
consecrate
thine
afllictions
for
thy
gain
.
Wherefore
,
thy
soul
shall
be
blessed
,
and
thou
shalt
dwell
safely
with
thy
brother
,
Nephi
;
and
thy
days
shall
be
speut
in
the
service
of
thy
God
—
Wherefure
,
I
know
that
thou
art
reedcemied
,
because
of
the
righteousness
of
thy
Redeemer
:
for
thou
hast
beheld
,
that
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
he
cometh
to
bring
salvation
unto
men
,
And
thou
hast
beheld
in
thy
youth
,
his
glory
;
wherefore
,
{how
art
blessed
even
as
they
unto
whom
he
shall
minister
in
the
flesh
:
for
the
spirit
is
the
same
,
yesterday
,
to-day
,
and
forever
,
And
the
way
is
prepared
from
the
full
of
man
,
and
salvation
is
free
.
And
men
aze
instructed
sufficiently
,
that
they
know
good
from
evil
,
And
the
law
is
given
unto
men
.
And
by
the
law
,
no
flesh
is
justified
;
or
,
by
the
law
,
men
are
cut
off
,
Yea
,
by
the
temporal
law
,
they
were
cut
off
;
and
als
by
the
spiritual
law
,
they
perish
from
that
which
is
good
,
and
become
miserable
forever
.
Wherefore
,
redemption
cometh
in
and
through
the
Holy
Messiah
:
for
he
is
full
of
grace
and
trath
,
Behold
,
be
offereth
himself
a
sacrifice
for
sin
,
to
answer
the
ends
of
the
law
,
unto
all
those
which
haye
a
broken
heart
and
a
contrite
spirit
;
and
unto
none
else
can
the
ends
of
the
law
be
answered
,
Wherefore
,
how
great
the
importance
to
make
these
things
known
unto
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
,
that
they
may
know
that
there
is
no
flesh
that
can
dwell
in
the
presence
of
God
,
save
it
be
through
the
merits
,
and
mercy
,
and
grace
of
the
Holy
Messiah
,
which
layeth
down
his
life
aceording
to
the
flesh
,
and
taketh
it
again
by
the
power
of
the
spirit
,
that
he
may
bring
(
o
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
,
being
the
first
that
should
rise
.
Wherefore
,
he
is
the
first
fruits
unto
God
,
inasmuch
as
he
shall
make
intercession
for
all
the
children
of
men
;
and
they
that
believe
in
him
,
shall
be
saved
.
And
because
of
the
intercession
for
all
,
all
men
cometh
unto
God
;
wherefore
,
they
stand
in
the
presence
of
Him
,
to
be
judged
of
Him
,
according
to
the
truth
and
holines
which
is
in
Him
.
Wherefore
,
the
ends
of
the
law
which
the
Holy
Ono
hath
given
,

ifit

;
whe

,
there
would
have

Wherefore
,
this
thing
must
needs
destroy
the
wisdor
of
God
,
and
his
eternal
purpeses
;
and
alse
,
the

and

of

And
if

shall
say
ther
is
no

ye
shall

If

And

And

for

wherefore
,
all

away
.
i
And
now
,
my
sons
,
I
speak
unto
yon
these
things
,
for
your
profit
and
learning
:
for
ihere
is
a
God
,
and
he
hath
created
all
things
,
both
the
heavens
and
the
earth
,
and
all
things
that
in
them
is
;
both
things
to
act
,
and
things
to
be
acted
upon
;
and
to
bring
about
his
eternal
purposes
in
the
end
of
man
,
after
that
he
had
created
our
first
parents
,
and
the
beasts
of
the
dield
,
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
,
and
in
fine
,
all
things
which
are
created
,
it
must
needs
be
that
there
was
un
opposition
;
even
the
forbidden
fruit
in
opposition
to
the
tree
of
lite
;
the
one
being
sweet
and
the
other
hitter
;
wherefore
,
the
Lord
God
gave
unto
man
,
that
he
should
act
for
himself
,
Wherefore
,
man
could
not
act
for
himsclf
,
save
it
should
be
that
he
were
enticed
by
the
one
or
the
other
.
And
1
,
Lehi
,
according
to
the
things
which
I
have
read
,
must
weeds
suppose
,
that
an
angel
of
God
,
according
to
that
which
—
a#
written
,
had
fallen
from
Heaven
;
wherefore
,
hc
b¥came
a
Devil
,
having
sought
that
which
was
evil
before
God
.
And
Pecause
that
he
had
fallen
from
Heaven
,
and
had
become
miserable
forever
,
he
sought
also
the
misery
of
all
maniind
.—
Wherefore
,
he
.
sayeth
unto
Hye
,
yea
,
even
that
.
old
serpent
,
—
which
is
the
Devil
,
which
is
the
father
of
all
lies
;
wherefore
he
sayeth
,
Partake
of
the
forbidden
fruit
,
and
ye
shall
not
die
,
but
ye
hall
be
as
God
,
knowing
good
and
evil
.
And
afier
that
Adan
and
Eye
had
partaken
of
the
forbidden
fruit
,
they
were
[File:069]
driven
out
from
the
garden
of
Eden
,
to
till
the
earth
.
And
they
have
brought
forth
children
;
yea
,
even
the
family
of
all
the
earth
.
And
the
days
of
the
children
of
men
were
prolonged
,
according
to
the
will
of
God
,
that
they
might
repent
while
in
the
flesh
;
wherefore
,
their
state
became
a
state
of
probation
,
and
their
time
was
lengthened
,
according
to
the
commandments
which
the
Lord
God
gave
unto
the
children
of
men
.
For
he
gave
commandment
that
all
men
must
repent
;
for
he
shewed
unto
all
men
that
they
were
lost
,
because
of
the
transgression
of
their
parents
.
And
now
,
behold
,
if
Adam
had
not
transgressed
,
he
would
not
have
fallen
;
but
he
would
have
remained
in
the
garden
of
Eden
.
And
all
things
which
were
created
,
must
haye
remained
in
the
same
state
which
they
were
,
after
that
they
were
created
;
and
they
must
have
remained
forever
,
and
had
no
end
.
And
they
would
have
had
no
children
;
wherefore
,
they
would
have
remained
in
a
state
of
innoeence
,
having
no
joy
,
for
they
,
knew
no
misery
:
doing
no
good
,
for
they
knew
no
sin
.
But
,
behold
,
all
things
have
been
done
in
the
wisdom
of
Him
who
knoweth
all
things
.
Adam
fell
,
that
men
might
be
;
and
men
are
,
that
they
might
have
jey
.
And
the
Messiah
cometh
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
that
he
might
redeem
the
children
of
men
from
the
fal}
.
And
because
that
they
are
redeemed
from
the
fall
,
they
have
become
free
forever
,
knowing
good
from
evil
;
to
act
for
themselves
,
and
not
to
be
acted
upon
,
save
it
be
by
the
punishment
of
the
law
,
at
the
great
and
last
day
,
according
to
the
commandments
which
God
hath
given
.
Wherefore
,
men
are
free
according
tothe
flesh
;
and
all
things
are
given
them
which
is
expedient
unto
man
.
And
they
are
free
to
choose
liberty
and
eternal
life
,
through
the
great
mediation
of
all
men
,
or
to
choose
captivity
and
death
,
according
to
the
captivity
and
power
of
the
Devil
:
for
he
seeketh
that
all
men
might
be
miserable
like
unto
himself
.
And
now
,
my
sons
,
I
would
that
ye
should
look
to
the
great
mediator
,
and
hearken
unto
his
great
commandments
;
and
be
faithful
unto
his
words
,
and
choose
eternal
life
,
according
to
the
will
of
his
Holy
Spirit
,
and
not
choose
eternal
death
,
according
to
the
will
of
the
flesh
and
the
evil
which
is
therein
,
which
giveth
the
spirit
of
the
Devil
power
to
captivate
,
to
bring
ya
down
to
hell
,
that
he
may
reign
over

may

for

For
behold

thou
art
the
fruit
of
my

;
and
1am
a
descendant
of
Joseph
,
which
was
carried
cuptive
into
Egypt
.
And
great
was
the
covenants
of
the
Lord
,
which
he
made
unto
Joseph
;
wherefore
,
Joseph
truly
saw
ow
day
.
And
he
obtained
a
promise
ofthe
Lord
,
that
out
of
ihe
fruit
ef
his
loins
,
the
Lord
Ged
would
raise
up
a
righteous
branch
unto
the
House
of
Israel
;
not
the
Messiah
,
but
a
bratich
which
wes
to
be
broken
off
;
nevertheless
,
to
be
re
menibered
in
the
covenants
of
the
Lord
,
that
the
Messiah
should
be
niade
manifest
unto

in

in

spirit

unto

um

;
yea
,
out
of

darkness
and
out

For
Jeseph
truly
testified
,
saying
:
A

shall
the
Lord
my
God
raise
up
,
whieh
shall
be
a
choice
seer
unto

Yea
,
Joseph
truly
said
,
thus
saith
the
Lend

me
:
A

scer
will
raise

out
of

And
unto

1
give
commandment
,
that
he
shall
do
a
work
for
the

of

which
shall
be
of

even
to
the
bringing

.
And
I
will
give
unto
him
a
commandment
,
that
he
shail
do
none

work
,
save
the
work
which
I

And
Moses
will
I
raise
up
,
to

thy
people
out
of

land
of
Egypt
.
But
a
seer
will
I
raise
up
out
of
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
;
and
unto
him
will
I
give
power
to
bring
forth
my
word
unto
the
seed
of
thy
loins
;
and
not
to
the
bringing
forth
my
word
only
,
saith
the
Lord
,
but
to
the
convincing
them
of
my
word
,
which
shall
have
already
gone
forth
among
them
.
Wherefore
,
the
fruit
of
my
loins
shall
write
;
and
the
fruit
of
the
loins
of
Judah
shall
write
;
and
that
which
shall
be
written
by
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
,
and
also
that
which
shall
be
writien
by
the
fruit
of
the
loins
of
Judah
,
shall
grow
together
,
unto
the
confounding
of
false
doctrines
,
and
laying
down
of
contentions
,
and
establishing
peace
among
the
fruit
of
tly
loins
,
and
bringing
them
to'the
knowledge
of
their
fathers
in
the
latter
days
;
and
also
to

of

my

unto
the
restoring

O
house
of

saith
the
Lord
.
And
thus
prophesied
Joseph
,
saying
:
Behold
,
that
seer
,
will
the
Lord
bless
;
and
they
that
seek
to
destroy
him
,
shall
be
confounded
:
for
this

,
ef
which
I
baye
obtained
of

,
of

,
shall
be

.
Behold
,
Tam
sure
of
the
fulfilling
of
this
promise
.
And
his
name
shall
be
culled
afier
me
;
and
it
shall
be
after
the
name
of
his
father
.
And
he
shall
be
like
unto
me
;
for
the
thing
which
the
Lord
shall
bring
forth
by
his
hand
,
by
the
power
of
the
Lord
shall
bring
my
people
unto
salvation
;
yea
,
thus
prophesied
Joseph
.
J
am
sure
of
this
thing
,
even
as
I
am
sure
of
the
promise
of
Moscs
:
for
the
Lord
hath
said
unto
me
,
will
preserve
thy
seed
forever
.
And
the
Lord
hath
said
,
Twill
raise
up
a
Moses
;
and
I
will
give
power
unto
him
ina
rod
;
and
Twill
give
judgment
unto
him
in
writing
,
Yet
I
will
not
loose
his
tongue
,
that
be
shall
speak
much
:
for
I
will
not
make
him
mighty
in
speaking
,
But
I
will
write
unto
him
my
law
,
by
the
finger
of
mine
own
jend
;
and
I
will
make
&
spokesman
for
him
,
And
the
Lord
said
unto
me
also
,
I
will
raise
up
unto
the
fruit
of
thy
Joins
;
and]
will
make
for
him
a
spokesman
,
And
J
,
behold
,
I
will
give
unto
him
,
that
be
shall
write
the
writing
of
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
,
unto
the
fruit
of
thy
Joma
;
and
the
spokesman
of
thy
loins
shall
declare
it
,
And
the
words
which
be
shail
write
,
shal]
be
the
words
which
is
expedient
in
my
wisdom
,
should
go
forth
unto
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
.
And
it
shal]
be
as
if
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
had
cried
mto
them
from
the
dust
;
for
I
know
their
faith
And
they
shall
[File:072]
cry
from
the
dust
;
yea
,
even
repentance
unto
their
brethren
,
even
that
afler
many
generations
have
gone
by
them
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
their
ery
shall
go
,
even
according
to
the
simpleness
of
their
words
.
Because
of
their
faith
,
their
words
shall
proceed
forth
out
of
my
mouth
unto
their
brethren
,
which
are
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
;
and
the
weakness
of
their
words
will
I
make
strong
in
their
faith
,
unto
the
remembering
of
my
covenant
which
made
unto
thy
fathers
.
And
now
,
behold
,
my
son
Joseph
,
after
this
manner
did
my
father
of
old
prophesy
.
Wherefore
,
because
of
this
covenant
,
thou
art
blessed
:
for
thy
seed
shall
not
be
destroyed
,
for
they
shall
hearken
unto
the
words
af
the
Book
.
And
there
shall
raise
ap
ones
mighty
among
them
,
which
shall
do
much
good
,
both
iq
7ord
and
in
deed
,
being
an
instrument
in

hands
of
God

wih

hearken

i
CHAPTER
IIL
.
Anp
now
,
I
,
Nephi
,
speak
concerning
the
prophecies
of
which
my
father
lath
spoken
,
concerning
Joseph
,
who
was
carried
into
Egypt
:
For
behold
,
he
truly
prophesied
concer
ning
all
his
seed
.
And
the
prophecies
which
he
wrote
,
ther
are
not
many
greater
,
And
he
prophesied
concerning
us
,
and
our
future
generations
;
and
they
are
written
upon
the
plate
of
brass
.
Wherefore
,
after
my
father
had
made
an
end
al
speaking
conccrning
the
prophecies
of
Joseph
,
he
called
the
children
of
Laman
,
his
sons
,
and
his
daughters
,
and
sayeth
.
unto
them
,
Behold
,
my
sons
,
and
my
daughters
,
which
are
the
sons
and
the
daughters
of
my
first
born
,
J
would
that
ye
shoule
give
car
unto
my
words
:
for
the
Lord
God
hath
said
,
That
imasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
shall
pros
per
in
the
land
;
and
inasmuch
as
ye
will
not
keep
my
com>
mandments
,
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
my
presence
.
But
behold
,
my
sons
and
my
daughters
,
1
cannot
go
down
to
my
[File:073]
grave
,
save
I
should
leave
a
blessing
upon
you
:
For
behold
,
iknow
that
if
ye
are
brought
up
in
the
night
way
that
ye
should
go
,
ye
will
not
depart
from
it
.
Wherefore
,
if
ye
are
cursed
,
behold
,
IT
teave
my
blessing
upon
you
,
that
the
cursing
may
be
taken
from
you
,
and
be
answered
upon
the
heads
of
your
parents
.
Wherefore
,
because
of
my
blessing
,
the
Lord
God
will
not
suffer
that
ye
shall
perish
;
wherefore
,
he
will
be
merciful
unto
you
,
and
unto
your
seed
,
forever
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
my
father
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
to
the
sons
and
daughters
of
Laman
,
he
caused
the
sons
and
daughters
of
Lemuel
to
be
brought
before
him
.
And
he
spake
unto
them
,
saying
:
Behold
,
my
sons
and
my
daughters
,
which
are
the
sons
and
the
daughters
of
my
secend
son
;
behold
,
1
leave
unto
you
the
same
blessing
which
T=
ft
unto
the
sons
and
daughters
of
Laman
;
wherefore
,
thou
shalt
not
utterly
be
destroyed
;
but
in
the
end
,
thy
seed
shall
be
blessed
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
them
,
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
he
spake
unto
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
yea
,
and
even
all
his
household
.
And
after
that
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
them
,
he
spake
unto
Sam
,
saying
:
Blessed
art
thou
,
and
thy
seed
:
for
thou
shalt
inherit
the
Jand
,
like
unto
thy
brother
,
Nephi
.
And
thy
seed
shall
be
numbered
with
his
sced
;
and
thou
shalt
be
even
like
unto
thy
brother
,
and
thy
secd
like
unto
his
seed
;
and
thou
shalt
be
blessed
in
all
thy
days
.
And
if
came
to
pass
that
after
Lehi
had
spake
unto
all
his
household
,
according
to
the
feelings
of
his
heart
,
and
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
which
was
in
him
,
he
waxed
old
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
died
,
and
was
buried
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
not
many
days
after
his
death
,
Laman
and
Lemuel
,
and
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
were
angry
with
me
,
beeause
of
the
admonitions
of
the
Lord
:
for
I
,
Nephi
,
was
constrained
to
speak
unto
them
,
according
to
the
word
.
Vor
Thad
spake
many
things
unto
them
,
and
also
my
father
,
before
his
death
;
many
of
which
sayings
,
are
written
upon
mine
other
plates
;
for
a
more
history
part
are
written
upon
mine
other
plates
.
And
upon
these
,
I
write
the
things
of
my
soul
,
and
many
of
the
Scriptures
which
are
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
:
For
my

deliteth

and
my

because

And
when
I

to

my

groaneth
because

;
nevertheless

in

My
God
hath
been

he
hath

me
through
mine
afflictions
in

ness
;
and
he
hath
preserved
me
upon
the
waters
of
the
great
deep
.
He
hath
filled
me
with
his
love
,
even
unto
the
consuming
of
my

,
He
hath
confounded

unto
the

Behold

by

I
waxed

him
;
yea
,
my
voice
have
I
sent
upon

;
and
angels
came
down
and
ministered
unto
me
.
And
upon
the

of
his

hath
my

been
carried
away
upon
exceeding
high

,
And
mine
eyes
hath

great
things

great
for

CHAPTER
IV
.
Benop
,
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
ery
much
unto
the
Lord
my
God
,
because
of
the
anger
of
my
brethren
.
But
behold
,
their
anger
did
increase
against
me
,
insomuch
that
they
did
seek
to
take
away
my
life
.
Yea
,
they
did
murmur
against
me
,
saying
:
Our
younger
brother
thinketh
to
rule
over
us
3
and
we
have
had
muck
:
trial
because
of
him
;
wherefore
,
now
let
us
slay
him
,
that
we
may
not
be
afllicted
more
because
of
his
words
.
For
behold
,
we
will
not
that
he
shall
be
our
,
raler
:
for
it
belongeth
unto
us
,
which
are
the
elder
brethren
,
to
rule
over
this
people
.
Now
I
do
not
write
upon
these
plates
,
all
the
words
which
they
murmured
against
me
.
But
it
sufficeth
me
to
say
,
that
they
did
seek
to
take
away
my
life
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
warn
me
,
that
I
,
Nephi
,
should
depart
from
them
,
and
flee
into
the
wilderness
,
and
all
they
which
would
go
with
me
.
Wherefore
,
it
came
to
pass
that
1
,
Nephi
,
did
take
my
family
,
and
also
Zoram
and
his
family
,
and
Sam
,
mine
elder
brother
,
and
his
family
,
and
Jacob
and
Joseph
,
my
younger
brethren
,
and
also
my
sisters
,
and
all
they
which
would
go
with
me
.
And
all
they
which
would
go
with
me
,
were
they
which
believed
in
the
warnings
and
the
revelations
of
God
;
wherefore
,
they
did
hearken
unto
1
my
words
,
And
we
did
take
our
tents
and
whatsoever
things
were
possible
for
us
,
and
did
journey
in
the
wilderness
for
the
[File:076]
space
of
many
days
.
And
after
that
we
had
jouraied
for
the
space
of
many
days
,
we
did
pitch
our
tents
.
And
my
people
would
that
we
should
call
the
name
of
the
place
Nephi
;
where
.
fore
,
we
did
call
it
Neph'
And
all
they
which
were
with
ine
,
did
take
it
upon
them
to
call
themselves
the
people
of
Nephi
,
And
we
did
observe
to
keep
the
judgments
,
and
the
statutes
,
and
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
,
in
all
things
,
according
to
the
law
of
Moses
.
And
the
Lord
was
with
us
;
and
we
did
prosper
exceedingly
;
for
we
did
sow
seed
,
and
we
did
reap
again
inabundance
.
And
we
began
to
raise
flocks
,
and
herds
,
and
animals
of
every
kind
.
And
T
,
Nephi
,
had
also
brought
the
records
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
;
and
also
the
ball
,
or
compass
,
which
was
prepared
for
my
father
,
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
avcording
to
that
whieh
is
written
.
j
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
began
to
prosper
exceedingly
,
~
and
to
multiply
in
the
land
.
And
J
,
Nephi
,
did
take
the
sword
of
Laban
,
and
after
the
manner
of
it
did
make
many
swords
,
lest
by
any
means
the
people
which
were
now
called
Lamanites
,
should
core
upon
us
and
destroy
us
:
for
I
knew
their
hatred
towards
me
and
my
children
,
and
they
which
were
called
my
people
.
And
I
did
teach
my
people
,
that
they
should
build
buildings
;
and
that
they
should
work
in
all
man
-
_
ner
of
wood
,
and
of
iron
,
and
of
copper
,
and
of
brass
,
and
of
steel
,
and
of
gold
,
and
of
silver
,
and
of
precious
ores
,
whick
were
in
great
abundance
.
And
1
,
Nephi
,
did
build
a
temple
;
and
I
did
construct
it
after
the
manner
of
the
temple
of
Solo
-
_
mon
,
save
it
were
not
built
of
so
many
precious
things
:
for
they
were
not
to
be
found
upon
the
land
;
wherefore
,
it
.
could
r
?
a
not
be
built
like
unto
Solomon's
temple
.
Bui
the
manner
of
_
the
construction
was
like
unto
the
temple
of
Solomon
;
and
the
workmanship
thereof
was
exceeding
fine
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
cause
my
people
that
they
should
be
industrious
,
and
that
they
should
labor
with
theirhands
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
would
that
{
should
he
their
King
.
But
I
,
Nephi
,
was
desirons
that
they
should
have
no
King
;
nevertheless
,
I
did
do
for
them
according
to
that
which
was
in
my
power
.
And
behold
,
the
words
of
the
Lord
had
been
fiulfilled
unto
my
brethren
,
which
he
spake
concerning
them
,
that
I
should
he
their
ruler
and
their
teacher
;
wherefore
,
I
had
been
their
ruler
and
their
teacher
,
aecording
to
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
,
uniil
the
time
that
they
sought
to
take
away
my
life
.
Whorefore
,
the
word
of
the
[File:077]
Lord
was
fulfilled
which
he
spake
unto
me
,
saying
:
That
inasmuch
as
they
will
not
hearken
unto
thy
words
,
they
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
.
And
behold
,
they
were
cut
off
from
his
presence
.
And
he
had
caused
the
cursing
to
come
upon
them
,
yea
,
even
a
sore
cursing
,
because
of
their
iniquity
.
For
behold
,
they
had
hardened
their
hearts
against
,
him
,
that
they
had
become
like
unto
a
flint
;
wherefore
,
'as
they
were
white
,
and
exceeding
fair
and
delightsome
,
that
they
might
not
be
enticing
unto
my
people
,
therefore
the
Lord
God
did
cause
a
skin
of
blackness
to
come
upon
them
.
And
thus
saith
the
Lord
God
,
I
will
cause
that
they
shall
be
loathsome
unto
thy
people
,
save
they
shall
repent
of
their
iniquities
..
And
cursed
shall
be
the
seed
of
him
that
mixeth
with
their
seed
:
for
they
shall
be
cursed
even
with
the
same
cursing
.
And
the
Lord
spake
it
,
and
it
was
done
.
And
because
of
their
cursing
which
was
upon
them
,
they
did
become
an
idle
people
,
full
of
mischief
and
subtlety
,
and
did
seek
in
the
wilderness
for
beasts
of
prey
.
And
the
Lord
God
said
unto
me
,
they
shall
be
a
scourge
unto
thy
seed
,
to
stir
them
up
in
re~
membrance
of
me
;
and
inasmuch
as
they
will
not
remember
me
,
and
hearken
unto
my
words
,
they
shall
scourge
them
even
unto
destruction
.
And
it
eame
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
consecrate
Jacob
and
Joseph
,
that
they
should
be
priests
and
teachers
over
the
land
of
my
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
lived
after
the
manner
of
happiness
.
And
thirty
years
had
passed
away
from
the
time
we
left
Jerusalem
.
And
J
,
Nephi
,
had
kept
the
psarnge
upon
my
plates
,
which
Thad
made
of
my
people
thus
ar
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
God
said
unto
me
,
Make
other
plates

thou
shalt
engraven
many
things
upon
them
which
are
good
in
my
sight

for
the

Wherefore

I

Nephi

to

obedient

went

made
these
plates

I
engravened
that

they
must
scarch

to
say

that

r
t
Tun
words
of
Jacob
,
the
brother
of
Nephi
,
which
he
spake
unto
the
people
of
Nephi
:
Behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
that
4
,
Jacob
,
having
been
-
called
of
God
,
and
ordained
after
the
manner
of
his
holy
order
,
and
having
been
conscerated
by
my
brother
,
Nephi
,
unto
whom
ye
look
asa
king
or
a
protector
,
and
on
whom
ye
depend
for
safety
,
behold
,
ye
know
that
have
spoken
unto
you
exceeding
many
things
;
nevertheless
,
speak
unto
you
again
:
for]
am
desirous
for
the
welfare
of
your
souls
.
Yea
,
mine
anxiety
is
groat
for
you
;
and
ye
your
selves
know
that
it
ever
has
been
,
For
I
have
exhorted
you
with
all
diligence
;
and
Ihave
taught
you
the
words
of
my
fa
ther
;
and
have
spoken
unto
you
concerning
all
things
which
are
written
from
the
creation
of
the
world
,
4
i
And
now
,
behold
,
would
speak
unto
you
concerning
things
which
are
,
and
which
are
to
come
;
wherefore
,
I
will
read
you
the
words
of
Isaiah
.
And
they
are
the
words
which
my
broth
er
hath
desired
me
that
I
should
speak
unto
you
.
.
And
I
speak
them
wito
you
for
your
sakes
,
that
ye
may
learn
and
glorify
the
name
of
your
God
,
And
now
,
the
words
which
I
shall
read
,
are
they
which
Isaiah
spake
concerning
all
the
House
of
Is
vael
;
wherefore
;
they
may
be
likened
unto
you
:
for
ye
are
of
the
House
of
Israel
.
And
there
are
many
things
which
have
been
spoken
by
Isaiah
,
which
may
be
likened
unto
you
,
bes
cause
that
ye
are
of
the
House
of
Israel
.
al
And
now
,
these
are
the
words
:
Thus
saith
the
Lord
God
:
Behold
,
1
will
lift
up
mine
hand
to
the
Gentiles
,
and
sct
up
my
standard
to
the
people
;
and
they
shall
bring
thy
sons
in
their
arms
,
and
thy
daughters
shall
be
carried
upon
their
shoulders
,
And
kings
shall
be
thy
nursing
fathers
,
and
their
queens
thy
nursing
mothers
:
they
shall
bow
down
to
thee
with
their
far
_
ces
towards
the
earth
,
and
lick
up
the
dust
of
thy
feet
;
and
thou
shalt
know
that
Tam
the
Lord
:
for
they
shall
not
be
ashamed
that
wait
for
me
.
j
Andnow
[
,
Jacob
,
would
speak
somewhat
concerning
these
words
:
For
behold
,
the
Lord
hath
shewn
me
that
they
which
were
at
Jerusalem
,
from
whence
we
came
,
have
been
slain
;
and
carried
away
captive
;
nevertheless
,
the
Lord
hath
shewn
unto
me
that
they
should
return
again
.
And
he
also
hath
.
shewn
unto
me
,
that
the
Lord
God
,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
should
manifest
himself
unto
them
in
the
flesh
;
and
after
that”
he
should
manifest
himself
,
they
should
scourge
him
and
ert
[File:079]
eify
Lim
,
according
to
the
words
of
the
angel
,
which
spake
it
unio
me
.
And
after
that
they
have
hardened
their
hearts
and
etiiened
their
necks
against
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
behold
,
the
judgments
of
the
Ifoly
One
of
Israel
shall
come
upon
them
.
And
the
day
cometh
that
they
shall
be
smitien
and
af
flicted
.
Wherefove
,
after
they
are
driven
te
and
fro
,
for
thus
saith
the
angel
,
many
shall
be
afllicted
in
the
flesh
and
shall
noi
be
sufered
to
perish
,
because
of
the
prayers
of
the
faithful
:
wherefore
,
they
shall
be
scattered
,
and
smitten
,
and
hated
5
nevertheless
,
the
Lord
will
be
merciful
unto
them
,
that
when
they
shall
come
to
the
knowledge
of
their
Redeemer
,
they
shall
be
gathered
together
again
to
the
lands
of
their
jnheritance
.
ie
And
blessed
are
the
Gentiles
,
they
of
whom
the
prophet
hath
written
:
for
behold
,
if
it
so
be
that
they
shall
repent
and
fight
not
against
Zion
,
and
do
not
unite
themselves
to
that
great
and
abommable
church
,
they
shall
be
saved
:
for
the
Lord
God
will
full
his
covenants
which
he
hath
made
unto
his
children
;
and
for
this
cause
,
the
prophet
hath
written
tbese
things
.
Wherefore
,
they
that
fight
against
Zion
and
the
covenant
people
of
the
Lord
,
shall
lick
up
the
dust
of
their
feet
;
and
the
people
of
the
Lord
shall
not
be
ashamed
.
For
the
people
of
the
Lord
are
they
which
wait
for
him
:
for
they
still
wait
for
the
coming
of
the
Messiah
.
And
behold
,
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophet
,
the
Messiah
will
set
himself
again
the
second
time
,
to
recover
them
;
wherefore
,
he
will
manifest
himself
unto
them
in
power
and
great
glory
,
unto
the
destruction
of
their
enemies
,
when
that
day
cometh
when
they
shall
believe
in
him
;
and
none
will
he
destroy
that
believeth
in
him
.
And
they
that
believe
not
in
him
,
shall
be
destroyed
,
both
by
fire
,
and
by
tempest
,
and
by
earthquakes
,
and
by
bloodsheds
,
and
by
pestilence
,
and
by
famine
.
And
they
shall
know
that
the
Lord
is
God
,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
:
for
shall
the
prey
be
taken
from
the
mighty
,
or
the
Jawful
captive
delivered
?
But
thus
saith
the
Lord
:
Even
the
captives
of
the
mighty
shall
be
taken
away
,
and
the
prey
of
the
terrible
shall
he
delivered
:
for
the
Mighty
God
shall
deliver
his
covenant
people
.
or
thus
saith
the
Lord
:
I
will
contend
with
them
that
contendeth
with
thee
,
and
I
will
feed
them
that
oppress
thee
,
with
their
own
flesh
;
and
they
shall
he
drunken
with
their
own
blood
,
as
with
swect
wine
;
and
all
flesh
shall
know
that
I
the
Lord
am
thy
Saviour
and
thy
Redeemer
,
the
Mighty
One
of
Jacob
.
Yea
,
for
thus
saith
the
Lord
:
Have
I
put
thee
away
,
or
haye
E
[File:080]
cast
thee
off

For
thus
saith
the
Lord
:
Where

of

mother's
divorcement
?
To
whom
have
I
put

,
or
to
which
of
my
creditors
have
I
sold
you
?
Yea
,
iy

Behold
,
for
your
iniquities

je
sold

for

when

O

which
hast
drunk
at

These

thy

And

;
that
he
hath
covenanted
with
all
the
House
of
Israel
;
that
he
hath
spoken
unto
the
Jews
,
by
the
mouth
of
his
holy
prophets
,
even
from
the
beginning
down
,
from
generation
to
gencration
,
until
.
the
time
cometh
that
they
shall
be
restored
to
the
true
Church
and
fold
of
God
;
when
they
shall
be
gathered
home
to
the
lands
of
their
inheritance
,
and
shall
be
established
in
all
their
Jands
of
promise
.
Behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
f
speak
unto
you
these
things
that
ye
may
rejoice
,
and
lift
up
your
heads
forever
,
because
of
the
blessings
which
the
Lord
God
shall
bestow
upon
your
children
.
For
I
know
that
thou
hast
searched
much
,
many
of
you
,
to
know
ofthis
fo
come
;
wherefore
I
know
that
ye
know
that
our
flesh
must
waste
away
and
die
;
nevertheless
,
it
our
bodies
,
we
shall
see
God
,
Yea
,
and
1
know
that

know
,
thatin
the
body
he
shall
shew
himself
unto
they
at
Jeresalem
,
from
whence
we
came
;
for
itis
expedient
that
it
.
shouldbe
among
them
;
for
it
bchoveth
the
Great
Creator
that
he
sufereth
himself
to
become
subject
unto
man
,
in
the
flesh
,
and
die
for
all
men
,
that
all
men
might
become
subject
unto
him
:
For
as
death
hath
passed
upon
all
mea
,
to
fulfil
the
merciful
plan
of
the
Great
Creator
,
there
must
needs
be
a
power
of
resurrection
,
and
the
resurrection
must
needs
come
unto
man
by
reason
of
the
fall
;
and
the
fall
came
by
reason
of
ansgression
;
and
because
man
becaine
fallen
,
they
were
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
Toord
;
wherefore
it
must
needs
be
an
imfinite
atonement
;
save
it
should
be
an
infinite
atonement
,
this
corruption
could
not
put
on
incorruption
.
Wherefore
,
the
firet
judgment
which
came
upon
man
,
must
needs
have
remained
to
an
endless
duration
.
And
if
so
,
this
fleshmust
have
laid
down
to
rot
and
to
crumble
to
its
mother
earth
,
10
rise
no
more
.
O
the
wisdom
of
God
!
his
mercy
and
grace
!
For
behold
,
if
the
fesh
should
rise
no
more
,
our
spirits
must
become
subject
to
that
Angel
which
fell
from
before
the
presence
of
the
Rternal
God
,
and
became
the
Devil
,
to
rise
no
more
.
And
our
spirits
must
have
become
like
unto
him
,
and
we
become
Devils
,
Angels
to
a
Devil
,
to
be
shut
out
from
the
presence
of
our
God
,
and
to
remain
with
the
father
of
lies
,
in
misery
,
like
unto
himself
;
yea
,
to
that
being
who
beguiled
our
frst
parents
;
who
transformeth
himself
nigh
unto
an
angel
of
light
,
and
stirreth
up
the
children
of
men
unto
secret
combinations
of
murder
,
and
all
msnner
of
secret
works
of
darkness
.
O
how
great
the
goodness
of
our
God
,
who
prepareth
a
way
for
our
escape
from
the
grasp
of
this
awful
monster
;
yea
,
that
monster
,
death
and
hell
,
which
I
call
the
death
of
the
body
,
and
also
the
death
of
the
spirit
.
And
because
of
the
way
of
deliverance
of
our
God
,
the
Holy
One
of
fsrael
,
this
death
,
of
which
1
have
spoken
,
which
is
the
temporal
,
shall
deliver
up
its
dead
;
which
death
is
the
grave
.
And
this
death
of
which
I
have
spoken
,
which
is
the
spiritual
death
,
shall
deliver
up
its
dead
;
which
spiritual
death
is
hell
;
wherefore
,
death
and
hell
must
deliver
up
its
dead
,
and
hell
must
deliver
up
its
captive
spirits
,
and
the
grave
must
deliver
up
its
captive
bodies
,
and
the
bodies
and
the
spirits
OF

will
he
restored

ene
to

and
itis
by
the
power
of
the
resurrection
of
the

.
[File:084]
O
how
great
the
plan
of

!
For
on

,
the

of

must
deliver
up
the

and
the

end
the

the

,
and
al]
men

,
and
they
are
living

having
a
perfect

like
unto

in

save
it
be
that
our

wherefore
,
we

And
it

that
when

insomuch
as

as

for

wherefore

they

are
the
Devil

and
they

go

O

and

have
gone
forth
out

But
,
behold

the
right
cous
,
the
saints
of
the
Holy

of

,
they
which
have
believed
in
the
Holy

of

;
they
which
have
endured
_
the
crosses
of
the
world
,
and
despised
the
shame
of
it
;
they
shall
inherit
the
Kingdom
of

,
which
was
prepared
for
them
from
the
foundation
of
the

;
and
their
joy
shall
be

O
the
greatness
of
the
mercy
of
our
God
,
the
Holy
One
of

!
For
he
delivereth'
his
sain{s
from
that
awful
monster
,
the
Devil
,
and
death
and
hell
,
and
that
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
,
which
is
endless
torment
.
O
how
great
the
holiness
of
onr
God
!
For
he
knoweth
all
things
,
and
there
is
not
any
thing
,
save
he
know
it
.
And
he
cometh
into
the
svorld
that
he
may
save
all
men
,
if
they
will
hearken
unto
his
voice
:
for
behold
,
he
suffereth
the
pains
ofall
men
;
yea
,
the
pains
of
every
living
creature
,
both
men
[File:085]
svomen
and
children
,
which
belong
to
the
family
of
Adam

And
he
suiereth
this
,
that
the
resurrection
might
pass
upon
all
men
,
that
all
night
stand
before
him
,
at
the
great
and
judgment
day
,
And
he
commandeth
all
men
that
they
must
repent
,
and
be
baptised
in
his
name
,
having
perfect
faith
in
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
or
they
cannot
be
saved
in
the
Kingdom
of

.
And
if
they
will
not
repent
and
believe
in
his
name
,
and
be
baptised
in
his
name
,
and
endure
to
the
end
,
they
must
be
dumned
;
for
the
Lord
God
,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
hath
spoken
it
;
wherefore
he
hath
given
a
law
;
and
where
there
is
no
law
given
,
there
is
no
punishment
;
and
where
there
is
no
punishinent
,
there
is
no
condemnation
;
and
where
there
is
no
condemuation
,
the
mercies
of
the
Holy
One
of
Isract
hath
claim
upon
them
,
because
of
the
atonement
:
for
they
are
delivered
by
the
power
of
him
:
for
the
atonement
satisfieth
the
demands
of
his
justice
upon
all
those
who
have
not
the
law
given
to
them
,
that
they
are
delivered
from
that
awful
monster
,
death
and
hell
,
and
the
Devil
,
and
the
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
,
which
is
endless
torment
;
and
they
are
restored
to
that
God
who
fave
them
breath
,
which
is
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
.
,
.
But
wo
onto
him
that
hath
the
law
given
;
yea
,
that
hath
all
the
commandments
of
God
,
like
unto
us
,
and
that
transgresseth
them
,
and
that
wasteth
the
days
of
his
probation
:
for
awful
is
his
state
!
t
O
that
cunning
plan
of
the
evil
one
!
O
the
vainness
,
and
the
frailties
,
and
the
foolishness
of
men
!
When
they
are
learned
,
they
think
they
are
wise
,
and
they
hearken
not
unto
the
counsel
of
God
,
for
they
set
it
aside
,
supposing
they
know
of
themselves
.
Wherefore
,
their
wisdom
is
foolishness
,
and
it
profiteth
them'
not
.
Wherefore
they
shall
perish
.
But
to
be
learned
is
good
,
if
it
yo
be
that
they
hearken
unto
the
counsels
of
God
.
But
wo
unto
the
rich
,
which
are
rich
as
to
the
things
of
the
world
.
For
because
that
they
are
rich
,
they
despise
the
poor
,
and
they
persecute
the
meek
,
and
their
hearts
are
upon
their
treasures
;
wherefore
their
treasure
is
dheir
God
.
And
behold
,
their
treasure
shall
perish
with
them
also
,
And
wo
unto
the
deaf
,
that
will
not
hear
:
forthey
shall
perish
.
Wo
unto
the
blind
,
that
will
not
see
:
for
they
shall
perish
also
,
Wo
unto
the
uncircuncised
of
heart
:
for
a
knowledge
of
their
iniquities
shall
smite
them
at
the
Jast
day
.
Wo
unto
the

:
for
he
shall
be
thrust
down
to

.
Wo
unto
the

,
who

for

[File:086]
Wo
unto

:
for

Yea
,
wo
unto

that

for

And

QO

O

I
know
that
the

O

come
unto

Remember

Beholt
,
the
way
for
man
is
narrow
,
but
it
lieth
in
a
straight
course
be
fore
him
,
and
the
keeper
of
the
gate
is
the
Holy

:
and
he
employeth
no

there
;
and
there
is
none
othe

save
it

for

for

because
of
their

and
their

yea
,
they
are
they
,
whom

;
and
save
they
shall
cast
these
things
away
,
and
consider
then
:
selves
fools
before
God
,
and
come
down
in
the
depths

But
the
things
of

O

my
words
:
Behold

that

wherefore
,
ye
shall
know
at
the
last

day
,
when
ail
men
shall
be
,
judged
ol
their
works
,
that
the
God
of
Israel
did
witness
that
T
shook
your
iniquities
from

,
and
that
[
stand
with
brightnes
before

,
and
am
rid
of
your
blood
.
OQ
my
beloved
brethren
,
turn
away
from
your
sins
;
shake
off
the
chains
of
him
that
would
bind
you
fast
;
come
uni
that
God
which
is
the
rock
of
your
salvation
.
Prepare
yout
souls
for
thet
glorious
day
,
when
justice
shall
be
administerel
[File:087]
wato
the
sighteous
;
even
the
day
of
judgment
,
that
ye
may
not
shrink
with
awful
fear
;
that
ye
may
not
remember
your
awful
guilt
in
perfectness
,
and
be
constrained
to
exclaim
,
Loly
,
holy
ave
thy
judgments
,
O
lord
God
Almighty
.
But
I
know
my
guilt
;
1
transgressed
thy
law
,
and
my
transgressions
are
mine
;
and
the
Devil
hath
obtained
ie
,
that
I
am
a
prey
to
his
awful
misery
.
But
behold
,
my
brethren
,
is
it
expedient
that
1
should
awake
you
to
an
awful
reality
of
these
things
?
Would
T
harrow
up
your
souls
,
if
your
minds
were
pure
?
Would
£
be
plain
unto
you
according
to
the
plainness
of
the
truth
,
if
ye
were
freed
fromsin
?
Behold
,
if
ye
were
holy
,
}
would
speak
unto
you
of
holiness
;
but
as
ye
are
not
holy
,
and
ye
look
upon
me
as
a
teacher
,
it
must
needs
be
expedient
that
I
teach
you
the
consequences
of
sin
.
Behold
,
my
soul
abborreth
sin
,
and
my
heart
delighteth
in
righteousness
;
and
I
will
praise
the
holy
name
of
my
God
.
Come
,
my

,
cvery
one
that
thirsteth
,
come
ye
to
the
waters
;
and
he
that
hath
no
money
,
come
buy
and
eat
;
yea
,
come
buy
wine
and
milk
without
money
and
without
price
.
Wherefore
,
do
not
spend
money
for
that
which
is
of
no
worth
,
nor
your
labor
for
that
which
cannot
satisfy
,
Hearken
diligently
unto
me
,
and
remember
the
words
which
I
have
spoken
;
and
come
unto
the
Holy
Onc
of
Israel
,
and
feast
upon
that
which
perisheth
not
,
neitherean
be
corrupted
,
and
let
your
soul
delight
in
fatness
,
Behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
remember
the

of
your
God

pray
unto
him
continually
by

Let
your
hearts
rejoice

and
behold
how
great
the
covenants
of
the
Lord
,
and
how
great
his
condescensions
unto
the
children
of
men
;
and
because
of
his
greatness
;
and
his
grace
and
merey
,
he
hath
promised
unto
us
that
our
seed
shall
not
utterly
be
destroyed
,
according
to
the
flesh
,
but
that
he
would
preserve
them
;
and
in
future
generations
,
they
shall
become
a
righteous
branch
unto
the
House
of
Israel
.

And
now
,
my
brethren
,
{
would
speak
unto
you
more
;

on
the
morrow
I
will
declare
unto
you
the
remainder

CHAPTER
VII

Ayn
now
J
,
Jacob
,
speak
unto
you
again
,
my
beloved
bretiren
,
concerning
this
righteous
branch
of
which
I
have
spoken
.
[File:088]
For
behold
,
the
promises
which
we
have
obtained
,
are
promi
.
ses
unto
us
according
to
the
flesh
;
wherefore
,
as
it
hath
been
shown
unto
me
that
many
of
our
children
shall
perish
in
the
flesh
,
because
of
unbelief
,
nevertheless
,
God
will
be
mereifi
unto
many
;
and
our
children
shall
be
restored
,
that
they
may
come
to
that
which
will
give
them
the
true
knowledge
of
ther
Redeemer
.
Wherefore
,
as
I
said
unto
you
,
it
must
needs
he
expedient
that
Christ
,
(
for
in
the
last
night
the
Angel
spake
vato
me
that
this
should
be
his
name
,)
should
come
among
the
Jews
,
among
they
which
are
the
more
wicked
part
of
the
world
;
and
they
shall
crucify
him
:
For
thus
it
behooveth
our
God
;
and
there
is
none
other
nation
on
carth
that
would
crucify
their
God
,
For
should
the
mighty
miracles
be
wrought
among
other
nations
,
they
would
repent
,
and
know
that
he
be
theiriod
;
but
because
of
priest
-
crafts
and
iniquities
,
theyat
Jerusalem
will
stiffen
their
necks
against
him
,
that
he
be
era
ecified
.
Wherefore
,
because
of
their
iniquities
,
destruetions
,
famines
,
pestilences
,
and
bloodsheds
,
shall
come
upon
them
;
and
they
which
shall
not
be
destroyed
,
shall
be
scattered
among
all
nations
,
But
behold
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
God
:
When
the
day
com
eth
that
they
shall
believe
iu
ine
,
that
1
am
Christ
,
then
have
T
covenanted
with
their
fathers
that
they
shall
be
restored
in
the
flesh
,
upon
fhe
earth
,
unto
the
lands
of
their
inleriiance
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
they
shall
be
gathered
in
from
their
long
dispersion
,
from
the
isles
of
the
sea
,
and
from
the
four
parts
of
the
earth
;
and
the
nations
of
the
Gentiles
shall
be
great
in
the
eyes
of
me
,
saith
God
,
in
carrying
them
forth
1
the
lands
of
their
inheritance
.
Yea
,
the
kings
of
the
Gen
tiles
shall
be
nursing
fathers
unto
them
,
and
their
queens
shall
become
unrsing
mothers
;
wherefore
,
the
promises
of
the
Lord
are
great
unto
the
Gentiles
:
for
he
hath
spoken
it
,
and
who
cau
dispute
.
But
behold
,
This
land
,
saith
God
,
shall
be
a
land
of
thine
inheritance
;
and
the
Gentiles
shall
be
blessed
upon
the
land
.
And
this
land
shall
be
a
Jand
of
liberty
unto
the
Goatiles
;
and
there
shall
be
no
kings
upon
the
land
,
whieh
shall
raise
up
unto
the
Gentiles
,
And
I
will
fortify
this
Jand
against
all
other
nations
;
and
he
that
fighleth
against
Zion
,
shall
perish
,
saith
God
:
for
he
that
raiseth
up
a
king
agains

me
,
shall
perish
.
For
1
the
Lord
,
the
King
of
Heaven
,
will
be
their
king
;
and
I
will
be
a
light
unto
them
forever
,
that
hear
my
words
.
Wherefore
,
for
this
cause
,
that
my
covenants
may
be
fulfilled
,
which
Ihave
made
unto
the
children
of
men
,
that

F
must
needs
destroy
the
secret
works
of
darkness
,
and
of
murders
,
and
of
abominations
;
wherefore
,
he
that
fighteth
against
Zion
,
both
Jew
and
Gentile
,
both
bond
and
free
,
both
male
and
female
,
shall
perish
:
for
they
are
they
which
are
the
whore
of
ell
the
earth
;
forthey
which
are
not
for
me
,
are
against
me
,
saith
our
God
.
For
i
will
fulfil
my
promises
which
I
have
made
ante
the
children
of
men
,
that
I
will
do
unto
them
while
they
are
in
the
flesh
.
Wherefore
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
thus
saith
our
God
:
I
will
afflict
thy
seed
by
the
hand
of
the
Gentiles
;
ne+
yertheless
,
I
will
soften
the
hearts
of
the
Gentiles
,
that
they
shall
be
like
unto
a
father
to
them
;
wherefore
,
the
Gentiles
shall
be
blessed
and
numbered
among
the
Honse
of
Israch
—
Wherefore
,
I
will
consecrate
this
land
unto
thy
seed
and
they
which
shall
be
numbered
among
thy
seed
,
forever
,
for
the
land
of
their
inheritance
:
For
it
is
a
choice
land
,
saith
God
unto
me
,
aboye
all
other
lands
;
wherefore
,
I
will
have
all
men
_that
dwell
thereon
,
that
they
shall
worship
me
,
saith
God
.
And
now
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
secing
that
our
merciful
God
hath
given
us
so
great
knowledge
concerning
these
things
,
ict
us
remember
him
,
and
lay
aside
our
sins
,
and
not
hang
down
our
heads
,
for
we
are
not
cast
off
;
nevertheless
,
we
haye
been
driven
out
of
the
land
of
our
inheritance
;
but
we
have
been
led
to
a
better
land
:
for
the
Lord
hath
made
the
sca
our
path
,
and
we
are
upon
an
isle
of
the
sea
.
But
great
is
the
promises
of
the
Lord
unto
they
which
are
upon
the
isles
af
the
sea
;
wherefore
,
as
it
sayeth
isles
,
there
must
needs
be
more
than
this
;
and
they
are
inhabited
also
by
our
brethren
.
Por
behold
,
the
Lord
God
hath
led
away
from
time
to
time
:
from
the
House
of
Israel
,
according
to
his
will
and
pleasure
.
And
now
,
behold
,
the
Lord
remembereth
all
they
which
have

been
broken
off
;
wherefore
,
he
remembereth
us
also
.
Therefore
cher
up
your
hearts
,
and
remember
that
ye
are
free
to
act
for
yourselves
:
to
choose
the
way
of
everlasting
death
,
or
the
way
of
eternal
life
,
Wherefore
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
reconcile
yourselves
to
the
will
of
God
,
and
not
to
the
will
of
the
Devil
and

are
reconciled
unto
God
,
that
itis
only
in
and
through
the
grace
of
God
that
ye
are
saved

Wherefore
,
may
God
raise
you
from
death
,
by
the
power
of
the
resurrection
;-
and
also
from
everlasting
death
,
by
the
power
of

atonement
,
that
ye
may
be
received
into
the
Eternal
Kingdom
of

praise
him
through
Grace
Divine

Axp
now
Jacob
spake
many
more
things
to
my
people
x
that
time
;
nevertheless
,
only
these
things
have
I
caused
tobe
Written
:
for
the
things
which
I
Lave
written
,
suiliceth
me
,
And
now
1
,
Nephi
,
write
more
of
the
words
of
Isaiah
:
for
my
soul
dvlighteth
in
his
words
.
For
I
will
liken
his
work
uuto
my
people
;
and
I
will
send
them
forth
unto
all
my
chik
dren
:
for
he
verily
saw
my
Redeemer
,
even
as
1
have
Seen
him
.
Anid'my
brother
Jacob
also
hath
seen
him
as
I
haye
scen
him
;
wherefore
,
I
will
send
their
words
forth
unto
my
children
,
to
prove
unto
them
that
my
words
are
true
.
W
hens
fore
,
by
the
words
of
three
,
God
hath
said
,
I
will
establish
ny
word
.
Nevertheless
,
God
sendeth
more
Witnesses
;
and
he
proveth
all
his
words
.
Behold
,
my
soul
delighteth
in
proving
unto
my
people
the
truth
of
the
coming
of
Christ
:
for
,
for
the
end
hath
the
law
of
Moses
been
given
;
and
all
things
whieh
have
been
given
of
God
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
,
unty
man
,
are
the
typifying
of
him
.
And
also
,
my
soul
delightel
in
the
covenants
of
the
Lord
which
be
hath
made
to
ourfe
thers
;
yea
,
my
soul
delighteth
in
his
grace
,
and
his
justice
,
and
power
,
and
mercy
,
in
the
great
and
eternal
plan
of
delverance
from
death
.
And
my
soul
delighteth
in
proving
unio
my
people
,
that
save
Christ
should
come
,
all
men
must
perish
,
For
if
there
be
no
Christ
,
(
here
be
no
God
;
and
if
there
k
no
God
,
we
are
not
,
for
there
could
have
been
no
creation
—
But
there
is
a
God
,
and
he
is
Christ
;
and
he
cometh
in
tle
fulness
of
his
own
time
,
And
now
,
I
write
some
of
the
words
of
Isaiah
,
that
whos
of
my
people
which
shall
see
these
words
,
may
lift
up
their
hearts
and
rejoice
for
all
men
.
Now
,
these
are
ihe
words
;
and
ye
may
liken
them
unto

unto
all

The
word

Isaiah

And

The
shew
of
their

doth
witness
against

doth
declare
their
sin
to
be
cven
as
Sodom

and
they
cannot
hide
it

Wo
unto
their
souls
!
for
they
have
rewarded
evil
unto
themselves

unto
the
righteous

that
it
is
well

unto
the
wicked
!
for
they
shall
perish

for
the
reward
of
their
hands
shall
be
upon
them

And
my
people

children
are

oppressors

rule
over

thee

The
Lord
will
enter
into
Judgment
with
the

Ye

Because

In
that
day
the
Lord
will
take
away
the
bravery
of
tinkling

,
and

,
and
round

like

Fae
And
then
willl
sing
to
my
well
beloved
a
song
of
my
below
ved
touching
his
vineyard
.
My
well
-
beloved
hath
a
vineyard
in
a
very
fruitful
hill
:
and
he
fenced
it
,
and
gathered
out
the
—
stones
thereof
,
and
planted
it
with
the
choicest
vine
,
and
built
a
tower
in
.
the
midst
of
it
,
and
also
made
a
wine
-
press
therein
:
and
he
looked
that
it
should
bring
forth
grapes
,
and
it
brought
_
forth
wild
grapes
.
And
now
,
O
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
,
and
men
of
Judah
,
judge
,
I
pray
you
,
betwixt
me
and
my
vineyard
.
What
could
have
been
done
more
to
my
vineyard
,
that
.
have
.
[File:094]
not
done
in
it
?
wherefore
,
when
J
looked
that
it
should
bring
forth
grapes
,
it
brought
forth
wild
grapes
.
And
now
go
to
;
1
will
tell
you
what
T
will
do
to
my
vineyard
:
J
twill
take
away
the
hedge
thereof
,
and
it
shall
be
eaten
up
;
and
I
will
break
down
the
wall
thereof
,
and
it
shall
be
trodden
down
:
and
]
will
lay
it
waste
:
it
shall
not
be
pruned
,
nor
digged
;
but
then
!
”
shall
come
up
briers
and
thorns
:
1
will
also
command
the
clouds
that
they
rain
no
rain
upon
it
.
For
the
vineyard
of
the
Lord
of
hosts
is
the
House
of
Israel
,
and
the
men
of
Judah
his
pleasant
plant
:
and
he
looked
for
judgment
,
and
behold
op
.
pression
;
for
righteousness
,
but
behold
a
ery
.
Wo
unto
them
that
join
house
to
house
,
till
there
can
be
no
place
,
that
they
may
be
placed
alone
in
the'midst
of
the
carth
!
tn
mine
ears
,
said
the
Lord
of
hosts
,
Of
a
truth
many
houses
shall
be
desolate
,
and
great
and
fair
cities
without
inhabitant
Yea
,
ten
acres
of
vineyard
shall
yield
one
bath
,
and
the
secdai
4
horner
shall
yield
an
ephah
.
Wo
unto
them
that
rise
up
early
in
the
morning
,
that
they
may
follow
strong
drink
;
that
continue
until
night
,
and
wine
inflame
them
!
And
the
harp
,
and
the
viol
,
the
tabret
,
and
pipe
,
and
wine
,
are
in
their
feasts
:
but
they
regard
not
the
work
of
the
Lord
,
neither
consider
the
operation
of
his
hands
.
Therefore
my
people
are
gone
mto
captivity
,
because
they
have
no
knowledge
:
and
their
honorable
men
are
famished
,
and
their
multitude
dried
ap
with
thirst
.
Therefore
hell
hath
enlarged
herself
,
and
opened
her
mouth
without
measure
:
and
their
glory
,
and
their
multitude
,
and
their
pomp
,
and
he
the
!
rejoiceth
,
shall
descend
into
it
.
And
the
mean
man
shall
be
brought
down
,
and
the
mighty
man
shall
be
humbled
,
and
the
eyes
of
the
lofty
shall
be
humbled
:
but
the
Lord
of
hosts
shall
be
exalted
in
judgment
,
and
God
that
is
holy
shail
be
sanetified
in
righteousncss
,
Then
shall
the
lambs
feed
after
their
manner
,
and
the
waste
places
of
the
fat
ones
shall
stranger
cal
.
Wo
unto
them
that
draw
iniquity
with
cords
of
vanity
,
and
sin
as
it
were
witha
cart
-
rope
:
that
say
,
Let
him
make
speed
,
hasten
his
work
,
that
we
may
sec
it
:
and
let
the
cou
scl
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
draw
nigh
and
come
,
that
we
may
know
it
.
Wo
unto
them
that
call
evil
good
,
and
good
evil
;
that
prt
darkness
for

,
and
light
for

;
that

and

Wo
unto
the
wise
in
their

,
and
prudent
in
their
own
sight
!
Wo
unto
the
mighty

,
and
men
of

:
a
P
[File:095]
justify
the
wicked
for
reward
,
and
take
away
the
righteousness
of
the
righteous
from
him
!
Therefore
as
the
fire
devoureth
the
stubble
,
and
the
flame
consumeth
the
chaff
,
their
root
shall
be
rottenness
,
and
their
blossoms
shall
go
up
as
dust
:
because
they
have
cast
away
the
law
of
the
Lord
of
hosts
,
and
despised
the
word
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
.
Therefore
is
the
anger
of
the
Lord
kindled
against
his
people
,
and
he
hath
stretched
forth
his
hand
against
them
,
and
hath
smitten
them
:
and
the
hills
did
tremble
,
and
their
carcasses
were
torn
in
the
midst
of
the
streets
.
For
all
this
his
anger
is
not
tured
away
,
but
his
hand
stretched
out
still
.
And
he
will
lift
up
an
ensign
to
the
nations
from
far
,
and
will
hiss
unto
them
from
the
end
of
the
earth
;
and
behold
,
they
shall
come
with
speed
swiftly
:
none
shall
be
weary
nor
stumble
among
them
;
none
shall
slumber
nor
sleep
;
neither
shall
the
girdle
of
their
loins
be
loosed
,
nor
the
latchet
of
their
shoes
be
broken
:
whose
arrows
shall
be
sharp
,
and
all
their
bows
bent
,
and
their
horses'
hoofs
shall
be
counted
like
flint
,
and
their
wheels
like
a
whirlwind
,
their
roaring
like
a
lion
—
They
shall
roar
like
young
lions
:
yea
,
they
shall
roar
,
and
lay
hold
of
the
prey
,
and
shall
carry
away
safc
,
and
none
shall
deliver
.
And
in
that
day
they
shall
roar
against
them
like
the
roaring
of
the
sea
:
and
if
they
look
unto
the
land
,
behold
,
shi
and
sorrow
,
and
the
light
is
darkened
in
the
heavens
thereof

CHAPTER
IX
.
In
the
year
that
king
Uzziah
died
,
I
saw
also
the
Lord
sitting
upon
a
throne
,
high
and
lified
up
,
and
his
train
filled
the
temple
.
Above
it
stood
the
seraphims
:
cach
ono
had
six
wings
;
with
twain
he
covered
his
face
,
and
with
twain
he
covered
his
feet
,
and
with
twain
le
did
fly
.
And
one
cried
unto
another
,
and
said
,
Holy
,
holy
,
holy
,
is
the
Lord
of
hosts
:
the
whole
earth
is
full
of
his
glory
.
And
the
posts
of
the
door
moved
at
the
voice
of
him
that
cried
,
and
the
house
was
filled
with
smoke
.
Then
said
I
,
Wo
me
!
for
1
am
undone
;
because
I
a
man
of
unclean
lips
,
and
1
dwell
in
the
midst
of
a
people
of
unclean
lips
:
for
mine
eyes
have
secn
the
King
,
the
Lord
of
hosts
,—
Then
flew
one
of
the
seraphims
unto
me
,
having
a
live
coal
in
[File:096]
bis
hand
,
which
he
had
taken
with
the
tongs
from
off
the
altar
:
and
he
laid
it
upon
my
mouth
,
and
said
,
Lo
,
this
has
touched
thy
lips
;
and
thine
iniquity
is
taken
away
,
and
thy
sin
purged
,
Also
heard
the
yoice
of
the
Lord
,
saying
,
Whom
shall
1
send
,
and
who
will
go
for
us
?
Then
I
said
,
Here
1
;
send
me
.
And
he
said
,
Go
,
and
tell
this
people
,
Hear
ye
indeed
,
but
they
understand
not
;
and
see
ye
indeed
,
but
they
perceived
not
.
Make
the
heart
of
this
people
fat
,
and
mate
their
ears
heavy
,
and
shut
their
eyes
;
lest
they
see
with
their
eyes
,
and
hear
with
their
ears
,
and
understand
with
their
heart
,
and
convert
,
and
be
healed
.
Then
said
J
,
Lord
,
how
long
?
And
he
said
,
Until
the
-
cities
be
wasted
without
inhabitant
,
and
the
houses
without
man
,
and
the
land
be
utterly
desolate
;
and
the
Lord
have
removed
men
far
away
,
for
there
shall
be
a
great
forsaking
in
the
midst
of
the
land
,
But
yet
in
it
there
shall
be
a
tenth
,
and
they
shall
return
,
aud
shall
be
eaten
:
as
a
teil
-
tree
,
and
as
an
oak
whose
sub
seed
shall
be
the
substance
thereof
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
Ahaz
the
son
of
Jotham
,
the
son
of
Uzziah
,
king
of
Judah
,
and
Rezin
,
king
of
Syria
,
and
Pekah
the
son
of
Remaliah
,
king
of
Israel
,
went
up
towards
Jerusalem
to
war
against
it
,
but
could
not
prevail
against
it
,
And
it
syas
told
the
house
of
David
,
saying
,
Syria
is
confederate
with
Ephraim
.
And
his
heart
was
moved
,
and
the
heart
of
his
people
,
as
the
trecs
of
the
wood
are
moved
with
the
wind
.,
Then
said
the
Lord
unto
Isaiah
,
Go
forth
now
to
meet
haz
,
thou
,
and
Shearjashub
thy
son
,
at
the
end
of
the
conduit
of
the
upper
pool
in
the
highway
of
the
fuller's
field
;
and
say
unto
him
,
Take
heed
,
and
be
quiet
;
fear
not
,
neither
he
faint
-
hearted
for
the
two
tails
of
these
smoking
fire
-
brands
,
for
the
fierce
anger
of
Rezin
with
Syria
,
and
of
the
son
of
Remalah
.
Because
Syria
,
Ephraim
,
and
the
son
of
Remaliah
,
have
taken
eyil
counsel
against
thee
,
saying
,
Let
us
go
up
against
Judah
,
and
vex
it
,
and
let
us
make
a
breach
therein
for
us
,
and
set
a
king
in
the
midst
of
it
,
yea
the
son
of
Tabeal
:
thus
saith
the
Lord
God
,
it
shall
not
stand
,
neither
shall
it
come
to
pass
.
For
the
head
of
Syria
is
Damascus
,
and
the
head
of
amascus
,
Rezin
:
and
within
threescore
and
five
years
shalt
Epbraim
be
broken
,
that
it
be
not
a
people
.
And
the
head
of
Ephraim
is
Samaria
,
and
the
head
of
Samaria
is
Remaliah's
son
,
If
ye
will
not
helieve
,
surcly
ye
shall
not
be
established
.
Moreover
,
the
Lord
spake
again
unto
Ahaz
,
saying
,
Ask
stance
is
-
in
them
,
when
they
cast
their
leaves
:
so
the
holy
[File:097]
thee
a
sign
of
the
Lord
thy
God
;
ask
it
cither
in
the
depths
,
or
jn
the
heights
above
.
But
Ahaz
said
,
1
will
not
ask
,
neither
will
[tempt
the
Lord
.
And
he
said
,
Hear
ye
now
,
O
house
of
David
;
Is
it
a
small
thing
for
you
to
weary
men
,
but
will
ye
weary
my
God
also
?
Therefore
the
Lord
himself
shall
give
you
A
sign
:
Behold
,
a
virgin
shall
conceiye
,
and
shall
bear
a
son
,
and
shall
call
bis
name
Immanuel
.
Butter
and
honey
shal
!
he
eat
,
that
he
may
know
to
refuse
the
evil
,
and
to
choose
the
good
.
For
before
the
child
shall
know
to
refuse
the
evil
and
choose
the
good
,
the
land
that
thou
abhorrest
shall
be
forsaken
of
both
her
kings
.
The
Lord
shall
bring
upon
thee
,
and
upon
thy
people
,
and
upon
thy
father's
house
,
days
that
have
not
come
,
from
the
day
that
Ephrann
departed
from
Judah
,
the
king
of
Assyria
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
,
that
the
Lord
shall
hiss
for
the
fly
that
is
in
the
uttermost
part
of
Egypt
,
and
for
the
bee
that
isin
the
land
of
Assyria
.
And
they
shall
come
,
and
shall
rest
all
of
them
in
the
desclate
valleys
,
and
in
the
holes
of
the
rocks
,
and
upon
all
thorns
,
and
upon
all
bushes
.
In
the
same
day
shall
the
Lord
shave
with
a
razor
that
is
hired
,
by
them
beyond
the
siver
,
by
the
king
of
Assyria
,
the
head
,
and
the
hair
of
the
feet
:
and
it
shall
also
consume
the
beard
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
,
a
man
shall
nourish
a
young
cow
,
and
two
sheep
;
and
it
shali
come
to
pass
,
for
the
abundance
of
milk
they
shall
give
,
he
shall
eat
butter
:
for
butter
and
honey
shall
every
one
eat
that
is
left
in
the
Jand
.—
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
,
every
place
shall
be
,
where
there
were
a
thousand
vines
at
a
thousand
silveriings
,
which
shall
be
for
briers
and
thorns
.
With
arrows
and
with
bows
shall
men
come
thither
;
because
all
the
land
shall
become
briers
and
thorns
.
And
all
hills
that
shail
be
digged
with
the
mattock
,
there
shall
not
come
thither
the
fear
of
briers
and
thorns
:
but
it
shall
be
for
the
sending
forth
of
oxen
,
and
the
treading
of
lesser
cattle
.
Moreover
,
the
word
of
the
Lord
said
unto
me
,
Take
thee
a
great
roll
,
and
write
in
it
with
a
man's
pen
concerning
Mahershalal
-
hash
-
baz
.
And
I
took
unto
me
faithful
witnesses
to
record
,
Uriah
the
priest
,
and
Zechariah
the
son
of
Jeberechiah
.
And
I
went
unto
the
prophetess
;
and
she
conceived
and
bear
a
son
.
Then
said
the
Lord
to
me
,
Call
his
name
Mahershalal
-
hash
-
haz
,
For
bebold
,
the
child
shall
not
have
knowledce
to
cry
,
My
father
,
and
my
mother
,
before
the
riches
of
[File:098]
Damascus
and
the
spoil
of
Samaria
shall
be
taken
away
be
fore
the
king
of
Assyria
.
The
Lord
spake
also
unto
me
again
,
saying
,
Forasmuch
ay
this
people
refuseth
the
waters
of
Shiloal
that
go
softly
,
anj
rejoice
in
Rezin
und
Remaliah's
son
;
now
therefore
,
behold
,
the
Lord
bringeth
up
upon
them
the
waters
of
the
river
,
strong
and
many
,
even
the
king
of
Assyria
,
and
all
his
glory
:
and
he
shall
come
up
over
all
his
channels
,
and
go
over
all
his
banks
:
and
he
shall
pass
through
Judah
;
he
shall
overflow
and
Bo
over
,
he
shall
reach
even
to
the
neck
;
and
the
stretching
out
of
his
wings
shall
fill
the
breadth
of
thy
land
,
O
Immanuel
,
;
Associate
yourselves
,
O
ye
people
,
and
ye
shall
be
brokey
inpicces
;
and
give
car
all
ye
of
far
countries
:
gird
yourselves
,
and
ye
shall
be
broken
in
pieces
;
gird
yourselves
,
and
ye
shall
be
broken
in
picecs
.
Take
counse
)
together
and
it
shall
come
to
nopght
;
speak
the
word
,
and
it
shall'
not
stand
:
for
God
is
with
us
.
For
the
Lord
spake
thus
to
me
with
a
strong
hand
,
and
in
.
structed
me
that
I
should
not
walk
in
the
way
of
this
people
,
saying
,
Say
ye
nol
,
A
confederacy
,
to
all
to
whom
this
people
shall
say
,
A
confederacy
;
neither
fear
ye
their
fear
,
nov
be
afraid
.
Sanctify
the
Lord
of
hosts
himself
,
and
let
him
be
your
fear
,
and
let
lim
be
your
drcad
.
And
he
shall
be
fora
sanctuary
;
but
for
a
stone
of
stumbling
and
for
a
rock
of
of
fence
to
both
the
Houses
of
Israel
,
for
a
gin
and
a
snare
to
the
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
.
And
many
among
them
shall
stum
ble
,
and
fall
,
and
be
broken
,
and
be
snared
,
and
be
taken
,—
Bind
up
the
testimony
,
seal
the
law
among
iy
disciples
,
And
I
will
wail
upon
the
Lord
,
that
hideth
his
face
from
the
house
of
Jacob
,
and
1
will
look
for
him
.
Behold
,
and
the
children
whom
the
Lord
hath
given
me
are
for
signs
aud
for
wonders
in
Tsracl
from
the
Lord
of
hosts
,
which
dielleth
in
mount
.
Zion
,
'
And
when
they
shall
say
unto
you
,
Seek
unto
them
that”
haye
familiar
spirits
,
and
unto
wizards
that
peep
,
and
mutter
:
should
not
a
people
seek
unto
their
God
?
for
the
living
to
hear
from
the
dead
?
to
the
law
and
to
the
testimony
:
and
if
they
speak
not
according
to
this
word
,
it
is
because
there
isnolight
in
them
,
And
they
shall
pass
through
it
,
hardly
bestead
and
hungry
:
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
,
that
when
they
shall
be
hungry
,
hey
shall
fret
themselves
,
and
curse
their
king
and
their
God
,
and
touk
upward
.
And
they
shall
look
unto
the
earth
;
and
be
[File:099]
jold
trouble
and
darkness
,
dimness
of
anguish
,
and
shall
be
driven
to
darkness
.
Nevertheless
the
dimness
shall
not
be
such
as
was
in
her
vexation
,
when
at
the
first
he
lightly
afflicted
the
land
of
Zebulun
,
and
the
Jand
of
Naphtali
,
and
afterwards
did
more
grieyously
aillict
by
the
way
of
the
Red
Sea
beyond
Jordan
,
in
Galilee
of
the
nations
.
The
people
that
walked
in
darkness
have
seena
great
light
:
they
that
dwell
in
the
land
of
the
shadow
of
death
,
upon
them
hath
the
light
shined
.
Thou
hast
multiplied
the
nation
,
and
increased
the
joy
:
they
joy
before
thee
according
to
the
joy
in
harvest
,
and
-
as
men
rejoice
when
they
divide
the
spoil
.
For
thou
hast
broken
the
yoke
of
his
burden
,
and
the
staff
of
his
shoulder
,
the
rod
of
bis
oppressor
,
For
every
battle
of
the
warrior
with
confused
noise
,
and
garments
rolled
in
blood
;
but
this
shall
be
with
burning
and
tuel
offire
,
For
unto
us
a
child
is
born
,
unto
us
a
son
is'
given
:
and
the
government
shall
be
upon
his
shoulder
:
and
his
name
shall
be
called
Wonderful
,
Counsellor
,
The
mighty
God
,
The
everlasting
Father
,
The
Prince
of
Peace
.
Of
the
increase
of
government
and
peace
there
is
no
end
,
upon
the
throne
of
Dayid
,
and
upon
his
kingdom
,
to
order
it
,
and
to
establish
it
with
judgment
and
with
justice
from
henceforth
even
forever
.
The
zeal
of
the
Lord
of
hosts
will
perform
this
.
The
Lord
sent
his
word
unto
Jacob
and
it
hath
lighted
upon
Israel
.
And
all
the
people
shall
know
,
even
Ephraim
and
the
inhabitants
of
Samaria
,
that
say
in
the
pride
and
the
stoutness
of
heart
,
The
bricks
are
fallen
down
,
but
we
will
build
with
hewn
stones
:
the
syeamores
are
cut
down
,
but
we
will
change
them
into
cedars
.
Therefore
the
Lord
shal}
set
up
the
adversaries
of
Rezin
against
him
,
and
join
his
enemies
together
;
the
Syrians
before
,
and
the
Philistines
behind
:
and
they
shall
devour
Israel
with
open
mouth
.
For
all
this
his
anger
is
notturned
away
,
but
his
hand
stretched
out
still
.
For
the
people
turneth
not
unto
him
that
smiteth
them
,
neither
,
do
they
seek
the
Lord
of
hosts
.
Therefore
will
the
Lord
cutoff
from
Israel
head
and
tail
,
branch
and
rush
in
one
day
.—
The
ancient
,
he
is
the
head
;
and
the
prophet
that
teacheth
lies
,
he
is
the
tail
.
For
the
leaders
of
this
people
cause
them
to
err
;
and
they
that
are
led
of
them
are
destroyed
.
Therefore
the
Lord
shall
have
no
joy
in
their
young
men
,
neither
shall
haye
mercy
on
their
fatherless
and
widows
:
for
every
one
of
them
is
a
hypocrite
and
an
evil
-
doer
,
and
cvery
mouth
speaketh
[File:100]
folly
.
For
ull
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
,
but
hj
hand
stretched
out
still
,
For
wickedaess
burneth
as
the
fire
;
it
shall
devour
fh
briers
and
thorns
,
and
shal
!
kindle
in
the
thickets
of
the
fo
rests
,
and
they
shall
mount
up
like
the
lifting
up
of
smoke
Through
the
wrath
of
the
Lord
of
hosts
is
the
land
darkened
and
the
people
shall
he
as
the
fuel
of
the
fire
:
no
man
shal
spare
his
brother
.
And
he
shalt
snatch
on
the
right
hand
,
ang
be
hungry
;
and
he
shall
eat
on
the
left
hand
,
and
they
shall
not
be
sutistied
:
they
shall
eat
every
man
the
fesh
of
his
omy
arm
:
Manasseh
,
Uphraim
;
and
Ephraim
,
Manasseh
:
they
to
gether
shall
be
againet
Judah
.
For
all
this
his
anger
is
nol
turned
away
,
but
his
hand
stretched
out
still
,
Wo
unto
them
that
decree
unrighteous
decrees
,
and
that
write
grievousness
which
they
have
prescribed
;
to
(
urn
aside
the
needy
from
judgment
,
and
to
take
aw
ay
the
right
from
the
poor
of
iny
people
,
that
widows
may
be
their
prey
,
and
that
they
may
rob
the
fatherless
!
And
what
will
ye
doin
the
dey
of
visitation
,
and
in
the
desolation
which
shall
come
from
far
!
fo
whom
will
ye
flee
for
help
?
and
where
will
ye
leave
your
glory
?
Without
me
they
shall
bow
down
under
the
prisoners
,
and
they
shall
fall
under
the
slain
.
For
all
this
his
anger
ia
not
turned
away
,
but
bis
hand
stretched
out
still
.
O
Assyrian
,
the
rod
of
mine
anger
,
and
the
staff
in
their
hand
is
their
indignation
.
Twill
send
him
against
a
hypoen
tical
nation
,
and
against
the
people
of
my
wrath
will
I
give
him
a
charge
,
to
take
the
spoil
,
and
to
take
the
prey
,
and
to
tread
them
down
like
the
mire
of
the
streets
.
Howbeit
he
incaneth
not
so
,
neither
doth
his
heart
think
sos
but
in
his
heart
itis
4o
destroy
and
cut'off
nations
not
a
few
,
For
he
saith
,
Are
not
my
princes
altogether
kings
?
Is
not
Calno
as
Carche
mish
?
Is
not
Hamath
as
Arpad
?
Is
not
Samaria
as
Danas
ens
?
As
my
hand
hath
founded
the
kingdoms
of
the
idols
,
and
whose
graven
images
did
excel
them
of
Jerusalem
and
of
Se
maria
;
shall
¥
not
,
as
I
have
done
unto
Samaria
and
her
idols
,
.
80
do
to
Jerusalem
and
to
her
idols
?
Wherefore
it
shall
come
to
pass
,
that
when
the
Lord
hath
performed
his
whole
work
upon
mount
ion
and
upon
Jerusalem
,
I
will
punish
the
frait
of
the
stout
heart
of
the
king
of
Aasyria
,
and
the
glory
of
his
high
looks
.
For
he
saith
,
By
the
strength
of
my
hand
and
by
iny
wisdom
I
tlave
done
these
things
;
for
Iam
prudent
:
and
Vhave
moved
the
borders
of
the
people
,
and
have
robbed
their
[File:101]
yreasures
,
and
Ihave
put
down
the
inhabitants
like
a
valiant
man
;
and
my
hand
hath
found
as
a
nest
the
riches
of
the
peo
ie
:
and
as
one
gathereth
eggs
that
are
left
,
have
I
gathered
all
the
earth
;
and
there
was
none
that
moved
the
wing
,
or
opened
the
mouth
,
or
peeped
.
Shall
the
axe
boast
itself
against
hum
that
beweth
therewith
?
Shall
.
the
saw
magnify
itself
against
him
that
shaketh
it
?
as
if
the
rod
should
shake
itself
against
them
that
lift
it
up
,
or
as
if
the
staff
should
lift
up
itself
,
as
if
it
were
no
wood
.
Therefore
shall
the
Lord
,
the
Lord
of
hosts
,
send
among
his
fat
ones
leanness
;
and
under
his
glory
he
shall
kindle
a
burning
like
the
burning
of
a
fire
.
And
the
light
of
Israel
shall
be
for
a
fire
,
and
his
Holy
One
for
a
flame
,
and
shall
burn
and
shall
devour
his
thorns
and
his
briers
in
one
day
;
and
shall
consume
the
glory
of
his
forest
,
and
of
his
fruitful
field
,
both
soul
and
body
;
and
they
shall
be
as
when
a
standard
-
bearer
fuinteth
.
And
the
rest
of
the
trees
of
his
forest
shall
be
few
,
that
a
child
say
write
them
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
,
that
the
remant
of
Israel
,
and
such
as
are
escaped
of
the
house
of
Jacob
,
shall
no
more
again
stay
upon
him
that
smote
them
;
but
shall
stay
upon
the
Lord
,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
in
truth
.
The
remnant
shall
return
,
yea
,
even
the
remnant
of
Jacob
,
unto
the
mighty
God
.
For
though
thy
people
Israel
be
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
,
yet
aremnant
of
them
shall
return
:
the
consumption
decreed
—
shall
overflow
with
righteousness
.
For
the
Lord
God
of
hosts
shail
make
a
consumption
,
even
determined
,
in
all
the
land
.
Therefore
thus
saith
the
Lord
God
of
hosts
,
O
my
people
that
dwellest
in
Zion
,
be
not
afraid
of
the
Assyrian
:
he
shall
smite
thee
with
a
rod
,
and
shall
lift
up
his
staff
against
thee
,
after
the
manner
of
Egypt
.
For
yet
a
very
little
while
,
and
the
indignation
shall
cease
,
and
mine
anger
in
their
destruction
.
And
the
Lord
of
hosts
shall
stir
up
a
scourge
for
him
according
to
the
slaughter
of
Midian
at
the
reek
of
Oreb
;
and
as
his
rod
was
upon
the
sea
,
so
shall
he
lift
it
up
after
the
manner
of
Egypt
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
,
that
his
burden
shall
be
taken
away
from
off
thy
shoulder
,
and
his
yoke
from
off
thy
neck
,
and
the
yoke
shail
be
destroyed
because
of
the
anoimting
.
He
is
come
to
Aiath
,
he
is
passed
to
Migron
;
at
Michmash
he
hath
laid
up
his
carriages
;
they
are
gone
over
the
passage
;
they
have
taken
up
their
lodging
at
Geba
;
Ramath
is
afraid
;
Gibeah
of
Saulis
fled
.
Lift
up
the
voire
,
O
daughse
of
Gallium
;
cause
it
to
be
heard
unto
Laish
,
O
poor
Ana
-
[File:102]
thoth
.
Madmenah
is
removed
;
the
inhabitants
of
Gebim
gather
themselves
to
flee
.
As
yet
shal
)
he
remain
at
Nob
that
day
;
hie
shall
shake
:
his
hand
against
the
mount
of
the
daughter
of
Zion
,
the
hillof
Jerusalem
.
Behold
,
the
Lord
,
the
Lord
of
hosts
shall
lop
the
bough
with
terror
;
and
the
high
ones
of
Stature

and
the

shall

And
he
shalt
cut
down
the
thickets
of
the
forests
with
iron
,
and
Lebanon
shall
fall
by
a
mighty
one
.
And
there
shall
come
forth
a
rod
out
of
the
stem
of
Jesse
,
and
2
branch
shall
grow
out
of
his
roots
;
and
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
shall
rest
upon
him
,
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
understan

ding
,
the
spirit
of
counsel
and
might
,
the
spirit
of
knowledge
and
of
the
fear
of
the
Lord
;
and
shall
make
himof
quick
under
standing
in
the
fear
of
the
Lord
;
and
he
shall
not
judge
after
the
sight
of
his
eyes
,
neither
reprove
after
the
hearing
of
his
ears
:
but
with
righteousness
shall
he
judge
the
poor
,
and
re
prove
with
equity
forthe
meck
of
the
earth
:
and
he
shall
smite
the
earth
with
the
rod
of
his
mouth
,
and
with
the
breath
of
his
fips
shall
he
slay
the
wicked
,
And
righteousness
shall
be
the
girdle
of
his
loins
,
and
faithfulness
the
girdle
of
his
reins
.
The
wolf
also
shall
dwell
with
the
lamb
,
and
the
leopard
shall
lie
down
with
the
kid
;
and
the
calf
and
the
young
lion
and
the
fatling
together
;
and
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
.
And
the
cow
and
the
bear
shall
feed
;
their
young
ones
shall
lie
down”
together
;
and
the
lion
shall
eat
straw
like
the
ox
.
And
the
sucking
child
shall
play
on
the
hole
of
the
asp
,
and
the
weaned
child
shall
put
his
hand
on
the
cockatrice's
den
.
They
shall
not
hurt
nor
destroy
in
all
my
holy
mountain
:
for
the
earth
shail
be
full
of
the
knowledge
of
the
Lord
,
as
the
waters
cover
the
sea
.
And
in
that
day
there
shall
be
a
root
of
Jesse
,
which
shall
stand
for
an
ensign
of
the
people
;
to
it
shall
the
Gentiles
seek
:
and
his
rest
shall
be
glorious
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
,
that
the
Lord
shall
set
his
hand
again
the
second
tine
to
recover
the
remnant
of
his
people
,
which
shall
be
left
from
Assyria
,
and
from
Egypt
,
and
from
Pathros
,
and
from
Cush
,
and
from
Elam
,
and
from
Shinar
,
and
from
Hamath
,
and
from
the
isiands
of
the
sea
,
And
he
shall
set
up
an
ensign
for
the
nations
,
and
shall
assemble
the
outcasts
of
:
Israel
,
and
gather
together
the
dispersed
of
Judah
from
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
,
The
envy
of
Ephraim
also
shall
depart
,
and
the
adversaries
of
Judah
shall
be
cut
off
:
Ephraim
shali
not
envy
Judah
,
and
Judah
shall
not
vex
Epluaim
.
But
they
[File:103]
shall
fly
npon
the
shoulders
of
the
Philistines
toward
the
west
;
they
shall
spoil
them
of
the
east
together
;
they
shall
lay
their
hand
upon
Edom
and
Moab
;
and
the
children
of
Ammon
shall
obey
them
.
And
the
Lord
shall
utterly
destroy
the
tongue
of
the
Egyptian
sea
;
and
with
his
mighty
wind
he
shall
shake
his
hand
over
the
river
,
and
shall
smite
it
in
the
seven
streams
;
and
make
men
go
over
dry
shod
.
And
there
shall
be
a
high
-,
way
for
the
remnant
of
his
people
,
which
shall
be
left
,
from
Assyria
,
like
us
it
was
to
Isracl
im
the
day
that
he
came
up
out
of
the
Jand
of
Egypt
.
And
in
that
day
thou
shalt
say
,
O
Lord
,
I
will
praise
thee
;
though
thou
wast
angry
with
me
,
thine
anger
is
turned
away
,
and
thou
comfortedst
me
,
Behold
,
God
is
my
salvation
;
1
will
trast
,
and
not
be
afraid
:
for
the
Lord
JEHOVAH
is
my
strength
and
my
song
;
he
also
isbecome
my
salvation
.
Therefore
with
joy
shall
ye
draw
water
out
of
the
wells
of
salvation
.
And
in
that
day
shall
ye
say
,
Praise
the
Lord
,
call
upon
his
name
,
declare
his
doings
among
the
people
,
make
mention
that
his
name
is
exalted
.
Sing
unto
the
Lord
;
for
he
hath
done
excellent
things
:
this
is
known
in
all
the
earth
.
Cry
out
and

,
thou

for

is
the
Holy

of

in

Lift

that

commanded
my

ones
,
Thave
also
called
my
mighty
ones
,
for
mine
anger
is
not
upon
them
that
rejoice
in
my
highness
.
The
noise
of
the
multitude
in
the
mountains
like
as
of
a
great
people
;
a
tumultuous
noise
of
the
kingdoms
of
nations
gathered
together
:
the
Lord
of
hosts
mustereth
the
hosts
of
the
battle
.
They
come
from
a
far
country
,
from
the
end
of
heaven
,
yea
,
the
Lord
,
and
the
weapons
of
his
indignation
,
to
destroy
the
whole
land
.
How]
ye
;
for
the
day
of
the
Lord
is
at
hand
:
it
shall
come
as
a
destruction
from
the
Almighty
.
Therefore
shall
all
hands
be
faint
,
every
man's
heart
shall
:
melt
;
and
they
shall
be
alraid
;
pangs
and
sorrows
shall
take
hold
of
them
;
they
shall
be
amazed
one
at
another
;
their
faces
shall
be
as
flames
.—
[File:104]
Behold
,
the
day
of
the
Lord
cometh
,
cruel
both
with
wrath
and
fierce
anger
,
to
lay
the
land
desolate
:
and
he
shall
destroy
the
sinners
thereof
out
of
it
..
For
the
stars
of
heaven
and
the
constellations
thereof
shall
not
give
their
light
;
the
sun
shal]
be
darkened
in
her
going
forth
,
and
the
moon
shall
not
cause
her
light
to
shine
.
And
f
will
punish
the
world
for
evil
,
and
the
wicked
for
their
iniquity
;
will
cause
the
arrogancy
of
the
proud
to
cease
,
and
will
lay
down
the
haughtiness
of
the
terrible
.
1
will
make
a
man
more
precious
than
fine
gold
;
even
aman
than
the
golden
wedge
of
Ophir
.
Therefore
will
shake
the
heavens
,
and
the
earth
shall
remove
out
of
her
place
,
in
the
wrath
of
the
Lord
of
hosts
,
and
in
the
day
of
his
fierce
anger
.
And
it
shall
be
as
the
chased
roe
,
and
as
a
sheep
-
fat
no
man
taketh
up
:
they
shall
every
man
turn
to
his
own
people
,
and
flee
every
one
into
his
own
land
.
Hyery
one
that
is
proud
shall
be
thrust
through
;
yea
,
and
every
one
that
is
joined
to
the
wicked
,
shall
fall
by
the
sword
.
Their
children
also
shall
be
dashed
to
pieces
before
their
eyes
;
their
houses
shall
he'spoiled
,
and
their
wives
ravished
.
Behold
,
1
will
stir
up
the
Medes
against
them
,
which
shall
not
regard
silver
and_
gold
,
nor
they
shall
not
delight
in
it
.
Their
bows
shall
also
dash
the
young
men
to
pieces
;
and
they
shall
have
no
pity
on
the
fruit
of
the
womb
;
their
eyes
shall
not
spare
children
.
_
And
Babylon
,
the
glory
of
kingdoms
,
the
beauty
ef
the
Chal
dees'
excellency
shall
be
as
when
God
overthrew
Sodom
and_
Gomorrah
.
I
shall
never
be
inhabited
,
neither
shall
it
be'
dwelt
in
from
generation
to
generation
:
neither
shall
the
Ara
bian
pitch
tent
there
:
neither
shall
the
shepherds
make
their
fold
there
:
but
wild
beasts
of
the
desert
shall
lie
there
;
and
their
houses
shall
be
full
of
doleful
creatures
;
and
owls
shall
dwell
there
,
and
satyrs
shalldance
there
.
And
the
wild
beasts
of
the
islands
shall
cry
in
their
desolate
houses
,
and
dragons
in
their
pleasant
palaces
:
and
her
time
is
near
to
come
,
and
her
day
shall
not
be
prolonged
.
For
I
will
destroy
her
speedily
;
yea
,
for
I
will
be
merciful
unto
my
people
:
but
the
wicked
shall
perish
.
For
the
Lord
will
have
mercy
on
Jacob
,
and
will
yet
choose
fsrael
,
and
set
them
in
their
own
land
:
and
the
strangers
shall
be
joined
with
them
,
and
they
shall
cleave
to
the
house
of
Jacob
.
And
the
people
shall
take
them
,
and
bring
them
to
their
wlace
:
yea
,
from
far
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
:
and
they
snati
return
to
their
lands
of
promise
.
And
the
house
of
Isracl
shall
possess
them
,
and
the
land
of
the
Lord
shal
be

servants
and
handmaids
:
and
they
shall
take
them
captives
,
unto
whom
they
were
captives
;
and
they
shall
rule
over
their
oppressors
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
that
.
the
Lord
shall
give
thee
rest
from
thy
serraw
,
and
from
thy
fear
,
and
from
the
hard
bondage
wherein
thou
wast
made
to
serve
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
,
that
thon
shalt
take
up
this
proverb
against
the
king
of
Babylon
,
and
say
,
How
hath
the
oppressor
ceased
,
the
golden
city
ceased
!
The
Lord
hath
broken
the
staff
of
the
wicked
,
the
sceptres
of
the
rulers
.
He
who
smote
the
people
m
wrath
with
a
continual
stroke
,
he
that
ruled
the
nations
in
anger
,
is
persecuted
,
and
none
hindereth
.
The
whole
carth
is
at
rest
,
and
is
quiet
:
they
break
forth
into
singing
.
Yea
,
the
fir
-
trees
rejoice
at
thee
,
and
also
the
cedars
of
Lebanon
,
saying
,
Since
thou
art
laid
down
,
no
feller
is
come
up
against
us
,
Hell
from
beneath
is
moved
for
thee
to
meet
ihee
at
thy
coming
:
it
stirreth
up
the
dead
for
thee
,
even
all
the
chief
ones
of
the
earth
:
it
hath
raised
up
from
their
thrones
all
ihe
kings
of
the
nations
.
All
they
shal]
speak
and
say
unto
thee
,
Art
thou
also
become
weak
as
we
?
Art
thou
become
like
unto
us
?
Thy
pomp
is
brought
down
to
the
grave
;
the
noise
of
thy
viols
is
not
heard
:
the
worm
is
spread
under
thee
,
and
the
worms
cover
thee
.
How
art
thou
fallen
from
heaven
,
O
Lucifer
,
son
of
the
morning
!
Art
thou
cut
down
to
the
ground
,
which
did
weaken
the
nations
!
For
thou
hast
said
in
thy
heart
,
I
will
ascend
into
heaven
,
J
will
exalt
my
throne
above
the
stars
of
God
:
1
will
sit
also
upon
the
mount
of
the
congregation
,
in
the
sides
of
the
north
;
I
will
ascend
above
the
heights
of
the
clouds
;
]
will
be
like
the
Most
High
.
Yet
thou
shalt
be
brought
down
to
hiell
,
to
the
sides
of
the
pit
.
They
that
see
thee
shall
narrowly
look
upon
thee
,
and
shall
consider
thee
,
and
shall
say
,
Is
this
the
man
that
made
the
earth
to
tremble
,
that
did
shake
kingdoms
,
and
made
the
world
as
a
wilderness
,
and
destroyed
the
cities
thereof
,
and
opened
not
ihe
house
of
his
prisoners
All
the
kings
of

nations
,
yea
,
all
of
them
,
lie
in
glory
,
every
one
of
them
in
his
own
house
.
But
thou
art
cast
out
of”
ihy
grave
like
an
abominable
branch
,
and
the
remnant
of
those
that
are
slain
,
thrust
through
with
a
sword
,
that
go
down
to
the
stones
of
the
pit
;
as
a
carcass
trodden
under
feet
.
Thou
shalt
not
be
joined
with
them
in
burial
,
because
thou
hast
destroyed
thy
land
,
and
slain
thy
people
:
the
seed
of
eyil
-
doers
shall
never
be
renowned
.
Prepare

for
the
iniquities
of

nor
fill

for

:
and
I
will
sweep

saith
the
Lord

:
The
Lord
of

Surely

that
I
will
brmg
the
Assyrian
in
my
land
,
and
upon
my
mountains
tread
him
under
foot
;
then
shall
his
yoke
depart
from
off
them
,
and
his
burden
depart
from
off
their
shoulders
,
This
is
the
purpose
that
is
purposed
upon
the
whole
earth
:
and
this
is
the
hand
that
is
stretched
out
upon
all
nations
.
For
the
Lord
of
hosts
hath
purposed
,
and
who
shail
disannul

And
his
hand
stretched
out
,
and
who
shall
turn
it
back
?
In
the
year
that
king
Alaz
died
was
this
burden
,
Rejoice
not
thou
,
whole
Palestina
,
because
the
rod
of
him
that
smote
thee
is
broken
:

And
the

and
I

shall
slay

O

O

thou

Now
I
,
Nephi
,
do
speak
somewhat
concerning
the
words
which
Ihave
written
,
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
Isaiah
.
For
behold
,
Isaiah
spake
many
things
which
were
hard
for
many
of
my
people
to
understand
:
for
they
know
not
concerning
the
manner
of
prophesying
among
the
Jews
.
For
I
,
Nephi
,
have
not
taught
them
many
things
concerning
the
manner
of
the
Jews
;
for
their
works
were
works
of
darkness
,
dud
their
doings
were
doings
of
abominations
,
Wherefore
,
I
write
unto
my
people
,
unto
all
they
that
shall
receive
hereafter
these
things
which
I
write
,
that
they
may
know
the
judgments
of
God
,
that
they
come
apon
all
na
[File:107]
tions
,
according
to
the
word
which
he
hath
spoken
.—
Wherefore
hearken
,
O
my
people
,
which
are
of
the
House
of
Israel
,
and
give
ear
unto
my
words
:
for
because
that
the
words
of
Isaiah
are
not
plain
unto
you
,
nevertheless
they
are
plain
unto
all
they
that
are
filled
with
the
spirit
of
propheey
.
But
I
give
unto
you
a
prophecy
,
according
to
the
spirit
which
is
in
me
5
wherefore
I
shall
prophesy
according
to
the
plainness
which
hath
been
with
me
from
the
time
that
.
Icame
out
from
Jerugalem
with
my
father
:
for
behold
,
my
soul
delighteth
in
plainness
unto
my
people
,
that
they
may
jearn
;
yea
,
and
my
soul
deligiteth
in
the
words
of
Isaiah
,
for
I
came
out
from
Jerusalem
,
and
mine
eyes
hath
beheld
the
things
of
the
Jews
,
and
I
know
that
the
Jews
do
understand
the
things
of
the
gligpphets
,
and
there
is
none
other
people
.
that
understand
the
things
which
were
spoken
unto
the
Jews
,
like
unto
them
,
save
it
be
that
they
arc
taught
afier
the
manner
of
the
things
of
the
Jews
,
But
behold
,
1
Nephi
,
have
not
iaught
my
children
after
the
manner
of
the
Jews
;
but
behold
,
I
,
of
myself
,
have
dwelt
at
Jerusalem
,.
wherefore
I
know
concerning
the
regions
round
about
;
and
1
have
made
mention
unto
my
children
concerning
the
judgments
of
God
,
which
hath
come
to
pass
among
the
Jews
,
unto
my
children
,
according
to
all
that
which
Isaiah
hath
spoken
,
and
I
do
not
write
them
.
But
behold
,
I
proceed
with
mine
own
prophecy
,
according
to
my
plainness
;
in
the
which
,
I
know
that
no
man
can
err
;
nevertheless
,
in
the
days
that
the
prophecies
of
Isatah
shall
be
fulfilled
,
men
shall
know
of
a
surety
,
at
the
times
when
they
shall
come
to
pass
;
wherefore
,
they
are
of
worth
unto
the
children
of
men
,
and
he
that
supposeth
that
they
are
not
,
unto
them
will
l
speak
particularly
,
and
confine
the
words
unto
mine
own
people
:
for
]
know
that
(
hey
shall
be
of
great
worth
unto
them
inthe
last
days
;
for
in
that
day
shall
they
understand
them
;
wherefore
,
for
their
good
have
I
written
them
,
And
as
one
generation
hath
heen
destroyed
among
the
Jews
,
because
of
iniquity
,
even
so
have
they
been
destroyed
,
from
generation
to
generation
,
according
to
their
iniquities
;
and
never
hath
any
of
them
been
destroyed
,
save
it
were
foretold
them
by
the
Prophets
of
the
.
Lord
.
Wherefore
,
it
hath
been
told
them
conceruing
the
destruction
which
should
come
upon
them
,
immediately
after
my
father
left
Jerusalem
;
nevertheless
,
they
hardened
their
hearts
;
and
according
to
my
prophecy
,
they
dave
been
destroyed
,
save
it
be
those
which
are
carried
away
captive
into
Babylon
.
And
now
this
I
speak
because
of
the
[File:108]
spirit
which
isin
me
.
And
notwithstanding
!
that
they
have
becn
carried
away
,
they
shalt
return
again
,
and
possess
the
Jand
of
Jerusalem
;
wherefore
they
shall
be
restored
again
to
the
Iands
of
their
inheritance
.
But
,
behold
,
they
shall
have
.
wars
,
and
rumors
of
wars
;
and
when
the
day
cometh
that
the
enly
begotten
of
the
Father
,
yea
,
even
the
Father
of
heaven
ani
of
earth
,
shall
manifest
himself
unto
them
in
the
flesh
,
behold
,
they
will
reject
him
,
because
of
their
iniquities
,
and
the
hand
.
ness
of
thetr
hearts
,
and
thestiffness
of
their
necks
.
Behold
they
will
crucify
him
,
and
after
that
he
is
laid
in
a
Sepulcher
for
the
space
of
three
days
,
he
shall
rise
from
the
dead
,
with
heal

ing
in
his
wings
,
and
all
they
that
shall
believe
on
his
name
,
shall
be
saved
in
the
Kingdom
of
God
;
wherefore
,
my
soul
de

lighted
to
prophesy
concerning
him
,
for{il
pave
sccn
his
day
,
and
my
heart
doth
maguify
his
holy
name
.
And
behold
it
shall
come
to
pass
,
that
afterthe
Messiah
hath
risen
frou
the
dead
,
ald
hath
manifested
himself
unto
his
ple
,
unto
as
many
as
will
believe
on
his

,
behold
,
Jer
salem
shall
be
destroyed
again
:
for
wo
unto
them
that
fight
against
God
and
the
people
of
his
church
.
Wherefore
,
the
Jews
shall
be
scattered
among
all
nations
;
yea
,
and
:
also
Babylon
shall
be
destroyed
;
wherefore
,
the
.
Jews
shall
he
scattered
by
other
nations
;
and
after
that
Ahey
have
been
scattered
,
and
the
Lord
God
hath
scourged
them
by
other
nations
,
for
the
space
of
many
generations
,
yea
,
even
down
from
generation
to
generation
,
until
they
shall
be
persuaded
to
believe
in
Christ
,
the
Son
of
God
,
and
the
atonement
,
which
is
infinite
for
all
mankind
;
and
when
that
day
shall
come
;
that
they
shall
believe
in
Christ
,
und
worship
the
father
in
hig
name
,
with
pure
hearts
,
and
clean
hands
,
and
look
not
for
ward
any
more
for
another
Messiah
,
then
,
at
that
time
,
the
day
will
come
that
it
must
needs
be
expedient
that
they
should
believe
these
things
,
and
the
Lord
will
sct
his
hand
again
the
sec
ond
time
to
restore
his
people
from
their
lost
and
fallen
state
Wherefore
,
he
will
proceed
to
do
a
marvelous
work
,
anda
wonder
among
the
children
of
men
,
Wherefore
,
he
shall
bring
forth
his
words
unto
them
,
which
words
shall
judge
them
at
the
last
day
,
for
they
shall
be
given
them
for
the
purpose
of
convincing
them
of
the
true
Messiah
,
who
was
rejected
by
them
;
and
unto
the
convincing
of
them
that
they
need
not
look
forward
any
more
for
a
Messiah
to
come
,
for
there
should
not
any
come
,
save
it
shOuld
be
a
false
Messiah
,
which
should
deecive
tbe
people
:
for
there
is
save
[File:109]
ane
Messiah
spoken
of
by
the
Prophets
,
and
that
Messiah
is
he
which
should
be
rejected
of
the
Jews
.
For
according
to
the
words
of
the
Prophets
,
the
Messiah
cometh
in
six
bundren
years
fromthe
tine
that
my
father
Jeft
Jerusalem
;
and
according
to
the
words
of
the
Prophets
,
and
also
the
word
of
the
Angel
of
God
,
his
name
shall
be
Jesus
Christ
the
Son
of
God
.
And
now
my
brethren
,
have
spoken
plain
,
that
ye
cannot
err
;
and
as
the
Lord
God
liveth
,
that
brought
Israel
up
out
ef
the
jand
of
Exypt
,
and
gave
unto
Moses
power
that
he
should
heal
the
nations
,
after
that
they
had
been
bitten
by
the
poisonous
serpents
,
if
they
would
cast
their
eyes
unto
the
serpent
which
he
did
raise
.
up
before
them
,
and
elso
gaye
him
power
that
he
should
smite
the
rock
,
and
the
water
should
come
forth
;
yea
,
behold
say
unto
ypu
that
as
these
things
are
rue
,
and
as
the
Lord
God
liveth
,
there
is
none
other
name
given
under
heaven
,
save
it
be
this
Jesus
Christ
of
which
I
have
spoken
,
whereby
man
can
be
saved
.
Wherefore
,
for
this
cause
hath
the
Lord
God
promised
unto
me
that
these
things
which
write
,
shalkbe
kept
and
preserved
,
and
handed
down
unto
my
seed
,
from
generation
to
generation
,
that
the
promise
may
be
fulfilled
unto
Joseph
,
that
his
seed
should
never
perish
as
long
as
the
earth
should
stand
,
Wherefore
,
these
things
shal
)
go
from
.
generation
to
generation
,
as
long
as
the
earth
shall
stand
;
and
they
shall
go
according
to
the
will
and
pleasure
of
God
;
and
the
nations
which
skall
possess
them
,
shall
be
judged
of
them
according
to
the
words
which
are
written
;
for
we
labor
diligently
to
write
,
to
persuade
our
children
,
and
also
our
brethren
,
to
belicve
in
Christ
,
and
to
be
reconciled
to
God
;
for
we
know
that
it
is
by
grace
that
we
are
saved
,
after
all
that
we
can
do
,
And
notwithstanding
we
believe
in
Christ
,
we
keep
the
law
of
Moses
,
and
look
forward
with
steadfastness
unto
Christ
,
untithe
law
shalt
be
fulfilled
;
for
,
for
this
end
was
the
law
given
;
wherefore
,
the
law
hath
become
dead
unto
us
,
and
we
are
made
alive
in
Christ
,
because
of
our
faith
;
yet
,
we
keep
the
law
because
of
the
commandments
;
and
we
talk
of
Christ
,
we
rejoice
in
Christ
,
we
preach
of
Christ
,
we
prophesy
of
Christ
,
and
we
write
according
to
our
prophecies
,
that
our
children
may
know
to
what
source
they
may
look
for
a
remission
of
their
sins
,
Wherefore
,
we
speak
concerning
the
law
,
that
our
children
may
know
the
deadness
of
the
law
;
and
they
,
by
knowing
the
deadnes
of
the
law
,
may
look
forward
un%
that
life
which
is
in
Christ
,
and
know
for
what
end
the
law
:
[File:110]
was
given
.
And
after
that
,
the
Jawis
fulfilled
in
Christ
,
thy
they
necd
not
harden
their
hearts
against
him
,
when
the
lay
had
ought
to
be
done
away
.
:
And
now
behold
,
my
people
,
ye
are
a
stiffnecked
people
,
wherefore
,
Ihave
spoken
plain
unto
you
,
that
ye
cannot
mis

understand
.
And
the
words
which
I
have
spoken
,
shall
stan
)
asa
testimony
against
you
:
for
they
are
sufficient
to
teach
a
man
the
right
way
;
for
the
right
way
is
to
believe
in
Chris
)
and
deny
chim
not
;
for
by
denying
him
,
ye
also
deny
the
Prophets
and
the
law
.
And
now
behold
1
say
unto
you
,
that
the
right
way
is
fc
believe
in
Christ
,
and
deny
him
not
;
and
Christ
is
the
Hol
One
of
Israel
:
wherefore
ye
must
bow
down
before
him
,
anj
worship
him
with
all
your
might
,
mindjfand
strength
,
and
on
whole
soul
;
and
if
ye
do
this
,
ye
shall
in
nowise
be
cast
out
And
inasmuch
as
it
shall
be
expedient
,
ye
must
keep
the
pe

fermances
and
ordinances
of
God
,
until
the
law
shall
be
{ub
filled
which
was
given
wnto
Moses
,
And
after
thateChrist
shall
have
risen
from
the
dead
,
ls
shall
shew
himself
unto
you
,
my
children
,
and
my
belovel
brethren
;
and
the
words
which
he
shall
speak
unto
you
,
shal
be
the
law
which
ye
shall
do
,
For
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
thi
{have
beheld
thei
many
generations

pass
away
,
and
ther
shail

great
wars
and
contentions
among

Ani
alter
that
the
Messiah
shall
come
,
there
shall
be
signs
given
unly
my
people
of
his
birth
,
and
also
of
his
death
and
resurrection
and
great
and
terrible
shall
that
day
be
unto
the
wicked
;
fo
they
shall
perish
;
and
they
perish
because
,
they
cast
out
the

and
the

,
and
stone
them
,
and
slay
them
:
wherefore

for
the

[File:111]
@
the
pain
,
and
the
anguish
of
my
soul
for'
the
loss
of
the
glain
of
my
people
!
For
i
,
Nephi
,
hath
seen
it
,
and
it
well
nigh
cousumeth
me
before
the
presence
of
the
Lord
;
but
1
must
cry
unto
my
God
,
thy
ways
are
just
.
But
behold
,
the
righteous
,
that
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
prophets
,
and
destroy
them
not
,
but
look
forward
unto
Christ
with
steadfastness
for
the
signs
which
are
given
,
notwithstanding
all
persecations
;
behold
they
are
they
which'
shall
not
perish
.
But
the
Sen
of
righteousness
shall
appear
unto
them
;
and
he
shall
heal
them
,
and
they
shall
have
peace
with
him
,
until
three
generations
shall
have
passed
away
,
and
many
of
the
fourth
generation
shall
have
passed
away
in
righteousness
.—
And
when
these
things
shall
have
passed
away
,
a
speedy
destraction
cometh
untofmy
people
;
for
,
riotwithstanding
the
pains
of
my
soul
,
I
have
seen
it
;
wherefore
,
I
know
that
it
shall
come
to
pass
;
and
they
sell
themselves
for
nought
;
for
,
for
ihe
reward
of
their
pride
,
and
their
foclishness
,
they
shall
reap
destruction
;
for
because
they
yieldeth
unto
the
Devil
,
and
choose
works
of
darkness
rather
than
light
;
therefore
they
must
go
down
to
hell
,
for
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
will
not
always
strive
with
man
.
And
when
the
spirit
ceaseth
to
strive
with
man
,
then
cometh
speedy
destruction
;
and
this
grieveth
my
soul
.
And
as
{
spate
concerning
the
convineing
of
the
Jews
,
that
Jesus
is
the
very
Christ
,
it
must
needs
be
,
that
the
Gentiles
be
convinced
also
,
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
,
the
Eternal
God
;
and
that
he
manifesteth
himself
unto
all
they
that
believe
in
him
,
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;
yea
,
unto
every
nation
,
kindred
,
tongue
,
and
people
,
working
mighty
miracles
,
signs
and
wonders
,
amony
the
children
of
men
,
according
to
their
faith
.
But
behold
prophesy
unto
you
concerning
the
last
days
;
concerning
the
days
when
the
Lord
God
shall
bring
these
things
forth
unto
the
children
of
men
.
After
that
my
seed
and
the
seed
of
my
brethren
shall
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
,
and
shall
have
been
smitten
by
the
Gentiles
;
yea
,
after
that
the
Lord
God
shall
have
camped
against
them
round
about
,
and
shall
have
laid
siege
against
them
with
a
mount
,
and
raised
forts
against
them
;
and
after
that
they
shall
-
bave
been
brought
down
low
into
the
dust
,
even
that
they
are
not
,
yet
the
words
of
the
righteous
shall
be
written
,
and
the
prayers
of
the
faithful
shall
be
heard
,
and
all
they
which
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
,
shall
not
be
forgotten
;
for
,
they
which
shali
be
destroyed
shall
speak
unto
them
out
of
the
ground
,
and
their
speech
shall
[File:112]
be
low
out
of
the
dust
,
and
their
voice
shall
be
as
one
that
hath
a
familiar
spirit
;
for
the
Lord
God
will
give
unto
hig
power
,
that
he
may
whisper
concerning
them

out
of
the
ground
;
and
their
speech
shall
whisper
out
of
ty
dust
.
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
God
:
They
shall
write
the
thi
which
shall
be
done
among
them
,
and
they
shall
be
written
ang
sealed
up
in
a
book
,
and
they
that
have
dwindled
in
unbeli
shall
not
have
them
,
for
they
seek
to
destroy
the
things
gf
God
:
wherefore
,
as
they
which
have
heen
destroyed
,
hay
been
destroyed
speedily
;
and
the
multitude
of
their
terribk
ones
,
shail
be
as
chaff
that
passeth
away
.
Yea
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
God
:
It
shall
be
at
an
instant
,
suddenly
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
,
that
they
which
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
,
shall
be
smitten
by
the
han@
of
the
Gentiles
.
Ang
the
Gentiles
are
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
eyes
,
and
hay
stumbled
,
heeause
of
the
greatness
of
their
stumbling
block
,
that
they
have
built
up
many
Churches
i
Nevertheless
they
pui_
down
the
power
and
the
miracles
of
God
,
and
preach
up
uto
themselves
,
their
own
wisdom
,
and
their
own
learning
,
that
they
may
get
gain
,
and
grind
upon
the
face
of
the
poor
;
ani
there
are
many
churches
built
up
which
causeth
envyings
,
an
strifes
,
and
malice
;
and
there
are
also
secret
combinations
,
even
as
in
times
of
old
,
according
to
the
combinations
of
the
Devil
,
for
he
is
the
founder
of
all
these
things
;
yea
,
the
four
der
of
murder
,
and
works
of
darkness
;
yea
,
and
he
leaded
them
by
the
neck
with
a
flaxen
cord
,
until
he
bindeth
then
with
his
strong
cords
forever
.
Por
behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
say
unio
you
,
that
the
Lord
God
worketh
not
in
darkness
.
He
doeth
not
any
thing
save
it
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
world
;
for
he
loveth
the
world
,
even
that
he
layeth
down
his
own
life
,
that
he
may
draw
al
men
unto
him
.
Wherefore
,
he
commandeth
none
that
they
shalt
not
partake
of
his
salvation
.
Behold
,
doth
he
ery
unto
any
,
saying
,
Depart
from
me
?
Behold
,
I'say
unto
you
,
ney
;
but
he
saith
,
Come
unto
me
all
ye
ends
of
the
earth
,
buy
milk
and
honey
,
without
money
,
and
without
price
.
Behold
,
hath
he
commanded
any
that
they
should
depart
out
of
the
Synagogues
,
or
out
of
the
houses
of
worship
?
Behold
,
f
say
unto
you
,
nay
.
Hath
he
commanded
any
that
they
should
no
!
partake
of
his
salvation
?
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
;
but
he
hath
given
it
free
for
all
men
;
and
he
hath
commanded
his
people
that
they
should
persuade
all
men
unto
repentance
.
Ahold
,
hath
the
Lord
commanded
any
that
they
should
vol
[File:113]
yartake
of
his
goodness
?
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
;
but'
all
men
ave
privileged
the
one
like
unto
the
other
,
and
none
are
forvidden
.
He
commandeth
that
there
shall
be
no
priestcrafts
;
for
,
behold
,
priest
-
crafts
are
that
men
preach
and
set
themselves
up
for
a
light
unto
the
world
,
that
they
may
get
gain
,
and
praise
of
the
world
;
but
they
seek
not
the
welfare
of
Zion
.
Behold
,
the
Lord
hath
forbidden
this
thing
;
wherefore
,
the
Lord
God
hath
given
a
commandment
,
that
alt
men
should
have
charity
,
which
charity
is
love
.
And
except
they
should
have
charity
,
they
were
nothing
:
wherefore
,
if
they
should
have
charity
,
they
would
not
suffer
the
laborer
in
Zion
fo
perish
.
But
the
laborer
in
Zion
,
shall
labor
for
Zion
;
for
if
they
lahor
for
money
,
they
shall
perish
.
And
,
again
,
the
Lord
God
hath
commanded
that
men
should
not
murder
;
that
that
they
should
not
lie
;
that
they
should
not
steal
;
that
they
should
not
take
the
name
of
the
Lord
their
God
in
vain
;
that
they
should
not
envy
;
that
they
should
not
have
malice
;
that
they
should
not
contend
one
with
another
;
that
they
should
not
commit
whoredoms
;
and
that
they
should
do
none
of
these
things
;
for
whoso
doeth
them
,
shall
perish
;
for
none
of
these
iniquities
come
of
the
Lord
;
for
he
doeth
that
whiclris
good
ainong
the
children
of
men
;
and
he
doeth
nothing
save
it
be
plain
unto
the
children
of
men
;
and
he
inviteth
them
all
to
come
unfo
him
,
and
partake
of
his
goodness
;
and
he
denicth
none
that
come
unto
him
,
black
and
white
,
bond
and
free
,
male
and
female
;
and
he
remembercth
the
heathen
,
and
all
are
alike
unto
God
,
both
Jew
and
Gentile
.
But
,
behold
,
in
the
last
days
,
or
in
the
days
of
the
Gentiles
;
yea
,
behold
all
the
nations
af
the
Gentiles
,
and
also
the
Jews
,
both
they
which
shall
come
upon
this
land
,
and
they
which
shall
be
upon
other
tands
;
yea
,
even
upon
all
the
lands
of
the
earth
;
behold
,
they
will
be
drunken
with
iniquity
,
and
all
manner
of
abominations
;
and
when
that
day
shall
come
,
they
shall
be
visited
of
the
Lord
of
hosts
,
with
thunder
and
with
earthquake
,
and
with
a
great
noise
,
and
with
storm
and
tempest
,
and
with
the
flame
of
devouring
fire
;
and
all
the
nations
that
fight
against
Zion
,
and
that
distress
her
,
shall
be
as
a
dream
of
a
night
vision
;
yea
,
it
shall
be
unto
them
,
even
as
unto
a
hungry
man
,
which
dreameth
,
and
behold
he
eateth
,
but
he
awaketh
and
his
soul
is
empty
;
or
like
unto
a
thirsty
man
,
which
dreameth
,
and
.
behold
he
drinketh
,
but
he
awaketh
,
and
behold
he
is
faint
,
and
his
soul
hath
appetite
;
yea
,
even
so
shall
the
multitude
of
all
the
naHons
be
that
fight
against
mount
Zion
:
for
behold
,
all
.
ye
that
[File:114]
do
iniquity
,
stay
yourselves
and
wonder
,
for
ye
shall
cry
oy
,
and
ery
;
yea
,
ye
shall
be
drunken
,
but
not
with
wine
;
ye
shell
stagger
,
but
not
with
strong
drink
:
for
bebold
,
the
Lord
bath
poured
out
upon
you
,
the
spirit
of
deep
sleep
.
For
behold
,
ye
haye
closed
your
eyes
,
and
ye
have
rejected
the
Prophets
,
ang
your
rulers
,
and
the
seers
hath
he
coyered
because
of
you
iniguities
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
,
that
the
Lord
God
:
shall
bri
forth
unto
you
,
the
words
of
a
book
,
and
they
shall
be
the
words
of
them
which
have
slumbered
.
—
And
behold
,
the
book
shalj
be
sealed
;
and
in
the
book
shall
be
a
revelation
from
God
,
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
,
to
the
ending
thereof
,
Wherefore
,
because
of
the
things
which
are
sealed
up
,
the
things
which
are
sealed
,
shall
not
be
delivered
in
the
day
of
the
wickednes
and
abominations
of
the
people
.
Wherefore
the
bool
:
shall
be
kept
from
them
.
But
the
book
shall
be
delivered
unto
4
Man
,
and
he
shall
deliver
the
words
of
the
book
,
which
are
the
words
of
they
which
have
s
!
umbered
in
the
dust
;
and
he
shall
deliver
these
words
unto
another
;
but
the
words
which
are
scaled
,
he
shall
not
deliver
,
neither
shall
be
deliver
th
book
.
For
the
hook
shall
be
sealed
by
the
power
of
God
,
and
the
revelation
which
was
sealed
,
shall
be
kept
in
the
book
until
the
own
due
time
of
the
Lord
,
that
they
may
come
forth
:
for
,
behold
,
they
reveal
all
things
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
,
unto
the
end
thereof
.
And
the
day
cometh
that
the
words
of
the
book
which
were
sealed
,
shall
be
read
upon
the
house
-
tops
;
and
they
shall
be
read
by
the
power
of
Christ
;
and
all
things
shall
be
revealed
unto
the
children
of
men
which
eyer
hath
been
among
the
children
of
men
,
and
which
ever
will
be
,
even
unto
the
end
of
the
earth
.
Wherefore
,
at
that
day
when
the
book
shall
be
delivered
unto
the
man
of
whoml
have
spoken
,
the
book
shall
be
hid
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
,
that
the
eyes
of
none
shall
behold
it
,
save
it
be
that
three
wik
nesses
shall
behold
it
,
by
the
power
of
God
,
besides
him
whom
the
book
shall
be
delivered
;
and
they
shall
testify
the
truth
of
the
book
,
and
the
things
therein
.
And
there
is
none
other
which
shall
view
il
,
save
it
be
a
few
,
according
to
the
will
of
God
,
to
bear
testimony
of
his
word
unto
the
chik
dren
of
men
:
for
the
Lord
God
hath
said
,
that
the
words
@
the
faithful
should
speak
as
if
it
were
from
the
dead
.
Where
fore
,
the
Lord
God
will
proceed
to
bring
forth
the
words
af
the
book
;
and
in
the
mouth
of
as
many
witnesses
as
seemeth
[File:115]
him
good
,
will
he
establish
bis
word
:
and
wo
be
unto
him
that
rejecteth
the
word
of
God
.
But
behold
,
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
Lord
God
shall
say
unto
him
to
whom
he
shall
deliver
the
book
,
Take
these
words
which
are
not
sealed
,
and
deliver
them
to
another
,
that
he
may
shew
them
unto
the
learned
,
saying
:
Read
this
,
}
pray
thee
.
And
the
learned
shall
say
,
Bring
hither
the
book
,
and
I
will
read
them
:
and
now
,
because
of
the
glory
of
the
world
,
and
to
get
gain
,
will
they
say
this
,
and
not
for
the
glory
of
God
.
And
the
man
shall
say
,
I
cannot
bring
the
book
,
for
it
is
sealed
.
Then
shall
the
learned
say
,
I
cannot
read
it
.
Where~
fore
it
shall
come
to
pass
,
that
the
Lord
God
will
deliver
again
the
book
and
the
words
thereof
,
to
him
that
is
not
learned
;
and
the
man
that
is
not
learned
,
shall
say
,
1
am
not
learned
.
Then
shat]
the
Lord
God
say
unto
him
,
The
learned
shall
not
read
them
,
for
they
have
rejected
them
,
and
I
am
ale
to
do
mine
own
work
;
wherefore
,
thou
shalt
read
the
werds
which
Ishall
give
unto
thee
.
Fouch
not
the
things
which
are
sealed
,
for
I
will
bring
them
forth
in
minc
own
due
time
:
for
I
will
shew
unto
the
children
of
men
,
that
I
am
able
to
do
mine
wn
work
,
Wherefore
,
when
thou
hast
read
the
words
which
Ihave
commanded
thee
,
and
obtained
the
witnesses
which
T
have
promistd
unto
thee
,
then
shalt
thou
seal
up
the
book
again
,
and
hide
it
up
unto
me
,
that
I
may
preserve
the
words
which
thou
hast
not
read
,
until
I
shall
see
fit
in
mine
own
wisdom
,
to
reveal
all'
things
unto
the
children
of
men
.
For
bebold
,
1am
God
;
and
Tam
a
God
of
miracles
;
and
I
will
shew
unto
the
world
that
I
am
the
same
yesterday
,
to-day
,
and
forever
;
and
I
work
not
among
the
children
of
men
,
save
it
be
according
to
their
faith
.
And
again
it
shall
come
to
pass
,
that
the
Lord
shall
say
unto
him
that
shall
read
the
words
that
shall
be
delivered
him
,
For
asmuch
as
this
people
draw
near
unto
me
with
their
mouth
,
and
with
their
hps
do
honor
me
,
but
have
removed
their
hearts
far
from
me
,
and
their
fear
towards
me
is
taught
by
the
precepts
of
men
,
therefore
,
1
will
proceed
to
do
a
marvellous
work
among
this
people
;
yea
,
a
marvellous
work
,
and
a
wonder
:
for
the
wisdom
of
their
wise
and
learned
shall
perish
,
aud
the
understanding
of
their
prudent
shall
be
hid
.
And
wo
unto
them
that
seek
deep
to
hide
their
counsel
from
the
Lord
,
And
their
works
are
in
the
dark
;
and
they
say
,
Who
seeth
:
us
;
and
who
knoweth
us
?
And
they
also
say
,
Surely
,
your
turning
of
has
upside
down
,
shall
be
esteemed
as
the
pot
[File:116]
ter's
clay
.
But
behold
,
I
will
shew
unto
them
,
saith
the
of
Hosts
,
that
{
know
all
their
works
.
For
shall
the
work
of
him
that
made
it
,
He
made
me
not
?
Or
,
shall
the
thing
fig
med
say
of
him
that
framed
it
,
He
had
no
understanding
?
behold
,
saith
the
Lord
of
Hosts
,
1
will
shew
unto
the
chil
of
men
,
that
itis
not
yet
a
very
little
while
,
and
Lebanon
gh
be
turned
into
a
fruitful
field
;
and
the
fruitful
field
shall
esteemed
asa
forest
.
And
in
that
day
shall
the
deaf
hear
t}
words
of
the
book
;
and
the
eyes
of
the
blind
shall
see
out
obscurity
and
out
of

;
and
the
meek
also
shall
j
crease

and
their
joy
shall
be
in
the
Lord
;
and
the
poor
amo

shall
rejoice
in
the
Holy

of
Israel

For

;
wherefore

dcnow
that
they

The

For

Behold

unto

That
I

that
the

forth
out
of

unto

which

And
because
my

many
of

say

A

we

any

saith

:
O

,
they
shall
have
a
Bible
;
and
it
shall
proceed
forth
from
the
Jews

And
what
thank
they
the
Jews
for
the
Bible
which
they
receive
from

?
Yea
,
what
do
the
Gentiles
mean
?
Do
they
remember
the

the
labors

of

their

O

Nay

but
ye
have
cursed
them
,
and
have
hated
them
,
and
have
not
sought
to

them
.
But
behold

I
will
return
all
these
things
upon

for

the

when

And
now
,
behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
would
speak
unio
you
:
for
I
,
Nephi
,
would
not
suffer
that
ye
should
suppas
that
ye
are
more
righteous
than
the
Gentiles
shall
be
.
Vor
behold
,
except
ye
shall
keep
the
commandinents
of
God
,
y
shall
all
likewise
perish
;
and
because
of
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
,
ye
need
not
suppose
that
the
Gentiles
are
utterly
destroyed
.
For
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
as
many
of
the
Ger
[File:121]
{les
us
will
repent
,
are
the
covenant
people
of
the
Lord
;
and
as
many
of
the
Jews
as
will
not
repent
,
shall
be
cast
off
:
for
the
Lord
covenanteth
with
none
,
save
it
be
with
them
that
reent
and
believe
in
his
Son
,
which
is
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
.
And
now
,
J
would
prophesy
somewhat
more
concerning
the
Jews
and
the
Gentiles
.
For
after
the
book
of
which
J
have
spoken
shall
come
forth
,
and
be
written
unto
the
Geatiles
,
and
sealed
up
again
unto
the
Lord
,
there
shall
be
many
which
shali
believe
the
words
which
are
written
;
and
they
shall
carry
them
forth
unto
the
remnant
of
our
seed
.
And
then
shall
the
remnant
of
our
seed
know
concerning
us
,
how
that
we
came
out
from
Jerusalem
,
and
that
they
are
a
descendant
of
the
Jews
,
And
the
Gospel
of
Jesus
Christ
shall
be
declared
among
them
;
wherefore
,
they
shall
be
restored
unto
the
knowledge
of
their
fathers
,
and
also
to
the
knowledge
of
Jesus
Christ
,
which
was
had
among
their
fathers
.
And
then
shall
they
re~
joice
:
for
they
shall
know
that
it
is
a
blessing
unto
them
from
the
hand
of
God
;
and
their
seales
of
darkness
shall
hegin
to
fall
from
their
eyes
;
and
many
generations
shall
not
pass
away
among
them
,
save
they
shall
be
a
white
and
a
delightsome
people
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
Jews
which
are
scattered
,
also
shall
begin
to
believe
in
Christ
;
and
they
shall
begin
to
gather
in
upon
the
face
of
the
land
;
and
as
many
as
shall
believe
in
Christ
,
shall
also
become
a
delightsome
people
.
And
it
shall
come
to

and

,
to
bring
about
the
restoration
of
his

And
with
righteousness
shall
the
Lord
God
judge
the
poor
,
and
reprove
with
equity
,
for
the
meek
of
the
earth
,
And
he
shall
smite
the
carth
with
the
rod
of
his
mouth
;
and
with
the
breath
of
his
lips
shall
he
slay
the
wicked
:
for
the
time
speedily
cometh
,
that
the
Lord
God
shall
cause
a
great
division

and
the

he
will
spare

even

And
righteousness

And
then

and
the

together
;
and

them
.
And
the

the

shall
feed
;
their

shall
lie

;
and

lion
shall
eat

And
the
sucking
child
shall
play
on

hole
of

and
the
weaned
child
[File:122]
shall
put
his

cockatrice's
den

They
shall
ng
burt
nor

for
the
earth
shal]
be
full
of
the
knowledge

Wherefore

all

be
made
known
unto

There

Wherefore

CHAPTER
XIII
.
Anp
now
T
,
Nephi
,
make
an
end
of
my
prophesying
unig
,
you
,
my
beloved
brethren
.
And
I
cannot
write
but
a
fey
things
,
which
J
know
must
surely
come
to
pass
;
neither
em
1
write
but
a
few
of
the
words
of
my
brother
Jacob
.
Where
fore
,
the
things
which
I
have
written
,
sufficeth
me
,
save
it
ber
few
words
which
I
must
speak
,
concerning
the
doctrine
di
Christ
;
wherefore
,
I
shall
speak
unto
you
plainly
,
according
to
the
plainnesa
of
my
prophesying
.
For
roy
son
!
delightett
in
plainness
:
for
after
this
manner
doth
the
Lord
God
work
among
the
children
of
men
.
For
the
Lord
God
giveth
lieht
unto
the
understanding
:
for
he
speaketh
unto
men
according
to
their
language
,
unto
their
understanding
.
Wherefore
,
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
1
baye
spoken
unto
you
,
concerning
that
Prophet
which
the
Lord
showed
unto
me
,
tht
should
baptize
the
Lamb
of
God
,
which
should
take
away
tle
sins
of
the
world
.
And
now
,
if
the
Lamb
of
God
,
he
being
holy
,
should
have
need
to
be
baptized
by
water
,
to
fulfil
all
righteousness
,
O
then
,
how
mnch
more
need
have
we
,
being
unholy
,
to
be
haptizei
,
yea
,
even
by
water
.
And
now
,
I
would
ask
of
you
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
wherein
the
Lamb
of
God
did
fulfil
all
righteousness
in
being
baptized
by
water
?
Know
ye
not
that
he
was
holy
!
But
notwithstanding
he
being
holy
,
he
showeth
unto
the
chit
dren
of
men
,
that
according
to
the
flesh
,
he
humblcth
himself
tefore
the
Father
,
and
witnesseth
unto
the
Father
that
le
[File:123]
sould
be
obedient
unto
him
in
keeping
his
commandments
;
wherefore
,
after
that
he
was
baptized
with
water
,
the
Holy
Ghost
descended
upon
him
in
the
form
of
a
dove
.
And
again
:
It
sheweth
unto
the
children
of
men
the
straightness
of
the
path
,
and
the
narrowness
of
the
gate
,
by
which
they
should
enter
,
he
having
set
the
example
before
them
.
And
he
saith
unto
the
children
of
men
,
Follow
thou
me
.
Wherefore
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
can
we
follow
Jesus
,
save
we
shall
be
willing
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
Father
?
And
the
Wather
saith
,
Repent
ye
,
repent
ye
,
and
be
baptized
in
the
name
of
my
beloved
Son
.
And
also
,
the
voice
of
the
Son
came
unto
me
,
saying
,
He
that
is
baptized
in
my
name
,
to
him
will
the
Father
vive
the
Holy
Ghost
,
like
unto
me
;
wherefore
,
follow
me
,
and
do
the
things
which
ye
have
seenmedo
,
Wherefore
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
know
that
if
ye
shall
follow
the
Son
,
with
full
purpose
of
heart
,
acting
no
hypocrisy
and
no
deception
before
God
,
but
with
real
intent
,
repenting
of
your
sins
,
Witnessing
unto
the
Father
that
ye
are
willing
to
take
upon
you
the
name
of
Christ
,
by
baptism
;
yea
,
by
following
your
Lord
and
Saviour
down
into
the
water
,
according
to
his
word
;
behold
,
then
shall
ye
receive
the
Holy
Ghost
;
yea
,
then
.
cometh
the
baptism
of
fire
and
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;
and
then
can
ye
speak
with
the
tongue
of
Angels
,
and
shout
praises
unto
the
Holy
Onc
of
Israel
.
But
behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
thus
came
the
voiee
of
the
Son
unto
me
,
saying
,
After
that
ye
have
repented
of
your
sins
,
and
witnessed
unto
the
Father
that
ye
are
willing
to
keep
my
commandments
,
by
the
baptism
of
water
,
and
have
received
the
baptism
of
fire
and
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
and
can
speak
with
a
new
tongue
,
yea
,
even
with
the
tongue
of
Angels
,
and
after
this
,
should
deny
me
,
it
would
have
been
better
for
you
,
that
ye
had
not
known
me
.
And
I
heard
a
voice
from
the
Father
,
saying
,
Yea
,
the
words
of
my
beloved
,
are
trac
and
faithful
.
He
that
endureth
to
the
end
,
the
same
shall
be
saved
,
And
now
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
know
by
this
,
that
unless
a
man
shal]
endure
to
the
end
,
in
following
the
example
of
the
Son
of
the
living
God
,
he
cannot
be
saved
;
wherefore
,
do
the
things
which
I
have
told
you
that
I
have
seen
,
that
your
Lord
and
your
Redeemer
sould
do
;
for
,
for
this
cause
have
they
been
shown
unto
,
me
,
that
ye
might
know
the
gate
by
which
ye
should
enter
.
For
the
gate
_
by
which
ye
should
enter
,
is
repentance
,
and
baptism
by
water
F
and
then
cometh
a
remission
of
your
sins
by
fire
,
and
by
the
~
[File:124]
Holy
Ghost
.
And
then
are
ye
in
this
straight
and
narrow
pay
which
leads
to
eternal
life
;
yea
,
ye
have
entered
in
by
the
gate
:
ye
have
done
according
to
the
commandments
of
Hather
and
the
Son
;
and
ye
have
received
the
Holy
Ghog
,
which
witness
of
the
Father
and
the
Son
,
unto
the
fulfilling
g
the
promise
which
he
hath
made
,
That
if
ye
entered
in
by
th
:
way
,
ye
should
receive
.
And
now
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
after
that
ye
have
got
iny
this
straight
and
narrow
path
,
I
would
ask
,
If
all
is
done
?
By
.
hold
,
Tsay
unto
you
,
Nay
;
for
ye
have
not
come
thus
far
,
save
it
were
by
the
word
of
Christ
,
with
unshaken
faith
in
him
,
relying
wholly
upon
the
merits
of
Him
who
is
mighty
to
save
;
wherefore
,
yc
must
press
forward
with
a
steadfastness
jp
Christ
,
having
a
perfect
brightness
of
hope
,
and
a
love
of
Gad
and
of
all
men
,
Wherefore
,
if
ye
shall
press
forward
,
feat
ing
upon
the
word
of
Christ
,
and
endure
to
the
end
,
behold
thus
saith
the
Father
:
Ye
shall
have
eternal
life
.
And
now
,
behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
this
is
the
way
;
and
there
is
none
other
way
nor
name
given
under
heaven
,
wherely
man
can
be
saved
in
the
Kingdom
of
God
.
And
now
,
behold
,
_
this
is
the
doctrine
of
Christ
,
and
the
only
and
true
—
_
of
the
Father
,
and
of
the

and
of

CHAPTER
XIY
,
Ann
now
,
behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
suppose
that
ye
ponder
somewhat
in
your
hearts
,
concerning
that
which
3
should
do
,
aflet
that
ye
have
entered
in
by
the
way
.
But
be
hold
,
why
do
ye
ponder
these
things
in
your
hearts
?
Do
ye
nd
remember
thet
I
said
unto
you
,
that
afier
ye
had
received
the
Holy
Ghost
,
ye
could
speak
with
the
tongue
of
Angels
?
And
now
,
how
could
ye
speak
with
the
tongue
of
Angejs
,
save
il
were
hy
the
Holy
Ghost
?
Angels
speak
by
the
power
of
the
Uoly
Ghost
;
wherefore
,
they
speak
the
words
of
Christ
Wherefore
,
I
said
unto
you
,
feast
upon
the
words
of
Christ
:
for
behold
,
the
words
of
Christ
will
tell
you
all
things
what
ye
should
do
,
Wherefore
,
now
efter
that
I
have
spoken
thest
words
,
if
ye
cannot
understand
them
,
it
will
be
because
ye
ask
not
,
neither
do
ye
knock
;
wherefore
,
ye
are
not
brought
inte
the
light
,
but
must
perish
jn
the
dark
,
Wor
behold
,
again
I
)
[File:125]
gay
unto
you
,
that
if
ye
will
enter
in
by
the
way
,
and
receive
the
Holy
Ghost
,
it
will
shew
unto
you
all
things
what
ye
should
do
.
Behold
,
this
is
the
doctrine
of
Christ
;
and
there
will
be
no
more
doctrine
given
,
until
after
that
he
shall
manifest
him
self
unto
you
in
the
flesh
,
And
when
he
shall
manifest
hims
self
unto
you
in
the
flesh
,
the
things
which
he
shall
say
unte
you
,
shall
ye
ohserve
to
do
.
And
now
J
,
Nephi
,
cannot
say
more
:
the
spirit
stoppeth
mine
utterance
,
and
I
am
left
to
mourn
because
of
the
unbehef
,
and
the
wickedness
,
and
the
ignorance
,
and
ihe
stif
-
neckedness
of
men
:
for
they
will
not
search
knowledge
,
nor
understand
great
knowledge
,
when
it
is
given
unto
them
ip
plainness
,
even
as
plain
as
word
can
be
.
And
now
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
perceive
that
ye
ponder
still
in
your
hearts
;
and
it
grieveth
me
that
Imust
speak
concerning
this
thing
.
For
if
ye
would
hearken
unto
the
spirit
which
teacheth
a
man
to
pray
,
ye
would
know
that
ye
must
pray
:
for
the
evil
spirit
teacheth
not
a
man
to
pray
,
but
teachcth
him
that
he
must
not
pray
.
But
behold
,
1
say
unto
you
,
that
ye
must
pray
always
,
and
not
faint
;
that
ye
must
not
perform
any
thing
unto
the
Lord
,
save
in
the
first
place
ye
shalt
pray
unto
the
Father
in
the
name
of
Christ
,
that
he
will
consecrate
thy
performance
unto
thee
,
that
thy
performance
may”
he
for
the
welfare
of
thy
soul
.
CHAPTER
XY
.
Ann
now
I
,
Nephi
,
cannot
write
all
the
things
which
were
taught
among
my
people
;
neither
am
I
mighty
in
writing
,
like
unto
speaking
:
for
when
a
man
speaketh
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
carrieth
-
it
unto
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
.
But
behold
,
tlere
are
many
that
harden
their
hearts
against
the
[oly
Spirit
,
that
it
hath
no
.
place
in
them
;
wherefore
,
they
cast
many
things
away
which
are
written
,
and
esteem
them
as
things
of
nought
.
But]
,
Nepli
,
have
written
what
I
baye
written
;
and
I
esteem
it
as
of
great
worth
,
and
especially
unto
my
people
.
For
1
pray
continually
for
them
by
day
,
and
mince
eyes
water
my
pillow
by
night
,
because
of
them
;
and
I
cry
unto
my
God
in
faith
,
and
I
know
that
he
will
hear
myery
;
and
I
know
that
the
Lord
God
wul
conscerate
my
prayers
,
fer
the
gain
of

people
,
And

the

And
it
speaketh

I

But

for

I

except

which

and

antil

And

Bie
words
of
his
preaching
unto
his
brethren

He

:
eth
a
man
who
secketh
to
overthrow
the
doctrine
of
Christ
.
A
few
words
concerning
the
history
of
the
people
of
Nephi
For
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
fifty
and
five
years
had
passed
away
,
from
the
time
that
Lehi
left
Jerusalem
;
where~
fore
,
Nephi
gave
mc
,
Jacob
,
a
commandment
concerning
the
small
plates
,
upon
which
these
things
are
engraven
.
And
he
gave
me
,
Jacob
,
a
commandment
that
I
should
write
upon
these
plates
,
a
few
of
the
things
which
{
considered
to
be
most
precious
:
that
I
should
not
touch
,
save
it
were
lightly
,
concerning
the
history
of
this
people
which
are
called
the
people
of
Nephi
.
For
he
said
that
the
history
of
his
people
should
be
engraven
upon
his
other
plates
,
and
that
I
should
preserve
these
plates
,
and
hand
them
down
unto
my
sced
,
from
generation
to
generation
.
And
if
there
were
preaching
which
was
sacred
,
or
revelation
which
was
great
,
or
prophesying
,
that
I
should
engraven
the
heads
of
them
upon
these
plates
,
and
touch
upon
them
as
much
as
it
were
possible
,
for
Christ's
sake
,
and
for
the
sake
of
our
people
:
for
because
of
faith
and
great
anxiety
,
it
truly
had
been
made
manifest
unto
us
concer~
ning
our
people
,
what
things
should
happen
unto
them
.
And
we
also
had
many
revelations
,
and
the
spirit
of
much
prophecy
;
wherefore
,
we
knew
of
Christ
and
bis
Kingdom
,
which
should
come
.
Wherefore
,
we
laboured
diligently
among
our
people
,
that
we
might
persuade
them
to
come
unto
Christ
,
and
partake
of
the
goodness
of
God
,
that
they
might
enter
into
his
rest
,
lest
hy
any
means
he
should
swear
in
his
wrath
they
should
not
enter
in
,
as
in
the
provocation
in
the
days
of
tempt~
ation
,
while
the
children
of
israel
were
in
the
wilderness
.—
Wherefore
,
we
would
to
God
that
we
could
persuade
all
men
:
not
10
rebel
against
God
,
to
provoke
him
to
anger
,
but
that
alk
men
would
believe
in
Christ
,
and
view
his
death
,
and
suffer
his
cross
,
and
bear
the
shame
of
the
world
;
wherefore
,
I
,
Ja~
oe
it
upon
me
to
fulfil
the
commandment
of
my
brother
Nephi
.
[File:128]
Now
Nephi
began
to
be
old
,
and
he
saw
that
he
must
S004
tlie
;
wherefore
;
he
anointed
a
man
to
be
a
king
and
a
tule
over
his
people
now
,
according
to
the
reigns
of
the
kings
The
people
having
loved
Nephi
exceedingly
,
he
having
beeny
grcat
protector
for
them
,
having
wielded
the
sword
of
Lab
in
their
defence
,
and
having
lahoured
in
all
his
days
for
thep
weilare
;
wherefore
,
the
people
were
desirous
to
retain
in
yp
,
membrance
his
name
.
And
whoso
should
reign
in
his
sieag
were
called
by
the
people
Second
Nephi
,
Third
Nephi
,
&
,
according
toa
the
reigns
of
the
kings
;
and
thus
they
were
call
.
ed
by
the
people
,
let
them
he
of
whatever
name
they
would
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
died
.
Now
the
people
which
were
not
Lamaniies
,
were
Nephites
;
nevertheless
,
they
wer
ealled
Nephites
,
Jacobites
,
Josephites
,
Zoramites
,
Lamanites
,
Lemuelites
,
and
Ishmaehites
,
But
I
,
Jacob
,
shall
not
hereat
.
ter
distinguish
them
by
these
names
,
but
I
shall
call
them
Le
manites
,
They
that
seek
to
destroy
the
people
of
Nephi
,
ane
they
which
are
friendly
to
Nephi
,
I
shall
call
Nephites
,
or
tle
people
of
Nephi
,
according
to
the
reigns
of
the
kings
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
Nephi
,
unde
the
reign
of
the
second
king
,
began
to
grow
hard
in
ine
hearts
,
and
indulge
themselves
somewhat
in
wicked
practices
,
such
as
like
unto
David
of
Old
desiring
many
wives
and
com
cubines
,
and
also
Solomon
,
son
;
yea
,
and
they
also
begat
fo
search
much
gold
and
silver
,
and
began
to
be
lifted
up
somewhat
in
pride
;
wherefore
,
I
,
Jacob
,
gave
unto
them
thes
words
as
J
taught
them
in
the
temple
,
having
firstly
obtained
mine
errand
from
the
Lord
.
Yor
,
Jacob
,
and
my
brother
Joseph
,
had
becn
consecrated
priests
,
and
teachers
of
this
people
,
by
the
hand
of
Nephi
,
And
we
did
magnify
our
ofhe
unto
the
Lord
,
taking
upon
us
the
responsibility
,
answeriiy
the
sins
of
the
people
upon
our
own
heads
,
if
we
did
no
:
teach
them
the
word
of
God
with
all
diligence
;
wherefore
,
by
laboring
with
our
mights
,
their
blood
might
not
come
upon
olt
garments
;
otherwise
,
their
blood
would
come
Upon
our
gar
ments
,
and
we
would
not
be
found
spotless
at
the
last
day

I
come
up
into

temple
this
day
,
that
I
might
declare
unto
you
the
word
of
God
;
and
ye
yourselves
know

that
1
have
hitherto
been
diligent
in
the
ofice
of
my
calling
;
but
f
this
day
am
weighed
down
with
much
more
desive
and
anxiety
for
the
welfare
of
your
souls
,
than

hitherto

Tor

,
as
yet
,
ye
have
been
obedient
unto
the
word
of
the
Lord
,
which
Ihave
given
unto
you
.
But
behold

hearken
ye
unto
me
,
and
know
that
by
the
help
of
the
All

Creator
of
Heaven

,
1
can
tell
you
congerning
your
thoughts
,
how
that
ye
are
beginning
ta
labor
in
sin
,
which
sin
appeareth
very
abominable
unto
me
,
yea
,
and
abominable
unto
Ged
.
Yea
,
it
grieveth
my
soul
and
canseth
me
to
shrink
with
shame
before
the
presence
of
my
Maker
,
that
1
might
testily
unto
you
concerning
the
wickedness
of
your
hearts
;
and
also
,
it
grieveth
me
that
must
use
so
much
boldness
of
speech
,
concerning
you
,
before
your
wives
and
your
children
,
many
of
whose
feelings
are

and

,
which
thing
is
pleasing
unto
God
;
and
it
supposeth
me
that
they
have
come
up
hither
to
hear
ibe
pleasing
word
of
God
,
yea
,
the
word
which
healeth
the
wounded
soul
.
Wherefore
,
it
bardeneth
iy
soul
,
that
[should
be
constrained
because
of
the
strict
commandment
which
have
received
from
God
,
to
admonish
you
,
according
to
your
crimes
,
to
enlarge
the
wounds
of
those
which
are
already
wounded
,
instead
of
consoling
and
healing
their
wounds
;
and
those
which
have
not
been
wounded
,
instead
of
feasting
upon
the
pleasing
word
of
God
,
have
daggers
placed
to
pierce
their
souls
,
and
wound
their
delicate
minds
.
But
,
notwithstanding
the
greatness
of
the
task
,
Imuat
do
according
to
the
strict
commands
of
God
,
and
tell
you
concerning
your
wickeduess
and
abominations
,
in
the
presence
of
the
pure
in
heart
,
and
the
broken
heart
,
and
under
the
glance
of
the
piercing
eye
of
the
Almighty
God
.
Wherefore
,
1
must
tell
you
the
trath
,
according
to
the
plaine
ness
of
the
word
of
God
.
Tor
behold
,
as
1
inquired
of
the
Lord
,
thus
came
the
word
unto
me
,
saying
,
Jacob
;
get
thou
up
into
the
temple
on
the
morrow
,
and
declare
the
word
which
ishall
give
thee
,
unto
this
people
.
s
And
now
behold
,
my
brethren
,
this
is
the
word
which
I
declare
unto
you
,
that
many
of
you
have
began
to
search
for
gold
,
and
{or
silver
,
and
all
manner
ef
precious
ores
,
in
the
[File:130]
which
this
land
;
which
is
a
land
of
promise
unto
you
,
and
tp
your
seed
,
doth
abound
most
plentifully
.
And
the
hand
of
Providence
hath
smiled
upon
you
most
pleasingly
,
that
yoy
have
obtained
many
riches
;
and
because
that
some
of
you
have
obtained
more
abundantly
than
that
of
your
brethren
,
ye
ar
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
your
hearts
,
and
wear
stiff
Decks
,
and
high
heads
,
because
of
the
costliness
of
your
apparel
,
and
persecute
your
brethren
,
because
that
ye
suppose
that
ye
are
better
then
they
.
And
now
my
brethren
,
do
ye
suppose
that
God
justificth
you
in
this
thing
?
Behold
,
[
say
unto
you
,
Nay
.
But
he
cop
demneth
you
,
and
if
ye
persist
in
these
things
,
his
judgments
must
speedily
come
unto
you
,
©
that
he
would
shew
you
that
he
can
pierce
you
,
and
with
one
glance
of
his
eye
,
he
can
smite
you
to
the
dust
.
O
that
he
would
rid
you
from
this
inj
.
quity
,
and
abomination
.
And
,
O
that
ye
would
listen
unto
the
word
of
his
commands
,
and
let
not
this
pride
of
your
hearts
destroy
your
souls
,
Think
of
your
brethren
,
like
unto
Yourselves
,
and
be
familiar
with
all
,
and
free
with
your
sub
.
stance
,
that
they
may
be
rich
like
unto
you
.
But
before
ve
seek
for
riches
,
seek
ye
for
the
Kingdom
of
God
.
And
aflee
that
ye
have
obtained
a
hope
in
Christ
,
yc
shall
obtain
Tiches
,
ifye
seek
them
;
and
ye
will
seek
them
,
for
the
intent
to
do
good
;
to
clothe
the
naked
,
and
to
feed
the
hungry
,
and
1p
liberate
the
captive
,
and
administer
relief
to
the
sick
,
and
the
afflicted
.
And
now
my
brethren
,
I
have
spoken
unto
you
concerning
pride
;
and
those
of
you
which
have
afflicted
your
neighbor
,
and
persecuted
him
,
because
that
ye
were
proud
in
your
hearts
,
of
the
things
which
God
hath
given
you
,
what
say
ye
of
it
?
Do
ye
not
suppose
that
such
things
are
abominable
unto
him
,
who
created
all
flesh
?
And
the
one
being
is
as
precious
in
his
sight
as
the
other
.
And
all
flesh
is
of
the
dust
;
and
for
the
'
self
same
end
hath
he
created
them
,
that
they
should
keep
his
commandments
,
and
glorify
him
forever
.
And
now
I
make
an
end
of
speaking
unto
you
concerning
this
pride
.
And
were
if
not
that
1
must
speak
unto
you
concerning
a
grosser
crimy
ny
heart
would
rejoice
exceedingly
,
because
of
you
.
But
the
word
of
God
burihens
me
because
of
your
grosser
crimes
,
For
behold
,
thus
saith
ihe
Lord
:
This
People

;
they
understand
not
the
Scriptures
:
for
they
seek
to
excuse
themsclyes
in
committing
whoredoms
,
beeause
of
the
things
which
were
written
concerning
David
,
and
Sola
[File:131]
mop
his
fon

Bebold
,
David
and
Solomon
truly
had
many
wives
and
concubines
,
which
thing
was'
abominable
betore
me
,
saith
the
Lord
.
Wherefore
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
:
[have
led
this
people
forth
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
by
the
ower
of
mine
arm
,
that
1
might
raise
up
unto
mea
righteous
branch
,
from
the
fruit
of
the
loins
of
Joseph
.
Wherefore
,
J
,
the
Lord
God
,
will
uot
sufier
that
this
people
shall
do
hke
nato
them
of
old
.
Wherefore
,
my
brethren
,
hear
me
,
and
hearken
to
the
word
of
the
Lord
:
for
there
shall
not
any
man
among
you
bave
save
jt
be
one
wife
;
and
coucubines
he
shall
have
none
:
For
I
,
the
Lord
God
,
delighteth
in
the
chastity
of
women
.
And
whoredoms
is
an
abomination
before
me
:
thus
saith
the
Lord
of
Hosts
.
Wherefore
,
this
peeple
shall
keep
my
commandments
,
saith
the
Lord
of
Hosts
,
or
cursed
be
the
Jand
for
their
sakes
.
For
if]
will
,
saith
the
Lord
of
Hosts
,
raise
up
seed
unto
me
,
I
will
command
my
people
:
otherwise
,
they
shall
hearken
unto
these
things
.
For
behold
,
I
,
the
Lord
,
have
seen
the
sorrow
,
and
heard
the
mourning
of
the
daughters
of
my
people
,
in
the
land
of
Jerusalem
;
yea
,
and
in
all
the
lands
of
my
people
,
because
of
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
their
husbands
.
And
I
will
uot
suffer
,
saith
the
Lord
of
Hosts
,
that
the
cries
of
the
fair
daughters
of
this
people
,
which
I
have
led
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
shell
come
up
unto
me
,
against
the
men
of
my
people
,
saith
the
Lord
of
Hosts
;
for
they
shall
not
lead
away
captive
,
the
daughters
of
my
people
,
because
of
their
tenderness
,
save
I
shall
visit
them
with
a
sore
curse
,
even
unto
destruction
;
for
they
shall
not
commit
whoredoms
,
like
unto
they
of
old
,
saith
the
Lord
of
Tlosts
.
And
now
behold
,
my
brethren
,
ye
know
that
these
commandments
were
given
to
our
father
Lehi
;
wherefore
,
ye
have
known
them
before
;
and
ye
have
come
unto
great
condemnation
;
fox
,
ye
have
done
these
things
,
which
ye
ought
not
to
have
done
.
Behold
,
ye
have
done
greater
iniquities
than
the
J
.
amanites
,
ourbrethren
.
Ye
have
broken
the
hearts
of
your
tender
wives
,
and
lost
the
confidence
of
your
children
,
because
of
your
bac
,
examples
before
them
;
and
the
sobbings
of
their
hearts
ascendeth
upto
God
against
you
.

O

O

I
fear

that
unless

sins
,
that
their
skins
will
be
whiter
than
yours
,
when
ye

of
God
.
Wherefor
,
acommandinent]
give
unto
you
,
which
is
the
word
of
Col
,
that
ye
revile
no
more
ayainst
them
,
because
of
the
darknes
of
their
skins
;
neither
shall
ye
revile
against
them
because
their
filthiness
;
but
ye
shall
remember
your
own
{filthiness
,
,
and
remember
that
their
filthiness
came'
because
of
their
&
thers
.
Wherefore
,
ye
shall
remember
your
children
,
how
that
ye
have
grieved
their
hearts
,
because
of
the
example
that
ye
have
set
before
them
;
and
also
,
remember
.
that
yo
may
,
because
of
your
filthiness
,
bring
your
children
unto
destruction
,
tnd
their
sins

heaped
upon

0
my
brethren
,
hearken
unto
my
word
;
arouse
the
factl
ses
of
your
soul
;
shake
yourselves
,
that
ye
may
awake
from
[File:133]
the
slumber
of
death
;
and
loose
yourselves
from
the
pains
of
hell
,
that
ye
maynot
become
Angels
to
the
Devil
,
to
be
cast
into
that
lake
of
dire
and
brimstone
,
which
is
the
second
death
.
And
now
,
Jacob
,
spake
many
more
things
unto
the
people
of
Nephi
,
warning
them
against
fornication
,
and
lasciviousness
,
.
and
every
kind
of
sin
,
telling
them
the
awful
consequences
of
tem
;
and
a
hundredth
part
of
the
proceedings
of
this
people
,
which
now
began
to
be
numerous
,
cannot
be
written
upon
these
plates
;
but
many
of
their
proceedings
are
writen
upon
the
larger
plates
,
and
their
wars
,
and
their
contentions
,
and
the
reigns
of
their
kings
.
These
plates
are
called
the
plates
of
:
Jacob
;
and
they
were
made
by
the
hand
of
Nephi
.

And

CHAPTER
UL
Now
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
,
that
I
,
Jacob
,
having
ministered
mach
unto
my
people
,
in
word
,
(
and
I
cannot
write
but
a
litle
of
my
words
,
because
of
the
difficulty
of
engraving
our
words
upon
plates
,)
and
we
know
that
the
things
which
we
write
upon
plates
,
must
remain
;
but
whatsoever
things
we
write
upon
any
thing
save
it
be
upon
plates
,
must
perish
and
yanish
away
;
but
we
can
write
a
few
words
upon
plates
,
which
will
give
our
children
,
and
also
our
beloved
brethen
,
a
small
degree
of
knowledse
concerning
us
,
or
concerning
their
fathers
.
Now
in
this
thing
we
do
rejuice
;
and
we
labor
diligently
to
engraven
these
words
upon
plates
,
hoping
that
our
beloved
brethren
,
and
our
children
,
will
receive
them
with
thankful
hearts
,
and
lonk
upon
them
,
that
they
may
learn
with
joy
,
and
nol
with
sorrow
,
neither
with
contempt
,
concerning
their
first
parents
:
for
,
for
this
intent
have
we
written
these
things
,
that
they
may
know
that
we
knew
of
Christ
,
and
we
had
a
hope
of
his
glory
,
many
hundred
years
before
his
coming
;
and
not
only
we
,
ourselves
,
had
a
hope
of
his
glory
,
but
also
all
the
Holy
Prophets
which
were
before
us
.
;
Behold
,
they
believed
in
Christ
,
and
worshiped
the
Fatherin
his
name
;
and
also
,
we
worship
the
Father
inhis
name
.
And
for
this
intent
,
we
keep
the
law
of
Moses
,
il
pointing
our
souls
to
him
;
and
for
this
cause
,
it
is
sanctified
unto
us
for
righteousness
,
even
as
it
was
accounted
onto
Abraham
:
in
the
wilderness
,
to
be
obedient
unto
.
the
commands
of
God
,
in
offering
,
3
[File:134]
up
his
son
Tsaac
,
which
was
a
similitude
of
God
and
his
9
begotten
Son
.
Wherefore
,
we
search
the
Prophets
;
and
yy
have
many
revelations
,
and
the
spirit
of
prophecy
;
and
ha
.
ing
all
these
witnesses
,
we
obtain
a
hope
,
and
oust
dee
.
meth
unshaken
,
insomuch
that
we
truly
can
command
in
tip
name
of
Jesus
,
and
the
very
trees
obey
us
,
or
the
mountaiy
or
the
waves
of
the
sea
;
nevertheless
,
the
Lord
God
shewe
,
us
our
weakness
,
that
we
may
know
that
it
is
by
his
grag
.
and
his
great
condescentions
unto
the
children
of
men
,
the
we
have
power
to
do
these
things
.
Behold
,
great
and
marvellous
are
the
works
of
the
Lord
.
Tow
unsearchable
are
the
depths
of
the
mysteries
of
Hip
and
it
is
impossible
that
man
should
find
out
all
his
Woysm
And
no
man
knoweth
of
his
ways
,
save
it
be
revealed
unte
hin
:
wherefore
,
brethren
,
despise
not
the
revelations
of
God
,
Ky
behold
,
by
the
power
of
his
word
,
man
came
upon
the
faced
the
earth
;
which
earth
was
created
by
the
power
of
his
won
,
Wherefore
,
if
God
,
being
able
to
speuk
,
and
the
world
was
,
and
to
speak
,
and
man
was
created
,
O
then
,
why
not
able
&
command
the
earth
,
or
the
workmanship
of
his
hands
upy
the
face
of
it
,
according
to
his
will
and
pleasure
.
Whierefoy
,
brethren
,
seek
not
to
counsel
the
Lord
,
but
to
take
couns
!
from
his
hand
.
For
behold
,
ye
yourselves
know
,
that
ke
counseleth
in
wisdom
,
and
in
justice
,
and
in
great
mercy
,
ove
all
his
works
;
wherefore
,
beloved
brethren
,
be
reconciled
us
to
him
,
through
the
atonement
of
Christ
,
his
only
begotten
8m
that
ye
may
obtain
a
resurrection
,
according
to
the
powerd
the
resurrection
which
is
in
Christ
,
and
be
presented
as
te
first
fruits
of
Christ
,
unto
God
,
having
faith
,
and
obtainela
good
hope
of
glory
in
him
,
before
he
manifesteth
himselfa
the
flesh
.
And
now
,
beloved
,
marvel
not
that
T
tell
you
these
things
:
for
why
not
speak
of
the
atonement
of
Christ
,
and
attain
to
!
perfect
knowledge
of
him
,
as
to
attain
to
the
knowledge
di
,
resurrection
and
the
world
to
come
?
Behold
,
my
brethrentt
that
prophesieth
,
let
him
prophesy
to
the
understanding
d
men
;
for
the
spirit
speaketh
the
truth
,
and
lieth
not
.
Wier
fore
,
itspeaketh
of
things
as
they
really
are
,
and
of
things
#
they
really
will
be
;
wherefore
,
these
things
are
manifested
uto
us
plainly
,
for
the
salvation
of
our
souls
.
But
behold
,
st
are
not
witnesses
alone
in
these
things
;
for
God
also
spit
them
unto
Prophets
of
old
.
But
behold
,
the
Jews
were
a
stiffnecked
people
;
and
the
[File:135]
deapised
the
words
of
plainness
,
and
killed
the
Prophets
,
and
sought
for
things
that
they
could
not
understand
.
Wherefore
,
because
of
their
blindness
,
which
blindness
came
by
looking
beyond
the
mark
,
they
must
needs
fall
:
for
God
hath
taken
away
his
plainness
from
them
,
and
delivered
unto
them
many
things
which
they
cannot
understand
;
because
they
desired
it
.
And
because
they
desired
it
,
God
hath
donc
it
,
that
they
may
stumble
.
And
now
I
,
Jacob
,
am
led
on
by
the
spirit
unto
prophesying
:
for
I
perceive
by
the
workings
of
the
spirit
which
is
in
me
,
that
by
the
stumbling
of
the
Jews
,
they
will
reject
the
stone
upen
which
they
might
build
,
and
have
safe
foundation
.
But
behold
,
according
to
the
Scriptures
,
this
stone
shall
become
the
great
,
and
the
last
,
and
the
only
sure
foundation
,
upon
which
the
Jews
can
build
.
And
now
,
my
beloved
,
how
is
it
possible
that
these
,
after
having
rejected
the
sure
foundation
,
can
ever
build
upon
it
,
that
it
may
become
the
head
of
their
eorner
?
Behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
will
unfold
this
mystery
,
unto
you
;
if]
do
not
,
by
any
means
,
get
shaken
from
my
firmness
in
the
spirit
,
and
stumble
because
of
my
over
anxiety
for
you
.
Behold
,
my
brethren
,
do
ye
not
remember
to
have
read
the
words
of
the
Prophet
Zenos
,
which
spake
unto
the
House
of
Isracl
,
saying
:
Hearken
O
ye
House
of
Israel
,
and
hear
the
words
of
me
,
a
Prophet
of
the
Lord
:
for
behold
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
,
I
will
liken
thee
,
O
House
of
Israel
,
like
unto
a
tame
olive
tree
,
which
a
man
took
and
nourished
in
his
vineyard
;
and
it
grew
,
and
waxed
old
,
and
began
to
decay
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
master
of
the
vineyard
went
forth
,
and
he
saw
that
his
olive
tree
began
to
decay
;
and
he
sayeth
,
I
will
prance
it
,
and
dig
about
it
,
and
nourish
it
,
that
perhaps
it
may
shoot
forth
young
and
tender
branches
,
and
it
perish
not
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
pruned
it
,
and
digged
about
it
,
and
nourished
it
,
according
to
his
word
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
many
days
,
it
began
to
put
forth
somewhat
a
ithe
,
young
and
tender
branches
;
but
behold
,
the
main
top
thereof
began
to
perish
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
master
of
the
vineyard
saw
it
,
and
he
sayeth
unto
his
servant
,
It
grieveth
me
that
I
should
lose
this
tree
;
wherefore
,
go
and
pluck
the
branches
from
a
wild
olive
tree
,
and
bring
them
hither
unto
me
;
and
we
will
pluck
off
those
main
branches
which
are
begining
to
wither
away
,
and
we
will
cast
them
into
the
fire
,
that
they
may
be
burned
.
And
behold
,
saith
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
,
¥
[File:136]
take
away
many
of
these
young
and
tender
branches
,
and}
will
graft
them
whithersoever

;
and
it
mattercth
not
thes
if
it
so
be
,
that
the
root
of
this
tree
will
perish
,
I
may
presen
the
fruit
thereof
unto
myself
;
wherefore
,
I
will
iake
thee
young
and
tender
branches
,
and
I
will
graft
them
whither

Take

the
branches

and
these
which

hay
plucked
off

I
will
cast
into
the
fire
,
and
burn
them
,
that

of

And
te
Lord
of
the

caused
that

for

And
it
came
to

And

And

And

Let

that

that
part

that

unto

What
could
I
have
done
more
for
my

Behold
,
I
knew
that
all
the
fruit
of
the
vineyard
,
save
it
were
these
,
had
become
corrupted
.
And
now
,
these
which
haye
once
brought
forth

fruit

have
also
become
corrupted

And
now
,
all
the
trees
of
my
vineyard
are
good
for
nothing
,
save
it
be
to
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into

And
behold
,
this
last
,
whose
branch
hath
withered
away
,
I
did
plant
in
a
good
spot
of
ground
;
yea
,
even
that
which
was
choice
unto
me
,
above
all
other
parts
of

of

And
thou
beheldest
that
I
also
cut
down
that
which
cumbered
this
spot
of
ground
,
that
T
might
plant
this
tree
in
the
stead
thereof
.
And
thou
bebeldest
that
a
part
thereof
,
brought
forth
good
fruit
;

a

thereof

brought
forth
wild
fruit

And
because
that
I
plucked
not
the
branches
thereof

cast
them
into
the
fire
,
behold
,
they
have
overcome
the
good
branch
,
that
it
hath
withered
away

And
now
behold
,
notwithstanding
all
the
care
which
we
have
taken
of

,
the
trees
thereof
hath
become
corrupted
,
that

they

that
they
may
grow
;
end
as
they
begin
to
grow
,
ye
shall
clear
away
the
branches
which
bring
forth
bitter
fruit
,
according
to
the
strength
of
the
good
and
the
size
thereof
;
and
ye
shall
not
clear
away
the
bad
thereof
,
all
at
once
,
lest
the
roots
thereof
should
be
too
strong
for
the
graft
,
and
the
graft
thereof
shall
perish
,
and
1
lase
the
trees
of
my
vineyard
.
For
it
grieveih
me
that
[
should
lise
the
trees
of
my
vineyard
;
wherefore
,
ye
shall
clear
away
the
bad
,
according
as
the
good
shall
grow
,
that
the
reot
and
the
top
may
be
equal
in
strength
,
until
the
good
shall
overcome
the
bad
,
and
the
bad
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
,
that
they
cumber
not
the
ground
of
my
vineyard
;
and
thus
will
£
sweep
away
the
bad
out
of
my
vineyard
.
And
the
branches
,
of
the
natural
tree
,
will
I
graft
in
again
,
into
the
natural

;
[File:142]
and
the
branches
of
the
natural

,
will
I
graft
into

of
the
tree
;
and
thus
will
I
bring
them
togethor
again
,
that
they
shall
bring
forth
the
natural
fruit
:
and
they
shall
be
one
.
And
the
bad
shall
be
cast
away
;
yea
,
even
oy

of
all
the
land
of
my
vineyard
:
for
behold
,
only
this
once
yj]
I
prune
my
vineyard
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
thatthe
Lord
of
the
vineyard
sent
his
Servant
;
and
the
servant
went
and
did
as
the
Lord
had
com
manded
him
,
and
brought
other
servants
;
and
they
were
fey
,
And
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
saith
unto
them
,
Go
to
,
and
Ip
bor
in
the
vineyard
,
with
your
mights
.
For
behold
,
thisis
the
last
time
that
I
shall
nourish
my
vineyard
;
for
the
end
js
nigh
at
hand
,
ard
the
season
speedily
cometh
;
and
if
ye
labor
with
your
mights
with
me
,
ye
shall
have
joy
in
the
fruit
which
4
shall
lay
up
unto
myself
,
against
the
time
which
will
soo
come
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
servants
did
go
to
it
,
and
h
.
bor
with
their
mights
;
and
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
labored
also
with
them
:
and
they
did
obey
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
,
in
all
things
,
And
there
began
to
be
the
natural
fruit
again
in
the
vineyard
;
and
the
natural
branches
began
to
grow
and
thrive
exceedingly
;
and
the
wild
branches
began
to
be
plucked
off
,
and
to
be
east
away
;
and
they
dd
keep
the
root
and
the
top
thercof
,
equal
,
according
to
the
strength
thereof
,
And
thus
they
labored
,
with
all
.
diligence
,
according
to
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
of
the
vineyarl
,
even
antl
the
bad
had
been
cast
away
out
of
the
vineyard
,
ani
the
Lord
had
preserved
unto
himself
,
that
ihe
trees
had
become
again
the
natural
fruit
;
and
they
became
like
unto
one
body
;
and
the
fruit
were
equal
;
and
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
had
preserved
unto
himself
the
natural
fruit
,
which
was
most
pre
:
cious
unto
him
from
the
beginning
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
saw
that
his
fruit
was
good
,
and
that
his
vineyard
was
no
mor
corrupt
,
he
calleth
up
his
servants
and
sayeth
unto
them
,
Be

for
this
last
time

we
nourished
my
vineyard
;
and
thou
beholdest
that
[
have
done
according
to
my
will
;
and
J
have
preserved
the
natural
fruit
,
that
it
is
good
,
even
ke
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
;
and
blessed
art
thou
.
For
because
that
ye
have
been
diligent
in
laboring
with
me
in
my
vineyard
,
and
have
kept
my
commandments
,
and
hath
brought
unto
me
agam
the
netural
fruit
,
that
my
vineyard
is
no
more
corrupted
,
and
the
bad
is
cast
away
,
behold
,
ye
shail
have
joy
with
me
,
[File:143]
hecause
of
the
frait
of

,
For
behold
,
for
a
long
time
will
[
lay
up
of
the
fruit
of
my
vineyard
unto
mime
own
self
,
against
the
season
,
which
speedily
cometh
;
and
for
the
last
time

nourished
my

,
and
pruned
it
,
and
dug
about
it
,
and
dunged

wherefore
{
will
Jay
up

And

CHAPTER
IV
.
Any
now
,
behold
,
my
brethren
,
as
I
said
tnio
you
that
I
would
prophesy
,
behold
,
this
is
my
prophesy
:
That
the
things
which
this
prophet
Zenos
spake
,
concerning
the
House
of
Isracl
,
in
the
which
he
likened
them
unto
a
tame
olive
tree
,
must
surely
come
to
pass
.
And
in
the
day
that
he
shall
set
his
hand
again
the
second
time
to
recover
his
people
,
is
the
day
,
yea
,
even
the
last
time
,
that
the
servants
of
the
Lord
shall
go
forth
in
his
power
,
to
nourish
and
prune
his
vineyard
;
and
after
that
,
the
end
soon
cometh
.
And
how
blessed
are
they
who
have
Jabored
diligently
in
his
vineyard
;
and
how
cursed
are
they
which
shall
be
cast
out
into
their
own
place
!
And
the
world
shall
be
burned
with
fire
.
And
how
merciful
is
our
God
unto
us
:
for
he
remembereth
the
House
of
Israel
,
both
roots
and
branches
;
and
he
stretches
forth
his
hands
unto
them
,
all
the
day
long
:
and
they
are
a
~tiffnecked
,
and
a
gainsaying
people
;
but
as
many
as
will
not
harden
their
hearts
,
shall
be
saved
in
the
Kingdom
of
God
.
Wherefore
,
my
beloyed
brethren
,
I
beseech
of
you
in
words
of
soberness
,
that
ye
would
repent
,
and
come
with
full
purpose
of
heart
,
and
cleave
~
unto
God
as
he
cleaveth
unto
you
.
And
while
his
arm
of
mercy
is
extended
towards
you
in
the
light
of
the
day
,
harden
not
your
hearts
.
Yea
,
to-day
if
ye
will
hear
his
voice
,
harden
not
your
hearts
:
for
why
will
ye
die
?
For
behold
,
after
that
.
ye
have
been
nourished
by
the
good
word
of
God
all
the
day
long
,
will
ye
bring
forth
evil
fruit
,
that
ye
must
be
hewn
down
_
and
cast
into
the
fire
?
Behold
,
will
ye
reject
these
words
[File:144]
Will
ye
reject
the
words
of
the
Prophets
?
and
will
ye
Peject
all
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
concerning
Christ
,
af
ter
that
so
many
have
spoken
concerning
him
?
and
deny
the
good
word
of
Christ
,
and
the
power
of
God
,
and
the
gift
the
Holy
Ghost
,
and
quench
the
Holy
Spirit
?
and
make
;
mock
:
of
the
great
plan
of
redemption
,
which
hath
been
laid
for
you
?
Know
ye
not
that
if
ye
will
do
these
things
,
thy
the
power
of
the
redemption
and
the
resurrection
which
jag
Christ
,
will
bring
you
to
stand
with
shame
and
awful
guilt
by
fore
the
bar
of
God
,
and
according
to
the
power
of
justice
!
for
justice
cannot
be
denied
.
That
ye
must
go
away
into
the
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
,
whose
Hames
are
unquenchable
,
and
whose
smoke
ascendeth
up
forever
and
ever
?
which
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
,
is
endless
torment
.
©
then
,
may
beloved
breihren
,
repent
ye
,
and
enter
in
at
the
straight
gate
,
and
em

tinue
in
the
way
which
is
narrow
,
until
ye
shall
obtain
etermd

.
O
be
wise
:
what
can
I
say
more
?
Finally
,
I
bid
you
farewell
,
until
I
shall
meet
you
before

of

CHAPTER
V
.
Anp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
some
years
had
mali
;
wiway
,
there
came
a
man
among
the
people
of
Nephi
,
whow
name
was
Sherem
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
began
io
preach
among
the
people
,
and
to
declare
unto
them
that
ther
should
be
no
Christ
.
And
he
preached
many
things
whith
were
flattering
unto
the
people
;
and
this
he
done
,
that
he
wilt
overthrow
ihe
doctrine
of
Christ
.
And
he
labored
diligent
that
he
might
lead
away
the
hearts
of
the
people
,
insomuch
that
he
did
lead
away
many
hearis
;
and
he
knowing
that]
Jacob
,
had
faith
in
Christ
which
should
come
,
wherefore
,
lt
sought
much
opportunity
that
he
might
come
unto
me
.
Al
he
was
learned
,
that
he
had
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
ler
guege
of
the
people
;
wherefore
,
he
could
use
much
flatter
,
and
much
power
of
speech
,
according
to
the
power
of
it
Devil
.
And
he
had
hope
to
shake
me
from
the
faith
,
notwill
:
steading
the
many
reveiations
,
and
the
many
things
which
!
had
seen
concerning
these
things
:
for
truly
had
seen
Angels
and
they
lad
ministered
unto
me
.
And
also
,
Thad
heaed
tlt
[File:145]
voice
of
the
Lord
speaking
unto
me
in
very
word
,
from
time
to
ume
;
waerefore
,
{
could
not
be
shaken
.
And
it
came
10
pass
that
he
came
unto
me
;
and
on
this
wise
did
he
speak
unto
me
,
saying
:
Brother
Jacob
,
1
have
soucht
much
opportunity
that
I
might
speak
unto
you
:
for
I
have
ecard
and
also
know
,
that
thou
goest
about
much
,
preaching
that
which
ye
call
the
Gospel
,
or
the
doctrine
of
Christ
5
and
ye
have
led
away
nich
of
this
people
,
that
they
pervert
the
rigat
way
af
God
,
and
keep
not
the
luv
of
Moses
,
which
is
the
rigut
way
;
and
convert
{he
law
of
Moses
into
the
wor
-,
ship
of
a
being
,
which
ye
say
vhall
come
many
hundred
years
fence
.
And
now
behold
,
1
,
Sherem
,
declare
unto
you
,
that
thisis
blasphemy
;
for
no
man
knoweth
of
such
things
;
for
he
cannot
of
things
to
come
.
And
after
this
manner
did
Sherem
contend
agaim
-
t
me
.
But
behold
,
the
Lord
God
pourein
his
spirit
into
my
soul
,
imsomuch
that
¥
did
confound
bim
in
all
bis
words
.
And
}
sayeth
unto
him
,
Deniest
thou
the
Christ
which
should
come
?
And
he
sayeth
,
If
there
should
be
a
Christ
,
f
would
aot
deny
him
;
but
know
that
there
is
no
Christ
,
neither
hath
bern
,
nor
never
will
be
.
And
J
sayeth
unto
him
,
Beliovest
thou
the
Scriptures
?
And
he
sayeth
,
Yea
.
And
Tsaycth
unio
him
,
Then
ye
do
not
understand
them
;
for
they
truly
testify
of
Christ
.
Behold
,
say
unto
.
you
,
That
none
of
the
prophets
have
written
,
nor
prophesied
,
save
they
have
spoken
concerning
this
Christ
.
Aud
this
is
not
all
:
it
hath
heen
made
manifest
unto
me
,
for
Lhave
heard
and
seen
;
and
it
also
hath
been
made
manifest
unto
me
hy
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;
wherefore
,
1
know
if
there
should
be
no
atonement
made
,
all
mankind
must
be
lost
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
sayeth
unto
me
,
Shew
me
o
sign
by
this
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
in
the
which
ye
know
so
much
,
And
J
said
unto
him
,
What
am
J
,
that
[should
tempt
God
to
shew
unto
thee
a
sign
,
in
the
thmg
which
thou
knowest
to
be
truc
?
Yet
thou
wilt
deny
it
,
because
thou
art
ofthe
Devil
.
Nevertheless
,
not
my
will
be
done
;
but
if
God
shall
smite
thee
,
Jet
that
be
a
sign
unto
thee
that
he
hath
power
,
both
in
Heaven
and
in
Earth
;
and
also
,
that
Christ
shall
come
.
And
thy
will
,
O
Lord
,
be
donc
,
and
not
mine
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
J
,
Jacob
,
had
spoken
these
words
,
the
power
of
the
Lord
came
upon
him
,
insomuch
that
he
fell
tothe
earth
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
nourished
for
the
space
of
many
days
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
sayeth
unto
the
people
,
Gather
together
on
the
morrow
,
for
[File:146]
1
shall
die
;
wherefore
,
I
desire
to
speak
unto
the
people
bg
,
fore
that
1
shal}
dic
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
,
that
the
multitu
,
were
gathered
together
;
and
he
spake
plainly
unto
them
,
an
?
denied
the
things
which
he
had
taught
them
;
and
confessed
the
Christ
,
and
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
and
the
ming
tering
of
Angels
,
And
he
spake
plainly
unto
them
,
that
bp
had
heen
deceived
by
the
power
of
the
Devil
.
And
he
spely
of
hell
,
and
of
eternity
,
and
of
cternal
punishment
.
And
iy
sayeth
,
I
fear
lest
I
have
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
,
fy
T
have
lied
unto
God
:
for
I
denied
the
Christ
,
and
said
tha
I
believed
the
Seriptures
;
and
they
truly
testify
of
him
.
An
?
because
that
I
have
thus
lied
unto
God
,
I
greatly
fear
lest
my
vase
shall
be
awful
;
but
1
confess
unto
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
said
these
words
,
lk
could
say
no
more
;
and
he
gave
up
the
ghost
.
And
whentl
multitude
had
witnessed
that
he
spake
these
things
as
he
wx
about
to
give
up
the
ghost
,
they
were
astonished
exceedingly
;
insomuch
,
that
the
power
of
God
came
down
upon
them
,
aid
they
were
overcome
,
that
they
fell
to
the
earth
.
Now
,
ili
thing
was
pleasing
unto
me
,
Jacob
;
for
I
had
requested
itd
my
Father
which
was
im
Heaven
:
for
he
had
heard
my
ery
,
ad
answered
my
prayer
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
peace
,
and
the
love
of
God
,
wa
restored
again
among
the
people
;
and
they
searched
the
Semp
tures
,
and
hearkened
no
more
tothe
words
of
this
wicked
ma
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
many
means
were
devised
,
to
reclain
and
restore
the
Lamanites
,
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
;
ht
it
all
were
vain
:
for

wherefore
,
the
people
of

did
fortify
against
them
with
their
armies
,
and
with
all
their
might
,
trusting
in
the
Goi
and

became

we
did
mourn
out
our

And
I
,
Jacob
,
saw
that

must
soon
go
down
to

I
said
unto

Take
these

1
told
him
the
things
which
my

had
commanded

;

he
promised
obedience
unto
the
commands
.
And
I
make
an

of
my

upon

THE
BOOK
OF
ENOS
.
CHAPTER
I
.
Benoip
,
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Enos
,
knowing
my
fathew
,
that
he
was
a
just
man
:
for
he
taught
me
in
bis
language
,
and
also
in
the
nurture
and
admonition
of
the
Lord
,
And
blessed
:
be
the
name
of
my
God
for
it
.
And
will
tell
you
of
the'
.
wrestle
which
I
had
before
God
,
before
that
I
received
a
remission
of
my
sins
:
behold
,
I
went
to
hunt
beasts
in
the
forest
;
and
the
words
which
I
had
often
heard
my
father
speak
,
concerning
eternal
life
,
and
the
joy
of
the
saints
,
and
the
words
of
my
father
,
sunk
deep
into
my
heart
.
And
my
soul
hungered
;
and
I
kneeled
down
before
my
Maker
,
and
J
cried
unto
him
in
mighty
prayer
and
supplication
,
for
mine
own
soul
;
and
all
the
day
long
did
I
cry
unto
him
;
yea
,
and
when
the
aight
eame
,
I
did
stillraise
my
voice
high
.
that
it
reached
the
heavens
.
And
there
came
a
voice
unto
me
saying
,
Enos
,
thy
sins
are
forgiven
thee
,
and
thou
shalt
be
blessed
.
And
1
,
Enos
,
knew
that
God
could
not
ie
;
wherefore
,
my
guilt
was
swept
away
.
And
I
sayeth
,
Lord
,
how
isit
done
?
And
he
sayeth
unto
me
,
Because
of
thy
faith
in
Christ
,
whom
thou
hast
not
heard
nor
seen
,
And
many
years
passeth
away
,
before
that
he
shall
manifest
himself
in
the
flesh
;
wherefore
,
go
to
it
,
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
whole
,
Now
,
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
had
heard
these
words
,
I
began
to
feel
a
desire
for
the
welfare
of
my
brethren
,
the
Ne
.
phites
;
wherefore
,
I
did
pour
out
my
whole
soul
unto
God
for
them
.
And
while
I
was
thus
straggling
in'the
spirit
,
behold
,
the
yoice
of
the
Lord
came
into
my
tind
again
,
saying
,
I
will
Visit
thy
brethren
,
according
to
their
diligence
in
keeping
my
[File:148]
commandments
.
I
have
given
unto
them
this
land
;
and
itis
a
holy
land
;
and
I
curse
it
not
,
save
it
be
for
the
cause
of
inp
quity
;
wherefore
,
I
will
visit
thy
brethren
,
according
as
J
hays
said
;
and
their
transgressions
will
bring
down
swith
sorrey
upon
their
owa
heads
.
And
after
that
1
,
Enos
,
had
heard
thee
words
,
my
faith
began
to
be
anshaken
in
the
Lord
;
and}
prayed
uato
him
with
many
long
stragglings
for
my
brethren
,
the
Lumanites
.
5}
And
it
came
to
pass
,
that
after
I
bad
prayed
,
and
labored
with
all
dilgence
,
the
Lord
said
unto
me
,
will
grant
unto
thee
according
to
thy
desires
,
becauxe
of
thy
faith
.
And
now
he
hold
,
this
was
the
desire
which
T
desired
of
him
:
That
iff
should
so
be
,
that
my
people
,
the
Nephites
,
should
fall
into
transgression
,
and
by
any
means
be
destroyed
,
and
the
La
manites
should
not
be
destroyed
,
that
the
Lord
God
would
preserve
a
record
of
my
people
,
the
Nephites
;
even
if
it
be
,
by
the
power
of
his
holy
arm
,
that
it
might
be
bronght
forth
,
at
some
future
day
,
unto
the
Lamaunites
,
that
perhaps
_
they
might
be
brought
unio
salvationy
for
at
the
present
,
our
sirug
les
were
vain
,
in
restoring
them
to
the
true
futh
.
And
they
swore
in
their
wrath
,
that
if
il
were
pussible
,
they
would
desiroy
our
records
and
us
;
and
,
also
,
all
the
traditions
of
ou
fathers
.
Wherefore
,
I
knowing
that
the
Lord
God
was
able
to
pre
serve
our
records
,
J
cried
unto
him
continually
;
for
he
bad
said
unto
me
,
Whatsoever
thing
ye
shall
ask
in
fuith
,
believing
that
ye
shail
recieve
in
the
naine
of
Christ
,
ye
shall
receiveit
And
[
had
faith
,
and
I
did
cry
unto
God
,
that
he
would
pre
serve
the
records
;
and
he
covenated
with
me
that
he
would
bring
them
forth
unto
the
Lamanites
,
in
his
own
due
time
—
And
I
,
Enos
,
knew
it
would
be
according
to
the
covenant
whiel
he
had
made
;
wherefore
,
my
soul
did
And
the
Lond
said
unto
me
,
Thy
fathers
have
also
required
of
me
this
thing}
and
it
shall
be
done
unto
them
according
to
their
faith
,
for
ther
faith
was
like
unto
thine
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
,
that
I
,
Enos
,
went
obout
among
the
people
of
Nephi
,
prophesying
of
things
to
come
,
and
tes
tifying
of
the
things
which
I
had
heard
and
seen
.
And
Thare
re
record
that
the
people
of
Nephi
did
seek
diligently
to
restore
tle
Lamanites
unto
the
true
faith
in
God
,
Bat
ourlabors
were
vain
;
their
hatred
was
fixed
,
and
they
were
led
by
their
evil
nature
,
that
they
became
wild
,
and
{sroetous
,
and
a
blood
-
thirsty
peo
ple
:
full
of
idolatry
,
and
filthiness
;
feading
upon
beasts
of
preys
[File:149]
dwelling
in
tents
,
and
wandering
about
in
the
wilderness
,
with
a
short
skin
girded
about
their
foins
,
and
their
heads
shaven
;
and
their
skill
was
in
the
bow
,
and
the
cimeter
,
and
the
axe
.—
And
may
of
them
did
eat
nothing
save
it
was
raw
meat
;
and
they
were
continually
seeking
to
destroy
us
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
Nephi
did
till
the
Jand
,
and
raise
all
manner
of
grain
,
and
of
fruit
,
and
flocks
of
herds
,
and
ilocks
of
all
manner
of
cattle
,
of
every
kind
,
and
goats
,
and
wild
goats
,
and
also
much
horses
.
And
thereywere
exceeding
many
prophets
among
us
.
And
the
people
were
@
sliftnecked
people
,
hard
to
understand
.
And
there
was
nothing
save
it
was
exceeding
harshness
,
preaching
,
and
proplhiesying
of
wars
,
and
contentions
,
and
destractions
,
and
continually
reminding
them
of
death
,
and
the
duration
of
eternity
,
and
the
judgments
and
the
power
of
God
;
and
all
these
thingsstirring
them
up
continually
,
to
keep
them
in
the
fear
of
the
Lord
,
Tsay
there
was
nothing
short
of
these
things
,
and
exceeding
great
plainness
of
speech
,
would
keep
them
from
going
down
speedily
to
destruction
.
And
after
this
manner
do
1
write
concerning
them
.
And
I
saw
wars
between
the
Nephites
and
Lamanites
,
in
the
course
of
my
days
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
began
to
be
old
,
and
an
hundred
and
seventy
and
nine
years
had
passed
away
from
the
time
that
our
father
Lehi
left
Jerusalem
.
And
as
I
saw
that
I
must
soon
o
down
to
my
grave
,
having
been
wrought
upon
by
the
power
of
God
,
that
1
must
preach
and
prophesy
unto
this
people
,
and
declare
the
word
according
to
the
truth
,
which
is
in
Christ
.
And
J
have
declared
it
,
in
all
my
days
,
and
have
rejoiced
in
it
,
above
that
of
the
world
.
And
1
soon
go
io
the
place
of
my
rest
,
which
is
with
my

;
for
I
know
that
in

and
I
rejoice
in
the
day
when
my

shall
pat

then

words

according

that

And
as

as

benefit
of
our

wherefore
,
it
must
needs
be
that
Twrite
a
little
;
but]
shal]
not
write
the
things
of
my
prophesying
,
nor
of
my
reve
lations
.
For
what
could
I
write
more
than
my
fathers
haye
written
?
For
have
not
they
revealed
the
plan
of
salvation
?
T
say
unto
you
,
Yea
;
and
this
sufliceth
me
.
Behold
,
it
is
expedient
that
much
should
be
done
among
this
people
,
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
,
and
.
the
deafness
of
their
cars
,
and
the
blindness
of
theiy
minds
,
and
the
stiffness
of
their
necks
;
nevertheless
,
God
is
exceeding
merciful
unto
them
,
and
hath
not
as
yet
siwept
them
off
frou
the
face
of
the
land
.
And
there
are
many
among
us
which
have
many
revelations
:
for
they
are
not
all
stiffneclked
.
And
as
many
as
are
not
stiffnecked
,
and
have
faith
,
have
commun
ion
with
the
Holy
Spirit
,
which
maketh
manifest
unto
the
chi
dren
of
men
,
according
to
their
faith
.
And
now
,
behold
,
two
hundred
years
had
passed
away
,
and
the
people
of
Nephi
had
waxed
strong
in
the
land
.
They
observed
to
keep
the
law
of
Moses
,
and
the
Sabbath
day
Holy
unto
the
Lord
,
And
they
profaned
not
;
acither
did
they
blas
pheme
.
And
the
Jaws
of
the
land
were
exceeding
strict
.
And
they
were
scattered
upon
much
of
the
face
of
the
and
;
and
the
Lamanites
also
.
And
they
were
exceeding
more
namerous
than
were
they
of
the
Nepbites
;
and
they
loved
murder
,
and
would
drink
the
blood
of
beasts
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
many
times
against
us
,
the
Nephites
,
to
battle
.
But
our
kings
and
our
leaders
were
mighty
men
in
the
faith
of
the
Lord
;
and
they
taught
the
peo
[File:151]
ple
the
ways
of
the
Lord
;
wherefore
,
we
withstood
the
Lamauites
,
and
swept
them
away
out
of
our
lands
,
and
began
tofortify
our
cities
,
or
whatsoever
place
of
owr
inheritance
.
And
we
multiplied
execedi
yy
and
spread
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
became
execeding
rich
in
gold
,
and
in
silver
,
and
.
in
precious
things
,
and
in
Gne
workmanship
of
wood
,
in
buildings
,
and
in
machinery
,
and
also
in
iron
,
and
copper
,
and
brass
,
and
steel
,
making
all
mauner
of
tools
of
every
kind
to
till
the
ground
,
and
weapons
of
war
;
yea
,
the
sharp
pointed
arrow
,
and
the
quiver
,
and
the
dart
,
and
the
javelin
,
and
all
preparations
for
war
;
and
thus
being
prepared
to
meet
the
Lamanites
,
they
did
not
prosper
against
us
.
But
the
word
of
the
Lord
was
verified
,
which
he
spake
unto
our
fathers
,
saying
,
That
inasmuch
as
ye
will
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
prophets
of
the
Lord
did
threaten
the
people
of
Nephi
,
according
to
the
word
of
God
,
that
if
they
did
not
keep
the
commandments
,
but
should
fall
ito
transgression
,
they
should
be
destroyed
from
off
the
face
of
the
land
;
wherefore
,
the
prophets
,
and
the
priests
,
and
the
teachers
,
did
labor
diligently
,
exhorting
,
with
all
long
suflering
,
the
people
to
diligence
;
teaching
the
law
of
Moses
,
and
the
intent
for
whigh
it
was
given
;
persuading
them
io
look
forward
unto
the
Messiah
,
and
believe
in
him
to
come
,
as
though
he
already
was
.
And
after
this
manner
did
they
teach
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
hy
so
doing
,
they
kept
them
from
being
destroyed
upon
the
face
of
the
land
;
for
they
did
prick
their
hearts
with
the
word
,
continually
stirring
them
up
unto
repentance
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
two
hundred
and
thirty
and
eight
years
had
passed
away
,
after
the
manner
of
wars
,
and
contentions
,
and
dissentions
,
for
the
space
of
much
of
the
time

kept
the
statutes
and
the
com
mandments
of
the
Lord
,
as
1
ought
to
have
done
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
two
hundred
and
seventy
and
years
had
passed
away
,
and
we
had
many
seasons
of
peace
and
we
had
many
seasons
of
serious
war
and
bloodshed
—
Yea
,
and
in
fine
,
two
hundred
and
eighty
and
two
years
hal
passed
away
,
and
I
had
kept
these
plates
according
to
fle
commandments
of
my
fathers
;
and
I
conferred
ther
upon
uy
son
Amaron
.
And
I
make
an
end
.
And
now
I
,
Amaron
,
write
the
things
whatsoever
I
write'
which
are
few
,
in
the
book
of
my
father
.
Behold
,
it
came
a
pass
that
three
hundred
and
twenty
years
had
passed
awa
,
and
the
more
wicked
part
of
the
Nephites
were
destroyed
:
fer
_
the
Lord
would
not
suiler
,
after
he
had
led
them
out
of
the
Jand
of
Jerusalem
,
and
kept
and
preserved
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
their
enciies
;
yea
,
he
would
not
suffer
tht
the
words
should
not
be
verified
,
which
he
spake
unto
out
fathers
,
saying
,
That
masmuch
as
ye
will
not
keep
my
com
mandments
,
ye
shall
not
prosper
in
the
land
.
Wherefore
,
the
Lord
did
visit
them
in
great
judgment
;
nevertheless
,
he
did
spare
the
righteous
,
that
they
should
not
perish
,
but
did
deli
ver
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
.
And
it
came
b
pass
that
I
did
deliver
the
plates
unto
my
brother
Qhemish
.
Now
I
,
Chemish
,
write
what
few
things
I
write
,
in
thesame
hook
with
my
brother
:
for
behold
,
1
saw
the
last
which
he
[File:153]
wrote
,
hat
he
wrote
it
with
his
own
hand
;
and
he
wrote
it
in
the
day
that
he
delivered
them
unto
me
.
And
after
this
manner
we
keep
the
records
:
for
it
is
according
10
ihe
commandments
of
our
fathers
:
And
I
make
an
end
.
Behold
,
I
,
Abinadom
,
1
am
the
son
of
Chemish
.
Behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
saw
much
war
and
contention
between
my
people
,
the
Nephites
,
and
the
Lamanites
;
and
J
,
with
mine
own
sword
,
have
taken
the
lives
of
many
of
the
Lamanites
,
in
the
defence
of
my
brethren
.
And
behold
,
the
record
of
this
people
is
engraven
upon
plates
which
is
had
by
the
kings
,
according
to
the
generations
;
and
I
know
of
no
revelation
,
save
that
which
has
been
writlen
,
neither
prophecy
;
wherefore
,
that
which
is
sufficient
,
is
written
.
And
I
make
an
end
.
Behold
,
I
am
Amaleki
,
the
son
of
Abinadom
.
Behold
,
1
will
speak
unto
you
somewhat
concerning
Mosiah
,
which
was
made
king
over
the
land
of
Zarahemla
:
for
behold
,
he
being
warned
of
the
Lord
that
he
should
flee
out
of
the
Jand
of
Nephi
,
and
as
many
as
would
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
Lord
,
should
also
depart
out
of
the
land
with
him
,
into
the
wilderness
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
according
as
the
Lord
had
commanded
him
.
And
they
departed
ont
of
the
land
into”
the
wilderness
,
as
many
as
would
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
Lord
;
and
they
were
Jed
by
many
preaching
and
proph
-
,
esyings
.
And
they
were
admonished
continually
by
the
word
of
-
God
;
and
they
were
led
by
the
power
of
his
arm
,
through
the
wilderness
,
until
they
came
down
into
the
land
which
is
_
called
the
land
of
Zaraberla
.
And
they
discovered
a
people
,
which
was
called
the
people
of
Zarahomla
.
Now
,
there
was
great
rejoicing
among
the
people
of
Zarahemla'
;
and
also
,
Zarahemla
did
rejoice
exceedingly
,
because
that
the
Lord
had
sent
the
people
of
Mosiah
with
the
plates
of
brass
which
contained
the
record
of
the
Jews
.
Behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
Mosiah
discovered
that
the
people
of
Zarahemla
,
came
out
from
Jerusalem
,
at
the
time
that
Zedekiah
,
king
of
Judah
,
was
carried
away
captive
into
Babylon
.
And
they
journied
inthe
wilderness
,
and
was
brought
hy
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
across
the
great
waters
,
info
the
Jand
where
Mosiah
discovered
them
;
and
they
had
dwelt
there
.
from
that
time
forth
.
And
at
the
time
that
Mosiah
discovered
them
,
they
had
become
exceeding
numerous
,
Nevertheless
,
they
had
had
many
wars
and
serious
contentions
,
and
had
fallen
by
the
sword
from
time
to
time
;
and
the
language
had
become
corrupted
;
and
they
had
broughtno
records
with
them
;
[File:154]
and
they
denied
the
being
of
their
Creator
;
and
Mosiah
,
noy
the
people
of
Mosiab
,
could
not
understand
then
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
Mosiab
caused
that
they
should
be
taught
in
his
language
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
were
taught
in
the
language
of
Mosiah
,
Zarahemla
gave
a
gene
ealogy
of
his
fathers
,
according
to
his
memory
;
and
they
are
wrilten
,
but
not
in
these
plates
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
Zarahemla
,
and
of
Musiah
,
did
unite
together
;
and
Mosiah
was
appoiuted
to
be
their
king
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
day's
of
Mosiah
,
there
was
a
large
stone
brought
unto
him
,
with
engravings
on
it
;
and
he
did
interpret
the
engravings
,
by
the
gift
and
power
of
God
,
And
they
gave
an
account
of
one
Coriantum
,
and
the
slain
of
his
people
,
And
Coriantaumr
was
discovered
by
the
people
of
Zarahemla
;
and
he
dwelt
with
them
for
the
space
of
nine
Moons
.
It
also
spake
a
few
words
concerning
his
fathers
And
his
first
parents
came
out
from
the
Tower
,
at
the
time
the
Lord
confounded
the
language
of
the
people
;
and
the
se
verity
of
the
Lord
fell
upon
them
,
according
to
his
judgments
,
which
is
just
;
and
their
bones
lay
scattered
in
the
land
north
.
ward
.
;
Behold
,
I
,
Amaleki
,
was
born
in
the
days
of
Mesiah
;
and
have
lived
to
see
his
death
;
and
Benjamin
,
his
son
,
rcigneth
in
his
stead
.
And
behold
,
I
have
seen
in
the
days
of
king
Benjamin
,
a
serieus
war
,
and
much
bloodshed
,
between
the
Nephites
and
the
Lamanites
,
But
behold
,
the
Nephites
did
obtain
much
advantage
over
them
;
yea
,
insomuch
that
king
Benjamin
did
drive
them
out
of
the
lund
of
Zarahemla
.
And
it
came'to
pass
that
I
began
to
be
old
;
and
,
having
no
seed
,
and
knowing
king
Benjamin
to
be
a
just
man
before
the
Lord
,
wherefore
,
I
shall
deliver
up
these
plates
unto
him
,
ex
horting
all
men
to
come
unto
God
,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
and
helieve
in
prophesying
,
and
in
revelations
,
and
in
the
minister
ing
of
Angels
,
and
in
the
gift
of
speaking
with
tongues
,
and
in
the
gift
of
interpreting
languages
in
all
things
which
is
good
:
for
there
is
nothing
which
is
good
,
save
it
comes
from
tbe
Lord
;
and
that
which
is
evil
,
cometh
from
the
Devil
.
A
And
now
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
would
that
ye
should
come
unto
Christ
,
which
is
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
and
partake
of
his
salvation
,
and
the
power
of
his
redemption
.
Yea
,
come
unto
him
,
and
offer
your
whole
souls
as
an
offering
unto
him
,
and
continue
in
fasting
and
praying
,
and
endure
to
the
end
;
and
as
the
Lord
liveth
,
ye
will
be
saved
,
[File:155]
And
now
,
L
would
speak
somewhat
concerning
a
certain
nuniber
which
went
up
into
the
wilderness
,
to
return
to
the
land
of
Nephi
:
for
there
was
a
large
number
which
were
desirous
to
possess
the
land
of
their
inheritance
;
wherefore
,
they
went
up
into
the
wilderness
.
_And
their
leader
being
a
strong
and
a
mighty
man
,
and
a
sttifhecked
man
,
wherefore
,
he
caused
a
contention
among
them
;
and
they
were
all
slain
,
save
fifty
,
in
the
wilderness
,
and
they
returned
again
to
the
land
of
Zaradhemia
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
also
took
others
,
to
a
conside
rable
number
,
and
took
their
journey
again
into
the
wilderness
.
And
I
,
Amaleki
,
hada
brother
,
which
also
went
with
them
;
and
[have
not
since
known
concerning
them
.
And
I
am
about
io
Jay
down
in
my
grave
;
and
these
plates
are
full
.
And
make
an
end
of
my
speaking

THE
WORDS
OF
MORMON
.
.
CHAPTER
I
.
.:
Axp
now
I
,
Mormon
,
being
about
to
deliver
up
the
rest
)
which
I
have
been
making
,
into
the
hands
of
my
son
Moroni
,
behold
,
I
have
witnessed
almost
all
the
destruction
of
my
people
,
ihe
Nephites
.
And
it
is
many
hundred
years
after
the
coming
of
Christ
,
that
I
deliver
these
records
into
the
hands
of
my
son
;
and
it
supposeth
me
that
he
will
witness
the
entire
destruction
of
my
people
.
But
may
God
grant
that
he
tay
survive
them
,
that
he
may
write
somewhat
.
concerning
them
,
and
somewhat
concerning
Christ
,
that
perhaps
some
day
it
may
profit
ther
.
;
And
now
,
!
speak
somewhat
concerning
that
which
I
have
written
:
for
afier
that
I
had
made
an
abridgment
from
the
plates
of
Nephi
,
down
to
the
reign
of
this
king
Benjamin
,
of
which
Amaleki
spake
,
I
searched
among
the
records
which
had
been
delivered
into
my
hands
,
and
1
found
these
plates
,
which
contained
this
small
account
of
the
Prophets
,
from
Jacob
,
down
to
the
reign
of
this
king
Benjamin
;
and
also
,
many
of
the
words
of
Nephi
.
And
the
things
which
are
upon
these
plates
pleasing
me
,
because
of
the
prophecies
of
the
coming
_
of
Christ
;
and
my
fathers
knowing
that
many
of
them
have
Pgs
ee
oa
,
[File:156]
been
fulfilled
;
yea
,
and
I
also
know
that
as
many
things
ag
have
been
prophesied
concerning
us
down
to
this
day
,
hi
been
fulfilled
;
and
as
many
as
go
beyond
this
day
,
must
surely
come
to
pass
;
wherefore
,
]
chose
these
things
,
to
finish
m
record
upon
them
,
which
remainder
of
my
record
I
shall
take
from
the
plates
of
Nephi
;
and
I
caunot
write
a
hundredth
yay
,
Pee
things
of
my
people
.
But
behold
,
I
sball
take
these
plates
,
which
contain
thes
prophecyings
and
revelations
,
and
put
them
with
the
remain
der
of
my
record
,
for
they
are
choice
unto
me
;
and
J
knoy
they
will
be
choice
unto
my
brethren
.
And
I
do
this
fora
tvise
purpose
;
for
thus
it
whispereth
me
,
according
to
the
workings
of
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
which
is
in
me
.
And
now
,
Ido
not
know
all
things
;
but
the
Lord
knoweth
all
thing
which
is
to
come
;
wherefore
,
he
worketh
in
me
to
do
acco
.
ding
to
his
will
.
And
my
prayer
to
God
,
is
concerning
iy
brethren
,
that
they
may
once
again
come
to
the
knowledge
of
God
;
yeu
,
the
redemption
of
Christ
;
that
they
may
one
-
again
bea
delightsome
people
.
_
And
now
I
,
Mormon
,
proceed
to
finish
out
my
record
,
whid
a}
ake
from
the
plates
of
Nephi
;
and
I
make
it
according
the
knowledge
and
the
understanding
which
God_
hath
giva
ic
.
Wherefore
,
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Amaleki
bad
dd
:
ved
up
these
plates
into
the
hands
of
king
Benjamin
,
he
took
them
and
put
themawith
the
other
plates
,
which
contained
me
cords
which
had
been
handed
down
by
the
kings
,
from
gene
vation
to
generation
,
until
the
days
of
king
Benjamin
;
ant
they
were
handed
down
from
king
Benjamin
,
from
generatiot
to
generation
,
until
they
have
fallen
into
my
hands
.
And]
Mormon
,
pray
to
God
that
they
may
he
preserved
,
from
this
time
hence
forth
.
And
I
know
that
they
will
be
preserved
!
for
there
are
great
{hings
written
upon
them
,
out
of
which
my
people
and
their
brethren
,
shall
be
judged
at
the
great
and
lat
.
day
,
according
to
the
word
of
God
which
is
written
.
And
now
,
concerning
this
king
Benjamin
:
He
had
some
-
What
contentions
among
his
own
people
.
And
it
came
to
pas
also
,
that
the
armics
of
the
Lamanites
came
down
out
of
the
land
of
Nephi
,
to
battle
against
his
people
.
But
behold
,
lag
Benjamin
gathered
together
his
armies
,
and
he
did
stand
agail#
them
;
and
he
did
fight
with
the
strength
of
his
own
arm
,
wih
the
sword
of
Laban
;
and
in
the
strength
of
the
ord
they
il
contend
against
their
enemies
,

they
had
slain

against
the
Lamanites
,
until
they
had
driven
them
out
of
all
the
lands
of
their
inheritance
.
And
itcame
to
pass
that
after
there
had
been
false
Christs
,
and
their
mouths
had
been
shut
,
and
they
punished
according
to
their
crimes
;
and
after
there
had
been
false

,
and

false
preachers
and
teachers
among
the
people
,
and
all
these

according

their
crimes
;
and
after
there
having
been
much
contentions
and
many
dissentions
,
away
unto
the
Lamanites
,
behold
,
1t
came
to
pass
that
king
Benjamin
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
Holy
Prophets
whic
were
among
his
people
:
for
behold
,
king
Benjamin
was
a
holy
man
,
and
he
did
reign
over
his
people
in
righteousness
.
And
.
there
were
many
holy
men
in
the
land
;
and
they
did
speak
the
word
of
God
,
with
power
and
with
authority
;
and
they
did
use
much
sharpness
,
because
of
the
stiffneckedness
of
the
people
;
wherefore

with
the
help
of
these

king
Benjamin

laboring
with
all

for
even
at

time

my

tremble
exceedingly

while

to
speak
unto
you

by
the
Lord
God

and

should

F
shoill

unto

this
day
,
that
my
son
Mosiah
,
is
a
king
atl
aruler
over
you
.
And
now
,
my
brethren
,
I
would
that
ye
should
do
asye
hitherto
done
.
As
ye
have
kept
my
commandments
,
and
as
!
the
commandments
of
my
father
,
and
have
prospered
,

have
been
kept
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
your
enenit
even
so
if
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of
my

ot

of
God
,
which
shall
be
delivered
unto
you
him
,
ye
shall
prosper
in

,
and
your
enemies
shall
hi
no
power
over
you

But
O
my
people
,
beware
lest
there
sil
arise
contentions
among
you
,
and
ye
list
to
obey
the
evil
vit
,
which
was
spoken
of
by
my
father
Mosiah
.
For
belt
[File:163]
there
is
a
Wo
pronounced
upon
him
who
listeth
to
obey
,
that
epinit
;
for
if
he
listeth
to
obey
him
,
and
renaineth
and
dieth
in
his
sins
,
the
same
drinketh
damnation
to
his
own
soul
;
for
he
receiveth
for
his
wages
an
everlasting
punishment
,
having
transgressed
the
law
of
God
,
contrary
to
his
own
.
knowledge
.
I
say
unto
you
,
thatibere
are
not
.
one
among
you
,
except
it
be
your
little
children
,
that
have
not
been
taught
concerning
these
things
5
but
what
knoweth
that
ye
are
eternally
indebted
to
your
Heavenly
Father
,
torendcr
to
him
ullthatyou
have
,
and
are
,
and
also
have
been
taught
,
concerning
the
records
which
contain
the
prophecies
which
hath
been
spoken
hy
the
Holy
Prophets
,
even
down
to
the
time
our
father
Lehi
left
Jerusalem
;
and
also
,
ali
that
hath
been
spoken
by
our
fathers
,
until
ww
.
And
behold
,
also
,
they
spake
that
which
was
commanded
them
of
the
Lord
;
therefore
,
they
are
just
and
true
.
And
now
,
I
say
unto
you
,
my
brethren
,
that
after
ye
have
known
and
have
been
taught
all
these
things
,
if
ye
should
transgress
,
and
go
contrary
to
that
which
hath
been
spoken
,
that
ye
do
,
withdraw
yourselves
from
the
Spirit
of
the
Lord
,
that
it
may
have
no
place
in
you
to
guide
you
in
wisdom's
paths
,
that
ye
may
be
blessed
,
prospered
,
and
preserved
.
I
say
unto
you
,
that
the
mam
that
doeth
this
,
the
same
cometh
out
inopen
rebellion
against
God
;
therefore
,
he
listeth
to
obey
the
evil
spirit
,
and
becometh
an
enemy
to
all
righteousness
5
therefore
,
the
Lord
hath
no
place
in
him
,
for
he
dwelleth
not
inunholy
temples
.
Therefore
,
if
that
man
repenteth
not
,
and
rmaineth
and
dieth
an
enemy
to
God
,
the
demands
of
Divine
Justice
doth
awalcen
his
immortalsoul
to
a
lively
sense
of
his
avn
guilt
,
which
doth
cause
him
to
shrink
from
the
presence
ofthe
Lord
,
and
doth
fill
his
breast
with
guilt
,
and
pain
,
and
anguish
,
which
is
like
an
unquenchable
fire
,
whose
flames
aseendeth
up
forever
and
ever
,
And
now
I
say
unto
you
,
that
uercy
hath
no
claim
on
that
man
;
therefore
,
bis
final
doom
is
to
endure
a
never
ending
torment
.
O
all
ye
old
men
,
and
also
ye
young
men
,
and
you
little
children
,
which
can
understand
my
words
,
(
fer
I
have
spoken
plain
unto
you
,
that
ye
might
understand
,)
I
pray
that
ye
should
awake
10
a
remembrance
of
the
awful
situation
of
thoze
that
have
fallen
into
transgresston
;
and
moreover
,
would
,
desirethat
ye
should
consider
on
the
bles
and
happy
state
of
those
that
keep
the
commandments
of
God
.
for
beheld
,
they
are
blessed
in
all

to
none
such

except
it
be
through
repentance
and
fait
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
.
And
the
Lord
God
hath
sent
his
Holy
Prophets
among
all
the
children
of
meh
,
to
declare
these
things
to
every
kindred
,
nation
,
and
tongue
,
that
thereby
whosoever
should
believe
that
Christ
should
come
,
the
same
might
receive
remission
of
their
sins
,
and
rejoice
with
exceeding
great
joy
,
even
as
though
he
had
already
come
among
them
.
Yet
the
Lord
.
God
saw
that
his
people
were
a
atiffnecked
people
,
and
he
appointed
,
unto
them
a
Jaw
,
even
the
law
of
Moses
.
And
many
signs
,
and
wonders
,
and
types
,
and
shadows
shewed
he
unto
them
,
concerning
hiscomimg
;
and
also
Holy
Prophets
spake
unto
them
concerning
bis
coming
;
and
yet
they
hardened
their
hearts
,
and
understood
not
that
the
law
of
Moses
availeth
nothing
,
except
it
were
through
the
atonement
of
his
bloou
;
and
even
if
it
were
possible
that
little
children
could
sin
,
they
could
not
be
saved
;
but
I
say
unto
yon
,
they
are
blessed
:
for
behold
,
as
in
Adam
,
or
by
nature
they
fall
,
even
xo
the
blood
of
Christ
atoneth
for
their
sins
.
And
morcoyer
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
there
shall
be
no
other
name
given
,
nor
no
ather
way
nor
means
whereby
salvation
can
come
unto
the
children
of
men
,
only
in
and
through
the
name
of
Christ
,
the
Lord
Omnipotent
.
for
behold
,
he
juidgeth
,
and
his
judgment
is
just
,
and
.
the
infant
perisheth
not
,
that
dieth
in
his
infancy

bat
men
drinketh
damnation
to
their
own
souls
,
except
they
tumble
themselves
,
and
become
as
little
children
,
and
believet
!
that
salvation
was
,
and
is
,
and
is
.
to
come
,
in
and
through
the
atoning
blood
of
Christ
,
the
Lord
Oninipotent
:
for
the
natural
man
is
an
enemy
to
God
,
and
has
been
,
from
the
fall
of
Adam
,
and
will
be
,
ferever
and
ever
;
but
if
he
yieldeth
to
the
enticings
ofthe
Toly
Spirit
,
and
putteth
off
the
natural
man
,
and
becometh
a
saint
,
through
the
atonement
of
Christ
,
the
Lord
,
and
becometh
asa
child
,
submissive
,
meek
,
humble

patient

full
:
of
love
,
willing
to
submit
to
all
things
which
the
Lord
seeth
fit
to
inflict
upon
ban
,
evenas
a
child
doth
submit
to
his
father
.
And
moreover
,
I
say
wito
you
,
that
the
time
shall
come
,
when
the
knowledge
of
a
Saviour
shall
spread
throughout
every
nation
,
kindred
,
tongue
,
and
people
.
And
behold
,
when
that
.
time
cometh
,
none
shall
be
found
blameless
before
God
,
exeept
it
be
litte
children
,
only
through
repentance
and
faith
on
the
name
of
the
Lord
God
Omnipotent
;
and
even
at
this
time
,
when
thou
shalt
have
taught
thy
people
the
things
which
the
Lord
thy
God
hath
commanded
thee
,
even
then
are
they
found
[File:166]
aio
more
blameless
in
the
sight
of
God
,
only
according
to
the
words
which
I
have
spoken
unto
thee
.
And
now
,
I
have
spoken
the
words
which
the
Lord
God
hath
commanded
me
.
And
thus
saith
the
Lord
:
They

at

to
his
works
,
whether
they
be
good
,
or
whether
they
by
evil
;
and
if
they
be
evil
,
they
are
consigned
to
an
awful
view
of
their
own
guilt
and
abominations
,
which
doth
cause
then
to
shrink
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
,
into
a
state
of
misery
and
endless
torment
,
from
whence
they
can
no
more
return
;
therefore
,
they
have
drunk
damnation
to
their
own
souls
—
Therefore
,
theyhave
drunk
out
of
the
cup
of
the
wrath
of
God
which
justice
could
no
more
deny
unto
them
,
than
it
could
de
ny
that
Adam
should
fall
,
because
of
his
partaking
of
the
for
bidden
fruit
;
therefore
,
merey
could
have
claim
on
them
19
more
forever

And
their
torment
is
asa
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
,
whose
flames
are
unquenchable

whose

a
a
CHAPTER
IL
.
Anp
Row
,
it
came
to
pass
that
when
king
Benjamin
hal
made
an
end
of
speaking
the
words
which
had
been
delivered
unto
him
by
the
Angel
of
the
Lord
,
that
he
cast
his
eyes
rout
about
on
the
multitude
,
and
behold
,
they
had
fell
to
the
earth
for
the
fear
of
the
Lord
had
come
upon
them
;
and
they
had
viewed
themselves
in
their
own
carnal
state
,
even
less
that
the
dust
of
the
earth
.
And
they
all
cried
aloud
with
one
voice
,
saying
,
O
have
mercy
,
and
apply
the
atoning
blood
af
Christ
,
that
we
may
receive
forgiveness
of
our
sins
,
and
of
hearts
may
be
purified
:
for
we
believe
in
Jesus
Christ
,
the
Son
of
God
,
who
created
Heaven
and
earth
,
and
all
thingy
who
shall
come
down
among
the
children
of
mex
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
spoken
these
words
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
came
upon
them
,
and
they
were
filled
with
joy
,
having
received
a
remission
of
their
sins
,
and
having
oe
of
conscience
,
because
of
the
exceeding
faith
which
they
ad
in
Jesus
Christ
which
should
come
,
according
to
the
words
which
king
Benjamin
had
spoken
unto
them
.
And
[File:167]
king
Benjamin
again
opened
his
mouth
,
and
began
to
speak
unto
them
,
saying
,
My
inends
and
my
brethren
,
my
kindred
and
my
people
,

would
again
cali
your
attention
,
that
ye
may
hear
and
understand
the
remainder
of
my
words
which
I
shall
speak
unto
you
:
for
behold
,
that
if
the
knowledge
of
the
goodness
of
God
at
this
time
,
hath
awakened
you
to
a
sense
of
your
nothingness
,
and
your
worthless
and
fallen
state
;
I
say
unto
you
,
that
if
ye
have
come
to
a
knowledge
of
the
goodness
of
God
,
and
his
matchless
power
,
and
his
wisdom
,
and
his
patience
,
and
his
long
sulfering
towards
the
children
of
men
,
and
also
,
the
atonement
which
hath
been
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
,
that
thereby
salvation
might
come
to
him
that
should
put
his
trust
in
the
Lord
,
and
should
be
diligent
in
keeping
his
commandments
,
and
continue
in
the
faith
even
unto
the
end
of
his
life
;
I
mean
the
life
of
the
mortalbody
;
I
say
,
that
this
is
the
man
that
receiveth
salvation
,
through
the
atonement
which
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
,
for
all
mankind
,
which
ever
was
ever
since
the
fall
of
Adam
,
or
which
is
or
which
ever
shall
be
,
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
;
and
this
is
the
means
whereby
salvation
cometh
.
And
there
is
none
other
salvation
,
save
this
which
hath
been
spoken
of
;
neither
is
there
any
conditions
whercby
man
can
be
saved
,
except
the
conditions
which
J
have
told
you
.
Belicve
in
God
;
believe
that
he
is
,
and
that
he
created
all
things
,
both
in
Heaven
and
in
Earth
;
believe
that
he
hath
all
wisdom
,
and
all
power
,
both
in
Heayen
and
in
arth
;
believe
that
man
doth
not
comprehend
all
the
things
which
the
Lord
can
comprehend
.
And
again
:
Believe
that
ye
must
repent
of
your
sins
and
forsake
them

And

I

unto

which
causeth
such
exceeding
great
joy
in

even

I
would
that
ye
should

and
always

the
greatness
of
God

and
your
own
nothingness

and
his

long

towards
you
unworthy

and
humble
yourselves
even
in
the

of
humility

and
standing
steadfastly
in

of

of
Him
that
created

And
ye
will
not

,
but
to
live
peaceably
,
and
to

And
ye
will
not

your
children
,
that
they
go
hungry
,
or
naked
;
neither
will
ye
suffer
that
they
transgress

laws
of
God
,
and
fight
and
quarrel
one
with

,
and
serve
the
Devil
,
which
is
the
taster
of

,
or
which
is
the
evil
spirit
which
hath
been
spoken
of
by
our
fathers
;
he
being
an
enemy
to
all
righteousness
;
but
ye
will
teach
them
to
walk
in
the
ways
of
truth

soberness
;
ye
will
teach

them

to

;
and
also
,
ye
yourselves
will
succor

that

af

succor
;
ye
will
adminster
of
your
substance
unto
bin
that
standeth
in
need
;
and
ye
will
not
suffer
that
the
beggar
putteth
up
his
petition
to
you
in
vain
,
and
turn
him
out
to
perish
.
Perhaps
thou
shalt
say
,
The
man
hath
brought
upon
himself
his
misery
,
therefore
I
will
stay
my
hand
,
and
will
not
give
vanto
him
of
my
food
,
nor
impart
unto
him
of
my
substance
,
that
he
may
not
suffer
,
for
his
punishments
are
just
.
But
Isay
unto
you
,
O
man
,
whosoever
doeth
this
,
the
same
hath
gret
gause
to
repent
;
and
except
he
repenteth
of
that
which
he
hah
done
,
he
perisheth
forever
,
and
hath
no
interest
in
the
kingdon
ef
God
.
For
behold
,
are
we
not
all
beggars
?
Do
we
not
dl
depend
upon
the
same
being
,
even
God
,
for
all
the
substance
which
we
have
;
for
both
food
,
and
raiment
,
and
for
gold
,
and
for
silver
,
and
for
all
the
riches
which
we
have
of
every
kint
!
And
behold
,
even
at
this
time
,
ye
have
been
calling
on
his
name
,
and
begging
for
a
remission
of
your
sins
.
And
hath
he
sufler
ed
that
ye
have
begged
in
vain
?
Nay
;
he
hath
poured
outhis
spirit
upon
you
,
and
hath
caused
that
your
hearts
should
be
filled
with
joy
,
and
hath
caused
that
your
mouths
should
te
stopped
,
that
ye
could
not
find
utterance
,
so
exceeding
great
was
your
joy
.
And
now
,
if
God
,
who
hath
created
you
,
whoin
you
are
dependant
for
your
lives
,
and
for
all
that
ye
have
and
are
,
doth
grant
unto
you
whatsoever
ye
ask
that
i
right
,
in
faith
,
believing
that
ye
shall
receive
,
O
then
,
how
had
ye
ought
to
impart
of
the
substance
that
ye
have
,
one
1
another
?
And
if
ye
judge
the
man
who
putteth
up
his
petition
io
you
for
your
substance
,
that
he
perish
not
,
and
condemt
him
,
how
much
more
just
will
be
your
condemnation
,
for
will
holding
your
substance
,
which
doth
not
belong
to
you
,
but
t#
[File:169]
God
,
to
whom
also
,
your
life
belongeth
;
and
yet
ye
put
up
no
etition
,
or
repenteth
not
of
the
thing
which
thou
hast
done
.—
Tsay
uuto
you
,
Wo
be
unto
that
man
,
for
his
substance
shall
perish
with
him
;
and
now
,
I
say
these
things
unto
those
which
are
rich
,
as
pertaining
to
the
things
of
this
world
.
And
again
,
T
say
unto
the
poor
,
ye
that
have
not
and
yet
hath
sufficient
,
that
ye
remain
from
day
to
day
;
I
mean
all
you
that
deny
the
beggar
,
because
ye
have
not
;
1
would
that
ye
say
in
your
hearts
,
that
I
give
not
because
I
have
not
;
but
if
I
had
,
I
would
give
.
And
now
,
if
ye
say
this
in
your
hearts
,
ye
remain
guiltless
,
otherwise
ye
are
condemned
,
and
your
condemnation
is
just
:
for
ye
covet
that
which
ye
have
not
received
.
And
now
,
for
the
sake
of
these
things
which
I
have
spoken
.
anto
you
;
thatis
,
for
the
sake
of
retaining
a
remission
of
your
sins
from
day
to
day
,
that
ye
may
walk
guiltless
before
God
,
f
would
that
ye
should
impart
of
your
substance
to
the
poor
,
every
man
according
to
that
which
he
hath
,
such
as
feeding
the
hungry
,
clothing
the
naked
,
visiting
the
sick
,
and
administering
to
their
relief
,
both
spiritually
and
temporally
,
according
fo
their
wants
,
and
see
that
all
these
things
are
done
in
wisdom
and
order
:
for
it
is
not
requisite
that
a
man
should
run
faster
than
what
he
hath
strength
,
And
again
:
It
is
expedient
that
he
should
he
diligent
,
that
thereby
he
might
win
the
prize
;
therefore
,
all
things
must
be
done
in
order
.
.
And
,
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
,
that
whosoever
among
you
that
borroweth
of
his
neighbor
,
should
return
the
thing
that
he
borroweth
,
according
as
he
doth
agree
,
or
else
thou
shalt
commit
sin
,
and
perhaps
thou
shalt
cause
thy
neighbor
to
commie
sin
also
,
And
finally
,
I
cannot
tell
you
all
the
things
whereby
ye
may
commit
sin
:
for
there
are
divers
ways
and
means
,
even
so
many
,
that
I
cannot
number
them
.
But
this
much
I
can
tell
you
,
that
if
ye
do
not
watch
yourselves
,
and
your
thoughts
,
and
your
words
,
and
your
deeds
,
and
observe
to
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
continue
in
the
faith
of
what
ye
have
heard
concerning
the
coming
of
our
Lord
,
even
unto
the
end
of
your
lives
,
ye
must
perish
.
And
now
,
O
man
,
re
member
,
and
perish
not
,

CHAPTER
HL
Anp
now
,
it
came
to
pass
that
when
king
Benjamin
had
thug
spoken
to
his
people
,
he
sent
among
them
,
desiring
to
knoy
of
his
people
,
If
they
believed
the
words
which
he
had
spoken
unto
them
.
And
they
all
cried
with
one
voice
,
saying
,
Yea
,
we
believe
all
the
words
which
thou
hast
spoken
unto
us
;
and
also
,
we
know
of
their
surety
and
truth
,
because
of
the
Spirit
of
the
Lord
Omnipotent
,
which
hath
wrought
a
mighty
change
in
us
,
or
in
our
hearts
,
that
we
have
no
more
disposition
to
do
evil
,
but
to
do
good
continually
.
And
we
,
ourselves
,
also
,
through
the
infinite
goodness
of
God
,
and
the
manifestations
of
his
Spirit
,
have
great
views
-
of
that
which
is
to
come
;
and
were
it
expedient
,
we
could
prophesy
of
ail
things
.
And
itis
the
faith
which
we
have
had
on
the
things
Which
our
king
hath
spoken
unto
us
,
and
hath
brought
us
to
this
great
knowledge
,
whereby
we
do
rejoice
with
such
exceeding
great
joy
;
and
we
are
willing
to
enter
into
a
covenant
with
our
God
,
to
do
his
will
and
to
be
obedient
to
his
commandments
in
all
things
that
be
shall
command
us
,
all
the
remainder
of
our
days
,
that
we
may
not
bring
upon
ourselves
a
never
ending
torment
,
as
has
bea
spoken
by
the
Angel
,
that
we
may
not
drink
out
of
the
cup
of
the
wrath
of
God
.
_
And
now
,
these
are
the
words
which
king
Benjamin
desired
of
them
;
and
therefore
he
said
unto
them
,
Ye
have
spoken
the
words
that
I
desired
;
and
the
covenant
which
ye
have
made
,
isa
righteous
covenant
.
And
now
,
because
of
the
covenant
which
¥e
have
made
,
ye
shall
be
called
the
children
of
Chris
his
sons
,
and
his
daughters
:
for
behold
,
this
day
he
hath
spi
ritually
begotten
you
;
for
ye
say
that
your
hearts
are
changed
,
through
faith
on
his
name
;
therefore
,
ye
are
born
of
him
,
ant
laye
become
his
sons
,
and
his
daughters
.
And
under
this
head
,
yeare
made
free
;
and
there
is
no
other
head
whereby
ye
cat
be
made
free
.
There
is
no
other
name
given
,
whereby
salvation
cometh
;
therefore
,
I
would
that
ye
should
take
upon
you
the
name
of
Christ
,
all
you
that
have
entered
into
the
covenat
!
with
God
,
that
ye
should
be
obedient
unto
the
end
of
your
lives
.
”
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
docth
this
,
shall
be
found
at
the
righthand
of
God
,
for
he
shall
know
the
name
by
which
he
is
called
:
for
he
shall
be
called
by
the
name
of
Christ
.
And
now
,
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
shall
not
fake
upon
them
the
name
of
Christ
,
must
be
called
-
by
some
[File:171]
ether
name
;
therefore
,
he
findeth
himself
on
the
left
hand
of
God
.
And
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
also
,
that
this
is
the
name
that
I
said
I
should
give
unio
you
,
that
never
should
be
blotted
out
,
execpt
it
be
through
transgression
;
therefore
,
take
heed
that
ye
do
not
transgress
,
that
the
name
he
not
blotted
out
of
your
bearts
.
[say
unto
you
,
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
to
retain
the
name
written
always
in
your
hearts
,
that
ye
are
not
found
on
the
left
hand
of
God
,
but
that
ye
hear
and
know
the
voice
by
which
ye
shall
be
called
,
and
also
,
the
name
by
which
he
shall
call
you
:
for
,
how
knoweth
a
man
the
master
which
he
hath
not
served
,
and
which
is
a
stranger
unto
him
,
and
is
far
from
the
thoughts
and
intents
of
his
heart
?
And
again
:
Doth
a
man
take
an
ass
which
belongeth
to
bis
neighbor
,
and
keep
him
?
1
say
unto
you
,
Nay
;
he
will
not
even
suffer
that
he
shall
feed
among
his
flocks
,
but
will
drive
him
away
,
and
cast
him
out
.
I
say
unto
you
,
that
even
so
shall
it
be
among
you
,
if
ye
know
not
the
name
by
which
ye
are
called
,
Therefore
,
I
would
that
ye
should
be
steadfast
and
immovable
,
always
abounding
in
good
works
,
that
Christ
,
the
Lord
God
Omnipotent
,
may
seal
you
his
,
that
you
may
be
brought
to
Heaven
,
that
ye
may
have
everlasting
salvation
and

life
,
through
the
wisdom

and
power
,
and

justice

and

of
Him

that

should

who

what
had

ANn
now
,
it
came
to
pass
that
after
king
Mosiah
had
bai
continual
peace
,
for
the
space
of
three
years
,
he
was
desirous
to
know
cencerning
the
people
which
went
up
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
Lehi
-
Nephi
,
or
in
the
city
of
Lehi
-
Nephi
:
for
his
pee
le
had
heard
nothing
from
them
,
from
the
time
they
left
the
md
of
Zarahemla
;
therefore
,
they
wearied
him
with
thet
teasings
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Mosiah
granted
that
sixteci
of
their
strong
men
might
go
up
to
the
land
of
Lehi

Nephi
,
to
inquire
concerning
their
brethren
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
,
they
started
to
go
up
,
having
with
them
one
Ammon
,
he
being
a
strong
and
mighty
man
,
and
a
descendantof

;
and
he
was
elo
their
leader

And
now
,
they
knew
not
the
course
they
should
travel
in
the
wil
demess
,
to
go
up

-
Nephi
;
therefore
,
they
wandered
many
days
in
the
wilderness
,
even
forty
days
did
they
wander
.
And
when
they
had
wandered
forty
days
,
they
came
to
a
hill
,
which
is
north
of
the
land
of
Shilom
,
and
there
they
pitched
their
tents
.
And
Ammon
took
three
of
his
bretlren
,
and
their
names
were
Amaleki
,
Helem
,
and
Hem
,
and
they
Went
down
into

Nephi
;
and
behold
,
they
met
the

Ring
of
the
people
,
which
was
in
the
land
of
Nephi
,
and
in
the
land
of
Shilom
;
and
they
were
surrounded
by
the
king's
guard
,
and
was
taken
,
and
was
bound
,
and
was
committed
to
prison
,
And
it
came
to
pass
when
they
had
been
in
prison
two
days
,
they
were
again
brought
before
the
king
,
and
their
bands
were

loosed
;
and
they
stood
before
the
king
,
and
was
permitted
,
ov
yather
commanded
that
they
should
answer
the
questions
which
he
should
ask
them
.
And
he
saith
unto
them
,
Behold
,
¥
am
Limhi
,
the
son
of
Noah
,
which
was
the
son
of
Zeniff
,
which
came
up
out
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
to
inherit
this
land
,
which
was
the
Jand
of
their
fathers
,
which
was
made
a
king
by
the
voice
of
the
people
.
And
now
,
J
desire
to
know
the
cause
whercby
ye
were
so
bold
as
to
come
near
the
walls
of
the
city
,
when
J
,
myself
,
was
with
my
guards
,
without
the
gate
?
And
now
,
for
this
cause
have
I
suticred
that
ye
should
be
preserved
,
that
1
might
inquire
of
you
,
or
else
I
should
have
caused
that
my
guards
should
have
put
you
to
death
.—
Ye
are
permitted
to
speak
.
Andnow
,
when
Ammon
saw
that
he
was
permitted
to
speak
,
he
went
forth
and
bowed
himsclf
before
the
king
;
and
msing”
again
,
he
said
,
O
king
,
lam
very
thankful
before
God
this
day
,
that
Iam
yet
alive
;
and
am
permitted
to

;
and
I
.
will
endeavor
to
speak
with
boldness
:
for
Lam
assured
that
if
ye
had
known
ie
,
ye
would
not
have
suffered
that
I
should
have

these

For

and

of

(
o
inquire
concerning
our
brethren
,
which
Zeniff
brought
up
out
of
that
land
.
And
now
,
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Limhi
bad
heard
the
words
of
Ammon
,
he
was
exceeding
glad
,
and
said
,
Now
,
1
know
of
a
surety
that
my
brethren
which
was
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
are
yet
alive
.
And
now
,
I
will
rejoice
;
and
on
the
morrow
,
I
will
cause
that
my
people
shall
rejoice
also
.
For
behold
,
we
are
im
bondage
to
the
Lamanites
,
and
are
taxed
with
a
tax
which
is
grievous
to
be
borne
.
And
now
,
behold
,
our
brethren
will
deliver
us
out
of
our
bondage
,
or
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
we
will
be
their
slaves
:
for
it
is
better
that
we
be
slaves
to
the
Nephites
,
than
to
pay
tribute
to
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
now
,
king
Limhi
commanded
his
guards
that
they'
.
should
no
more

,
nor

,
but

should

acy
;
for
they
had
suffered
many
things
:
they
had
sutferg
~
hunger
,
thirst
,
and
fatigue
.
And
now
,
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
,
that
king
Lim
sent
a
proclamation
among
all
his
people
,
that
thereby
they
aight
gather
themselves
together
to
the
temple
,
to
hear
the
words
which
he
should
speak
unto
them
.
And
it
came
tp
pass
that
when
they
had
gathered
themselves
together
,
tha
he
spake
unto
them
in
this
wise
,
saying
,
O
ye
,

be

:

glings
,
which
have
been
in
vain
;
yet
I
trust
there
remaineth
an
cffectual
struggle
to
be
made
.
Therefore
,
lift
up
your
heads
,
and
rejoice
,
and
put
your
trust
in
God
,
in
that
God
wh
was
the
God
of
Abraham
,
and
Isaac
,
and
Jacob
;
and
also
,
that
God
who
brought
the
Children
of
Israel
out
of
the
land
of
igypt
,
and
caused
that
they
should
walk
through
the
Red
Sea
on
dry
ground
,
and
fed
them
with
manna
,
that
they
might
not
perish
in
the
wilderness
;
and
many
more
things
did
he
do
forthem
.
And
again
:
That
same
God
hath
brought
our
fathas
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
and
hath
kept
and
preserved
his
people
,
even
until
now
.
And
behold
,
it
is
because
of
our
ini

quities
and

,
that
has
brought

into

for

And

And
is

Now
behold

how

have

,
and
all
because
of
iniquity
.
For
if
this
peopl
[File:175]
had
not
fallen
into
transgression
,
the
Lord
would
not
have
suffered
that
this
great
evil
should
comd
upon
them
.
But
behold
,
they
would
not
hearken
unto
his
words
;
but
there
arose
contentions
among
them
,
even
so
much
that
they
did
shed
blood
among
themselves
.
And
a
Prophet
of
the
Lord
have
they
slain
;
yea
,
a
chosen
man
of
God
,
who
told
them
of
their
wickedness
and
abominations
,
and
prophesied
of
many
things
which
is
to
come
,
yea
,
even
the
coming
of
Christ
.
And
because
he
saith
unto
them
,
That
Christ
was
the
God
,
the
Father
of
all
things
,
and
saith
that
he
should
take
upon
him
the
image
of
man
,
and
it
should
be
the
image
after
which
man
was
created
in
the
beginning
;
or
in
other
words
,
he
said
that
man
was
created
after
the
image
of
God
,
and
that
God
should
come
down
among
the
children
of
men
,
and
take
upon
him
flesh
and
blood
,
and
go
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
;
and
now
,
because
he
said
this
,
they
did
put
him
to
death
;
and
maay
more
things
did
they
do
,
which
brought
down
the
wrath
of
God
upon
them
,
Therefore
,
who
wondereth
that
they
are
in
bondage
,
and
that
they
are
smitten
with
sore
afflictions
?
Forbehold
,
the
Lord
hath
said
,
I
will
not
succor
my
people
in
the
day
of
their
transgression
;
but
I
will
hedge
up
their
ways
,
that
they
prosper
not
;
and
their
doings
shall
be
as
a
stumblingfy
block
before
them
.
And
again
:
He
saith
,
If
my
people
shalt
sow
filthiness
,
they
shall
reap
the
chaff
thereof
,
in
the
whirlwind
;
and
the
effects
thereof
,
is
poison
.
And
again
:
He
saith
,
If
my
people
shall
sow
filthiness
,
they
shall
reap
the
east
wind
,
which
bringeth
immediate
destruction
.
And
now
,
behold
,
the
promise
of
the
Lord
is
fulfilled
;
and
ye
are
smitten
,
and
afificted
.
But
if
ye
will
turn
to
the
Lord
with
full
purpose
of
heart
,
and
put
your
trust
in
him
,
and
serve
him
with
all
diligence
of
mind
;
and
if
ye
do
this
,
he
will
,
according
to
his
own
will
and
pleasure
,
deliver
you
out
of
bondage
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
king
Limhi
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
to
his
people
,
for
he
spake
many
things
unto
them
,
and
only
a
few
of
them

,
he
told
his
people
all
the
things
concerning
their
brethren
which
were
inthe
land
of
Zarahemla
;
and
he
caused
that
Ammon
should
stand
up
before
the
multitude
,
and
rehearse
unto
them
all
that
had
happened
unto
their
brethren
,
from
the
time
that
Zenifl
went
up
out
of
the
land
,
even
until
the
time
that
he
,
himself
came
up
out
of
the
land
.
_
And
he
also
rehearsed
unto
then
the
last
words
which

Benjamin
hed
taught
them
,
md
explained
them
te
the
people
of

and
-
caused
that
they
should

unto

,
And
it
came
to

that
he

that

from
the
time
that

that

Now
,
as

the

into

,
that
thereby
they
might
find
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
that
we
might
appeal
unto
our
brethren
to
deliver
us
out
of

;
and
they
wore
lost
in
the
wilderness
,
for
the
space
of
many
days
,
yl
they
were

,
and

returned
to
this
land
,
having
travelled
in
a
land
among
many
waters
;
having
discovered
a
lend
which
was
covered
with
bones
of
men
,
and
of
beasts
,
&c
.,
and
was
also
covered
wilh
ruins
of
buildings
of
every
kind
;
having
discovercd
a
land
which
had
been
peopled
with
a
people
,
which
were
as
num
rous
as
the
hosts
of
Israel
,
And
for
a
testimony
that
the
things
that
they
have
said
ig
true
,
they
have
brought
tweniyfour
plates
,
which
are
filled
with
engravings
;
and
they
are
of
pure
gold
.
And
behold
,
also
,
they
have
brought
breastplate
,
which
are
large
;
and
they
are
of
brass
,
ond
of
copper
,
and
are
perfectly
sound
.
And
again
:
They

the

and
the

thereof

and
there
is
no
one
in
the
land
that
is
able
to
interpret
the
language
or
the
engravings
that
are
on

.
Therefore

said
unto

that

And
the

at
[File:177]
called
interpreters
;
and
no
man
can
look
in
them
,
except
he
be
commanded
,
lest
he
should
look
for
that
he
had
not
ought
,
and
he
should
perish
.
And
whosoever
is
commanded
to
look
in
them
,
the
same
is
called
seer
.
And
behold
,
the
king
of
the
people
which
is
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
is
the
man
that
is
commanded
to
do
these
things
,
and
which

this
high
gift

God
.
And
the
king
saith

And
Ammon
saith
,
That

,
and
a
prophet
also
;
and
a
gift
which
is
greater
,
can
no
man
have
,
except
he
should
possess
the
power
of
God
,
which
no
man
can
;
yeta
man
may
have
great
power
given
him
from
God
.
But
a
seer
can
know
of
things
which
has
past
,
and
also
of
things
which
is
to
come
;
and
by
them
shall
ail

,
orrather
,
shall

be
made

,
and
hidden

shall
come
to
light
,
and
things
which

not
known
,
shall
be
made
known
by
them
;
and
also
,
things
shall
be
made
known
by
them
,
which
otherwise
could

Thus
God

provided
a

that

through

,
might
work
mighty
inivacles
;
therefore
,
he
becometh

And
now
,
when
Ammon
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
these
words
,
the
king
rejoiced
excecdingly
,
and
gave
thanks
to
God
,
saying
,
Doubtless
,
a
great
mystery
is
contained
within

;
and
these

of
unfolding
all

An

from

time
they
left

until

were

was
desirous
that
they
should
not
be
destroyed
;
therclore
,
J
contended
with
my
brethren
in
the
wilderness
:
for
I
would
that
our
ruler
should
make
a
treaty
with
them
.
But
he
being
an
austere
and
a
blood
-
thirsty
man
,
commanded
that
J
should
be
slain

and

against

until
the
greatest
number
of
our
army
was
destroyed
in
the
wilder
ness
;
and
we
returned
,
those
of
us
that
were
spared
,
to
the
land
of
Zarahemila
,
10
relate
that
tale
to
their
wives
,
and
their
children
.
And
yet
,
I
bemg
over
zealous
to
inherit
the
land
of
our
fathers
,
collected
as
many
as
were
desirous
to
go
up
to
possess
the
land
,
and
started
again
on
our
journcy
into
the
wit
derness
,
to
go
up
to
the
land
;
but
we
were
smitten
with
fam
ine
and
sore
afilictions
:
for
we
were
slow
to
remember
the
Lord
our
God
,
Nevertheless
,
after
many
days'
wandering
in
the
wilderness
,
we
pitched
our
tents
in
the
place
where
our
brethren
were
slain
,
which
was
near
to
the
land
of
our
fathers
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
went
again
with
four
of
my
meq
into
the
city
,
in
unto
the
king
,
that
]
might
know
of
the
dispe
sition
of
the
king
,
and
that
I
might
know
if
I
might
go
in
with
my
people
,
and
possess
the
land
in
peace
.
And
I
went
in
unto
the
king
,
and
he
covenanted
with
me
,
that
I
might
pos
sess
the
land
of
Lehi
-
Nephi
,
and
the
land
of
Shilom
.
And
he
also
commanded
that
his
people
should
depart
out
of
(
he
land
,
and
I
and
my
people
went
into
the
land
,
that
we
might
poe
sess
it
,
And
we
began
to
build
buildings
,
and
to
repair
the
wells
of
the
eity
,
yea
,
even
the
walls
of
the
city
of
Lehi
-
Nephi
,
and
the
city
of
Shilom
.
And
we
began
to
till
the
ground
,
yea
,
even
with
all
manner
of
seeds
,
with
seeds
of
corn
,
and
of
Wheat
,
and
of
barley
,
and
with
neas
,
and
with
sheum
,
and
with
seeds
of
all
manner
of
fruits
:
and
we
did
begin
to
mul
tiply
and
prosper
in
the
land
.
Now
,
it
was
the
cunning
and
the
crafimess
of
king
Laman
,
to
bring
my
people
into
bow
dage
,
tbat
he
yielded
up
the
land
,
that
we
might
possess
it
.
Therefore
,
it
came
to
pass
that
-
after
we
had
dwelt
im
the
land
for
the
space
of
twelve
years
,
that
king
Laman
began
to
stow
uneasy
,
lest
by
any
means
my
people
should
wax
strong
in
the
land
,
and
that
they
could
not
overpower
them
ami
ring
them
into
bondage
.
Now
,
they
were
a
lazy
,
and
at
[File:179]
idolatrous
people
;
therefore
,
they
were
desirous
to
bring
us
into
bondage
,
that
they
might
glut
theinselves
with
the
labors
of
our
hands
;
yea
,
that
they
might
feast
themselves
upon
the
flocks
of
our
fields
.
Therefore
,
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Laman
began
to
stir
up
his
people
,
that
they
should
contend
with
my
people
;
therefore
,
there
began
to
be
wars
and
contentions
in
the
land_
For
,
in
the
thirteenth
year
of
my
reign
in
the
land
of
Nephj
;
away
on
the
south
of
the
land
of
Shilom
,
when
my
people
were
watering
and
feeding
their
flocks
,
and
tiling
their
landy
a
numerous
host
of
Lamanites
came
upon
them
,
and
began
to
slay
them
,
and
to
take
of
their
flocks
,
and
the
corn
of
their
fields
,
Yea
,
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
fled
,
all
that
were
not
overtaken
,
even
into
the
city
of
Nephi
,
and
did
call
upor
ne
for
protection
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
arm
them
with
bows
,
and
with
arrows
,
with
swords
,
and
with
cimeters
,
and
with
clubs
and
with
slings
,
and
with
all
manner
of
weapons
which
we
could
invent
,
and
I
and
my
people
did
go
forth
against
the
La~
mamites
,
to
battle
;
yea
,
in
the
strength
of
the
Lord
did
we
go
orth
to
battle
against
the
Lamanites
:
for
land
my
people
did
ery
mightily
to
the
Lord
,
that
he
would
deliver
us
out
.
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies
,
for
we
were
awakened
to
a
re+
membrance
of
the
deliverance
of
our
fathers
.
And
God
did
hear
our
cries
,
and
did
answer
our
prayers
;
and
we
did
go
forth
in
his
might
.
Yea
,
we
did
go
forth
against
the
Lamanites
;
and
in
one
day
and
a
night
,
we
did
slay
three
thousand
ane
forty
-
three
;
we
did
slay
them
,
even
until
we
had
driven
them
cutof
our
land
.
And
I
,
myself
,
with
mine
own
hands
,
did
help
to
bury
their
dead
.
And
behold
,
to
our
great
sorrow
and
lamentation
,
two
hundred
and
seventy
-
nine
of
our
brethren
Were
slain
,
7
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
again
began
to
establish
the
kingdom
;
and
we
again
began
to
possess
the
land
in
peace
.
And
I
caused
that
there
should
be
weapons
of
war
made
,
of
every
kind
,
that
thereby
I
might
haye
weapons
for
my
people
,
against
the
time
the
Lamanites
should
come
up
aguin
to
war
against
my
people
.
And
I
set
guards
round
about
the
land
,
that
the
Lamanites
might
not
come
upon
us
again
unawares
,
and
destroy
us
;
and
thus
I
did
guard
my
.
people
,
and
my
flocks
,
and
keep
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
our
ene
-.
mies
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
inherit
the
land
of
our
fa~
4
[File:180]
thers
,
for
many
years
;
yea
,
for
the
space
of
twenty
and
tye
years
.
And
I
did
cause
that
the
men
should
till
the
groung
and
raise
all
manner
of
grain
,
and
all
manner
of
fruit
,
of
eve
kind
.
And
1
did
cause
that
the
women
should
spin
,
and
toi]
and
work
,
and
work
all
manner
of
fine
Jinen
;
yea
,
and
clot
of
every
kind
,
that
we
might
clothe
our
nakedness
;
and
thi
:
we
did
prosper
in
the
land
;
thus
we
did
have
continual
peace
jn
the
land
,
for
the
space
of
twenty
and
two
years
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Laman
died
,
and
his
son
be
gan
to
reign
in
his
stead
.
And
he
began
to
stir
his
people
wy
in
rebellion
against
my
people
;
therefore
,
they
began
to
pre
are
for
war
,
and
to
come
up
to
battle
against
my
peoples
ut
I
having
sent
my
spies
out
round
about
the
land
of
Shen
.
Jon
,
that
I
might
discover
their
preparations
,
that
!
might
guint
against
them
,
that
they
might
not
come
upon
my
people
and
desiroy
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
up
upon
the
north
d
the
lund
of
Shilom
,
with
their
numerous
hosts
,
men
armed
with
bows
,
and
with
arrows
,
and
with
swords
,
and
with
cime
ters
,
end
with
stoncs
,
end
with
slings
;
and
they
bad
ther
heads
shaved
,
that
they
were
naked
;
and
they
were
gine
about
with
a
Jeathern
girdle
about
their
Joins
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
caused
that
the
women
aud
ghildren
of
my
people
should
be
hid
in
the
wilderness
ant]
also
caused
that
all
my
old
men
that
could
bear
arms
,
and
a
so
all
my
young
men
that
were
able
to
bear
arms
,
should
gather
themselves
together
,
to
go
to
battle
against
the
Lamar
ites
;
and
did
place
them
in
their
ranks
,
every
man
accor
ding
{o
his
age
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
go
up
to
battle
against
tle
[uinanites
.
And
{
,
even
J
,
in
my
old
age
,
did
go
up
to
butlle
against
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
dd
go
up
in
the
strength
of
the
Lord
,
to
battle
.
Now
,
the
Lamanites
knew
nothing
concerning
the
Lord
,
nat
the
strength
of
the
Lord
;
therefore
,
they
depended
upon
thet
own
strength
.
Yet
they
were
a
strong
people
,
as
to
the
strength
of
men
:
they
were
a
wild
,
and
ferocious
,
and
a
blood
-
thirsy
people
,
believing
in
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
,
which
is
this
:
Belicting
that
they
were
driven
out
of
the
Jand
of
Jerusalem
,
because
of
the
iniquities
of
their
fathers
,
and
that
they
wer
wronged
in
the
wilderness
by
their
brethren
;
and
they
wer
also
wronged
,
while
crossing
the
sea
.
And
again
:
That
tht
srere
wronged
while
in
the
land
of
their
first
inheritance
,
fe
[File:181]
they
had
crosted
the
sea
;
and
all
this
,
hecause
that
Nephi
was
more
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
3
therefore
he
was
favored
of
the
Lord
,
for
the
Lord
heard
his
prayers
and
answered
them
,
and
he
took
the
lead
of
their
journey
in
the
wilderness
.
And
his
brethren
were
wroth
with
hiin
,
because
they
understood
not
the
dealings
of
the
Lord
;
they
were
also
wroth
with
him
upon
the
waters
,
because
they
hardened
their
hearts
against
the
Lord
.
And
again
:
They
were
wroth
with
him
,
when
they
had
arriven
to
the
promised
land
,
because
they
said
that
he
had
taken
the
ruling
of
the
people
out
of
their
hands
;
and
they
sought
to
kill
him
.
And
again
:
They
were
wroth
with
him
,
because
he
departed
into
the
wilderness
as
the
Lord
bad
commanded
him
,
and
took
the
records
which
were
engraven
on
the
plates
of
brass
;
for
they
said
that
he
robbed
them
.
And
thus
they
have
taught
their
children
,
that
they
should
hate
them
,
and
that
they
should
murder
them
,
and
that
they
should
rob
and
plunder
them
,
and
do
all
they
could
to
destroy
them
;
therefore
,
they
haye
an
eternal
hatred
towards
the
children
of
Nephi
.
For
this
very
eause
hath
king
Laman
,
by
his
cunning
and
Iying
craftiness
,
an
his
fair
promises
,
hath
deceived
me
,
that
I
haye
brought
this
,
my
people
,
up
into
this
land
,
that
they
may
destroy
them
;
yea
,
and
we
have
suffered
this
many
years
in
the
land
,
And
now
I
,
Zeniff
,
afler
having
told
ull
these
things
unto
my
people
concerning
the
Lamanites
,
I
did
stimulate
them
to
go
to
battle
with
their
might
,
putting
their
trust
in
the
Lord
;
therefore
,
we
did
contend
with
them
,
face
to
face
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
drive
them
again
out
of
our
land
;
and
we
slew
them
with
a
great
slaughter
,
even
so
many
that
we
did
not
number
them
.
t
Aad
it
came
to
pass
that
we
returned
again
to
our
own
Tand
,
and
my
people
again
began
to
tend
their
flocks
,
and
to
till
their
ground
.
And
now
,
I
being
old
,
did
confer
the
kingdom
upon
-
one
of
my
sons
;
therefore
,
I
suy
no
more
,
And
may
the
Lord

people

Awn
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Zeniff
conferred
the
kingdom
upon
Noali
,
one
of
his
sons
;
therefore
Noah
began
to
reign
.
i
his
stead
;
and
he
did
not
walk
in
ihe
ways
of
his
father
.
.
[File:182]
For
behold
,
he
did
not
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
by
he
did
walk
alter
the
dexires
of
his
own
heart
.
And
he
hag
aiany
wives
and
concubines
.
And
he
did
cause
his
peopleto
commit
sin
,
and
do
that
which
was
abominable
in
the
sight
of
the
Lord
.
Yea
,
and
they
did
commit
whoredonis
,
and
all
man
,
ner
of
wickedness
.
And
he
laid
a
tax
of
one
fitth
part
of
all
sthey
possessed
;
a
filth
part
of
theiy
gold
and
of
their
silver
,
and
a
fifth
part
of
their
ziff
,
and
of
their
copper
,
and
of
their
brass
and
their
iron
;
and
a
fifth
part
of
their
tatlings
;
and
a
so
,
a
filth
part
of
all
their
grain
,
And
al}
this
did
he
take
,
support
himself
,
and
his
wives
,
and
his
concubines
,
and
also
,
his
priests
,
and
their
wives
,
and
their
concubines
;
thus
he
had
ehaiged
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
.
For
he
put
down
all
the
priests
that
had
been
consecrated
by
his
father
,
and
conser
ted
new
ones
in
their
stead
,
such
as
were
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
hearts
.
Yea
,
and
thus
were
they
supported
in
ther
laziness
,
and
in
their
idolatry
,
and
in
their
whoredoms
,
by
the
faxes
which
king
Noah
had
put
upon
his
people
;
thus
did
the
people
labor
exceedingly
,
to
support
iniquity
.
Yea
,
and
thy
also
became
idolatrous
,
because
they
were
deceived
by
the
vain
and
flattering
words
of
the
king
and
priests
;
for
they
dil
speak
flattering
things
unto
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Noah
built
many
elegant
an
spacious
buildings
;
and
he
ornamented
them
with
fine
work
of
wood
,
and
of

and
of

and
of

,
and
of
ziff
,
and
of
copper
;
and
he
also
built
him
a
spacious
,
palace
,
and
a
throne
in
tle
ynidst
thereof
,
all
of
which
was
of
fine
wood

was

mented
with

,
and
with
precious
things
.
Ant
he
also
caused
that
bis
workmen
should
work
all
manner
df
fine
work
within
the
wells
of
the
temple
,
of
fine
wood
,
and
o
copper
,
and
of
brass
;
and
the
seats
which
was
set
apart
for
the
high
priests
,
which
was
above
all
the
other
seats
,
be
dit
ornament
with
pure
gold
;
and
he
caused
a
breastwork
to
be
built
before
them
,
that
they
might
rest
their
bodies
and
thew
arms
upon
,
while
they
should
speak
lying'
and
vain
words
0
his
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
built
9
tower
near
the
temple
;
yea
,
a
very
high
tower
,
even
so
high
that
he
could
stand
upon
the
top
thereof
and
overlook
the
land
of
Shilom
,
and
also
the
land
of
Shemlon
,
which
was
possessed
by
the
Lamanites
;
and
che
could
even
look
over
all
the
land
round
about
.
q
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
caused
many
buildings
to
be
[File:183]
built
in
the
land
Shilom
;
and
he
caused
a
great
tower
to
be
built
on
the
hill
north
of
the
land
Shilom
,
which
had
been
a
resort
for
the
children
of
Nephi
,
at
the
time
they
iled
out
of
the
land
;
and
thus
he
did
do
with
the
riches
which
he
obtained
by
the
taxation
of
his
people
.
And
il
came
to
pass
that
he
placed
his
heart
upon
his
riches
,
and
he
spent
his
ume
in
riotous
living
with
his
wives
and
lus
concubines
;
and
so
did
also
his
priests
spend
their
time
with
harlots
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
planted
vineyards
round
about
in
the
land
;
and
he
built
wine
presses
,
and
made
wine
in
abundance
;
and
therefore
he
became
a
wine
bibber
,
and
also
his
people
.
And
it
came
io
pass
that
the
Lamanites
began
to
come
in
upon
bis
people
,
upon
small
numbers
,
and
to
slay
them
in
their
ficld=
,
and
while
they
were
tending
their
flocks
.
And
king
Noah
sent
guards
round
about
the
land
to
keep
them
oif
;
but
he
did
not
,
send
a
suflicient
number
,
and
the
Lamaniies
came
upon
them
and
killed
them
,
and
drove
many
of
their
flocks
out
of
the
land
:
thus
the
Lamanites
began
to
destroy
them
,
and
to
exercise
their
hatred
upon
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Noah
sent
bis
armies
against
them
,
and
they
were
driven
back
,
or
they
drove
them
back
for
atime
;
therefore
,
they
returned
rejoicing
in
their
spoil
.
And
now
,
because
of
this
great
victory
,
they
were
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
hearts
;
they
did
boast
in
their
own
strength
,
saying
,
That
their
fifty
could
stand
.
against
thousands
of
the
Lamanites
;
and
thus
they
did
boast
,
and
did
delight
in
blood
,
and
the
shedding
of
the
blood
ef
their
brethren
,
and
this
be
-—
cause
of
the
wickedness
of
their
king
and
priests
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
a
man
among
them
,
whose
name
was
Abinadi
;
and
he
went
forth
among
them
,
and
began
to
prophesy
,
saying
,
Behold
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
,
and
thus
hath
he
commanded
me
,
saying
,
Go
forth
and
say
unto
this
people
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
:
Wo
be
unto
this
people
,
for
Lhave
seen
their
abominations
,
and
their
wickedness
,
and
their
whoredoms
;
and
except
they
repent
,
I
will
visit
them
in
mine
anger
.
And
except
they
repent
,
and
turn
to
the
Lord
their
God
,
behold
,
I
will
deliver
them
into
the
hands
of
their
chemies
;
yea
,
and
they
shall
he
brought
info
bondage
;
and
they
shall
be
afflicted
by
the
hand
of
their
enemics
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
they
shall
know
that
I
am
the
Lord
their
God
,
and
am
a
Jealous
God
,
visiting
the
iniquities
of
my
people
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
except
this
people
re
[File:184]
pent
,
and
turn
unto
the
Lord
their
God
,
they
shall
he
broughtin
.
to
hondage
;
and
none
shall
deliver
them
,
exceptit
be
the
Lord
the
Almighty
God
.
¥ca
,
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
they
shall
ery
unto
me
,
I
will
be
slow
to
hear
their
cries
;
yea
,
and
I
will
suiler
them
that
they
be
smitten
by
their
enemies
,
And
except
they
repent
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
,
and
ery
mightily
to
the
Lord
their
God
,
J
will
not
hear
their
prayers
,
nejther
will
I
deliver
them
out
of
their
afflictions
;
and
thus
saith
the
Lord
,
and
thus
hath
he
commanded
me
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Abinadi
had
spoken
these
words
unto
them
,
they
were
wroth
with
him
,
and
sought
to
take
away
his
life
;
but
the
Lord
delivered
him
out
of
their
hands
.
Now
when
king
Noah
had
heard
of
the
words
which
Abinadi
had
spake
unto
the
people
,
be
was
also
wroth
;
and
he
saith
,
Who
is
Abinadi
,
that
I
and
my
people
should
be
judged
of
hin
?
or
who
is
the
Lord
,
that
shall
bring
upon
my
eople
such
great
affliction
?
Tcommand
you
to
bring
Abinadi
hither
,
that
I
may
slay
bim
:
for
he
hath
said
these
things
,
thet
he
might
stir
up
my
people
to
anger
,
one
with
another
,
and
t
raise
contentions
among
my
people
;
therefore
,
[
will
slay
him
Now
the
eyes
of
the
people
were
blinded
;
therefore
,
they
hardened
their
hearts
against
the
words
of
Abinadi
,
and
they
sought
from
that
time
forward
to
take
him
.
And
king
Nowk
hardened
bis
heart
against
the
word
of
the
Lord
;
and
he
did
not
repent
of
Iris
evil
doings
.
\
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
space
of
two
years
,
thet
Abinadi
came
among
them
in
disguise
,
that
they
knew
him
ne
,
and
began
again
to
prophesy
among
them
,
saying
,
Thus
helh
the
Lord
commanded
me
,
saying
:
Abinadi
,
go
and
prophey
unto
this
my
people
,
for
they
have
hardened
their
hearts
against
my
words
;
they
have
repented
not
of
their
evil
doings
;
therefore
,
I
will
visit
them
in
my
anger
,
yea
,
in
my
fierce
a
ger
will
I
visit
them
in
their
iniquities
and
abominations
;
ye
wo
be
unto
this
generation
,
And
the
Lord
said
unto
me
,
Stretch
forth
thy
hand
,
and
propliesying
,
saying
,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
:
if
shall
come
to
pass
that
this
generation
,
hecall®
of
their
iniquities
,
shall
be
brought
into
bondage
,
and
shall
he
smitten
on
the
vheek
;
yea
,
and
shall
be
driven
by
men
,
and
shall
be
slain
;
and
the
vultures
i
the
air
,
and
the
dogs
,
yea
and
the
wild
beasts
,
shall
devour
their
flesh
.
And
it
shall
comie
to
pass
that
the
life
of
king
Noah
shal
be
yalued
even
asa
garment
ina
hot
furnace
;
for
he
shill
kwow
that
Jam
the
Lord
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
J
[File:185]
will
smite
this
my
people
,
with
sore
afllictions
;
yea
,
with
famjne
and
with
pestilence
;
and
TF
will
cause
that
they
shall
howl
all
the
day
tong
.
Yea
,
and
I
will
cause
that
they
shall
have
purdens
lashed
upon
their
backs
;
and
ihey
shall
be
driven
before
,
Hike
a
dumb
ass
.
Audit
shall
come
to
pass
that
J
will
send
forth
hail
among
them
,
and
it
shall
smite
them
;
and
they
shall
also
be
smitten
with
the
east
wind
;
and
insects
shall
pester
their
land
also
,
and
devour
thejr
grain
.
And
they
shall
be
smitten
with
@
great
pestilence
;
and
all
this
will
J
do
,
because
of
their
iniquities
and
abominations
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
except
they
repent
,
1
will
utterly
destroy
them
.
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
;
yet
they
shall
leave
a
record
behind
them
,
and
I
will
preserve
them
for
other
nations
which
shall
possess
the
land
;
yea
,
even
this
will
I
do
,
that
I
may
discover
the
abominations
of
this
people
to
other
nations
.
And
many
things
did
Abinadi
prophesy
against
this
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
angry
with
him
;
and
they
took
him
and
carried
him
bound
before
the
king
,
and
saith
unto
the
king
,
Behold
,
we
lave
brought
a
man
before
thee
which
has
prophesied
evil
concerning
thy
people
,
and
saith
that
God
will
destroy
them
;
and
he
also
prophesieth
evil
concerning
thy
life
,
and
saith
that
thy
life
shall
be
as
a
garment
in
a
furnace
of
fire
,
And
again
:
Ile
saith
that
thou
shalt
be
asa
stalk
,
even
as
a
dry
stalk
of
the
field
,
which
is
ran
over
by
the
beasts
and
trodden
under
foot
.
And
again
:
Te
saith
thou
shalt
be
as
the
blossoms
of
a
thistle
,
which
when
it
is
fully
ripe
,
if
the
wind
bloweth
,
itis
driven
forth
upon
the
face
of
-
the
land
;
and
he
pretendeth
the
Lord
hath
spoken
it
.
And
he
saith
all
this
shall
come
upon
thee
,
except
thou
repent
;
and
this
because
of
thine
iniquitics
.
{
And
now
,
O
king
,
what
great
evil
hast
thou
done
,
or
what
great
sins
has
thy
people
committed
,
that
we
should
be
condemned
of
God
,
or
judged
of
this
man
?
And
now
,
O
king
,
behold
,
we
are
guiltless
,
and
thou
,
O
king
,
hast
not
sinned
;
therefore
,
this
man
hast
lied
concerning
you
,
and
he
hath
prophesied
in
vain
,
And
behold
,
we
are
strong
,
we
shall
not
come
into
bondage
,
or
be
taken
captive
by
our
enemies
;
yea
,
and
thou
hast
prospered
in
the
land
,
and
thou
shalt
also
prosper
.
Behold
,
here
is
the
man
,
we
deliver
him
into
thy
hands
;
ihou
mayest
do'with
him
as
seemeth
thee
good
.
=
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Noah
caused
that
Abinadi
[File:186]
should
be
east
into
prison
;
and
he
commanded
that
the
presi
should
gather
themselves
together
,
that
he
might
hold
a
council
with
them
what
he
should
do
with
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
saith
unto
the
king
,
Bring
him
hither
,
that
we
may
question
him
.
And
the
kine
commanded
that
he
should
-
be
brought
before
them
.
And
they
began
to
question
him
,
that
they
might
cross
him
,
that
thereby
they
might
have
wherewith
to
acvuse
him
;
but
he
answered
them
boldly
,
and
with
.
stood
all
their
questions
,
yea
,
to
their
astonishnient
:
for
he
did
withstand'
them
in
all
their
questions
,
and
did
confoun
them
in
all
their
words
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
one
of
them
saith
unto
bim
,-
What
meancth
the
words
which
are
written
,
and
which
have
been
taught
by
our
fathers
,
saying
:
How
beautiful
upon
the
moun
.
tains
are
the
feet
of
Him
that
bringeth
good
tidings
;
that
pab
lisheth
peace
;
that
bringeth
good
tidings
of
good
;
that
pub
.
lisheth
salvation
;
that
sayeth
unto
Zion
,
Thy
God
reigneth
;
thy
watthmen
shall
lift
up
the
voice
with
the
voice
;
together
shail
they
sing
,
for
they
shall
see
eye
to
eye
,
when
the
Lord
shall
bring
again
Zion
.
Break
forth
into
Joy
+
sing
together
ve
waste
places
of
Jerusalem
:
for
the
Lord
hath
comforted
his
people
;
he
hath
redeemed
Jerusalem
.
The
Lord
hath
made
bare
bis
holy
arm
in
the
eyes
-
of
all
the
nations
;
and
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
shall
see
the
salvation
of
our
God
.
And
now
Abinadi
saith
unto
them
,
Are
you
priests
,
and
pretend
to
teach
this
people
,
and
to
understand
the
spirit
of
prophesying
,
and
yet
desireth
to
know
of
me
what
these
things
mean
?
Tsay
unto
,
Wo
be
unto
you
for
perverting
the
ways
of
the
Tord
.
For
if
.
ye
understand
these
things
,
ye
have
not
taught
them
;
therefore
,
ye
have
perverted
the
ways
of
the
Lord
—
Ye
have
not
apphed
your
hearts
to
understanding
;
therefore
,
ye
have
not
been
wise
.
Therefore
,
what
teachest
thou
this
people
?
And
they
said
,
We
teach
the
law
of
Moses
.
And
again
:
He
saith
unto
them
,
If
ye
teach
the
law
of
Moses
,
why
do
ye
not
keep
it
?
Why
do
ye
set
your
hearts
upon
riches
?
Why
do
ye
commit
whoredoms
,
and
.
spend
your
strength
with
harlots
,
yea
,
and
cause
this
people
to
commit
sin
,
that
the
Lord
hath
cause
to
send
me
to
prophesy
against
this
people
,
yea
,
Cven
a
great
evil
against
this
people
?
Knowest
thou
not
that
Tspeak
the
truth
?
Yea
,
thou
knowest
that
I
speak
the
truth
;
and
you
ha
ought
fo
tremble
before
God
.
And
it
shall
come
to
puss
that
ve
shall
be
smitten
for
thine
miquities
:
for
ye
have
suid
that
ye
teach
the
law
of
Moses
.
[File:187]
And
what
knowest
thou
conecrning
the
law
of
Moses
?
Doth
salvation
come
by
the
law
of
Moses
?
What
sayest
thou
?
And
they
answered
and
said
,
that
salvation
did
come
by
the
law
of
Moses
.
But
now
Abinadi
saith
unto
them
,
I
know
if
ye
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
ye
shall
be
saved
;
yea
,
if
ye
keep
the
commandments
which
the
Lord
delivered
unto
Moses
in
the
mount
of
Sinai
,
saying
:
1am
the
Lord
thy
God
,
which
have
brought
thee
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
,
out
of
the
house
of
bondage
.
Thou
shalt
have
no
other
God
before
me
.
Thon
shalt
not
make
unto
thee
any
graven
image
,
or
any
likeness
of
any
thing
in
the
heaven
above
,
or
things
which
is
im
the
earth
beneath
.
Now
Abinadi
saith
unto
them
,
Have
ye
done
ail
this
?
Isay
unto
you
,
Nay
,
ye
have
uot
.
And
have
ye
taught
this
people
that
they
should
do
all
these
things
?
Isay
unto
you
,
Nay
,
ye
have
not
.
And
now
when
the
king
had
heard
these
words
,
he
said
unto
his
priests
,
Away
with
this
fellow
,
and
slay
him
:
for
what
have
we
to
do
with
him
,
for
he
is
mad
.
And
they
stood
forth
aad
attempted
to
lay
their
hands
on
him
;
but
he
withstood
them
,
and
said
unto
them
,
Touch
me
not
,
for
God
shall
smite
you
if
ye
lay
your
hands
upon
me
,
for
I
have
not
delivered
the
message
which
the
Lord
sent
me
to
deliver
;
neither
have
Jtold
you
that
which
ye
requested
that
I
should
tell

therefore
,
God
will
not
suffer
that
[
shall
be
destroyed
at
this

But
must
fulfil
the
commandments
wherewith
God
hath
commanded
me
;
and
because
I
have
told
you
the
trath
,
ye
are
angry
with
me
.
And
again
:
Because
Ihave
spoken
the
word
of
God
,
ye
have
judged
me
that
Tam
mad
,
Now
it
came
to
pass
after
Abinadi
had
spoken
these
words
,
that
the
people
of
king
Noah
durst
not
lay
their
hands
on
him
;
for
the
Spirit
of
the
Lord
-
was
upon
him
;
and
his
face
shone
with
exceeding
lustre
,
even
as
Moses
did
while
in
the
mount
of
Sinai
,
while
speaking
with
the
Lord
.
And
he
spake
with
power
and
authority
from
God
;
and
he
continued
his
words
,
saying
,
Ye
see
that
ye
have
not
power
to
slay
me
,
therefore
T
finish
my
message
.
Yea
,
and
J
perecive
that
it
cuts
you
to
your
hearts
,
because
I
tell
you
the
truth
concerning
your
iniquities
;
yea
,
and
my
words
fill
you
with
wonder
and
amazement
,
and
with
anger
.
But

finish
my
message
;
and
then
it

not
whither
I
go

if
it
so

this

I

And
now

unto

that

AAnbit
came
to
pass
that
after
Abinadi
had
made
an
endd
these
sayings
,
that
he
said
unto
them
,
Haye
ye
taught
this
people
that
they
should
observe
to
do
all
these
things
?
For
to
keep
these
commandments
?
say
.
unto
you
,
Nay
;
for
i
ye
had
,
the
Lord
would
not
have
caused
me
to
come
jowth
ani
to
prophesy
evil
concerning
this
people
.
And
now
ye
hare
said
that
salvation
cometh
by
the
law
of
Moses
.
say
unto
you
that
it
is
expedient
that
ye
should
keep
the
Jaw
of
Moses
as
yet
;
bat
I
say
unto
Fou
,
that
the
time
shall
come
when
it
[File:189]
shall
no
more
be
expedient
to
keep
the
law
of
Moses
.
And
morcoyer
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
salvation
doth
not
come
by
the
law
alone
;
and
were
it
not
for
the
atonement
.
which
God
himself
shall
make
for
the
sins
and
iniquities
of
his
people
,
that
they
must
unavoidably
perish
,
notwithstanding
the
law
of
Moses
,
And
now
I
say
unto
you
,
that
it
was
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
law
given
to
the
children
of
Isracl
,
yea
,
even
a
very
strict
law
:
for
they
were
a
stiffnecked
people
,
quick
to
do
iniquity
,
and
slow
to
remember
the
Lord
their
God
;
therefore
there
was
a
law
given
them
,
yea
,
a
law
of
performances
and
of
ordinances
,
a
law
which
they
were
to
observe
strictly
,
from
day
to
day
,
to
keep
them
in
remembrance
of
God
,
und
their
duty
towards
him
.
But
behold
,
1
say
unto
you
,
that
all
these
things
were
types
of
things
to
come
.
And
now
,
did
they
understand
the
law
?
I
say
unto
you
,
Nay
,
they
did
not
all
understand
the
law
;
and
this
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
:
for
they
understood
not
that
there
could
not
any
man
be
saved
,
except
it
were
through
the
redemption
of
God
.
Wor
hehold
,
did
not
Moses
prophesy
unto
them
concerning
the
coming
of
the
Messiah
,
and
that
God
should
redeem
his
people
,
yea
,
and
even
all
the
prophets
which
have
prophesicd
ever
since
the
world
began
?
Have
they
not
spoken
more
or
less
concerning
these
things
?
Have
they
not
said
that
God
himself
should
come
down
among
the
children
of
men
,
and
take
upon
him
the
form
of
man
,
and
go
forth
in
mighty
power
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
?
Yoa
,
and
have
they
not
said
also
,
that
he
should
bring
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
,
and
that
he
,
himself
,
should
be
oppressed
and
afflicted
?
Yea
,
even
doth
not
Isaiah
say
,
Who
hath
believed
our
report
,
-
and
to
whom
is
the
arm
of
the
Lord
revealed
?
for
he
shall
grow
up
hefore
him
as
a
tender
plant
,
and
as
a
root
out
of
dry
ground
:
he
hath
no
form
nor
comeliness
;
and
when
we
shall
sce
lim
,
there
is
no
beauty
that
we
should
desire
him
.
He
is
despised
and
rejected
of
men
;
a
man
of
sorrows
,
and
acquainted
with
grief
:
cind
we
hid
as
it
were
our
faces
from
him
3
he
was
des
pised
,
and
we
esteemed
him
not
,
Surely
he
hath
borne
our
griefs
,
and
carried
our
sorrows
:
yel
we
did
esteem
him
stricken
,
smitten
of
God
,
and
ae
:
But
he
was
wounded
for
our
transgressions
,
he
was
ed
.
for
our
iniquities
;
the
chastisement
of
our
peace
was
upon
hin
;
and
with
his
stripes
we
arehealed
.
All
we
,
like
sheep
,
have
gone
astray
;
we
have
turned
every
one
to
his
own
way
;
and
the
Lord
hath
laid
on
him
the
imiquities
of
us
ull
.
He
[File:190]
was
oppressed
,
and
he
was
afflicted
,
yet
he
opened
not
hig
mouth
:
heis
brought
asa
lamb
to
the
laughter
,
and
as
a
she
:
before
her
shearers
is
dumb
,
so
he
opened
not
his
mouth
.
He
was
taken
from
prison
and
from
judgment
:
and
who
shall
dg
.
clare
his
generation
?
for
he
wax
cut
off
out
of
the
land
of
the
living
:
for
the
transgressions
of
my
people
was
he
stricke
,
And
he
made
his
grave
with
the
wicked
,
and
with
the
rich
ip
his
death
;
because
he
had
done
no
evil
,
neither
was
any
de
ceit
in
his
mouth
.
.
Yet
it
pleased
the
Lord
to
bruise
him
;
he
hath
put
him
jp
grief
:
when
thou
shalt
make
bis
soul
an
offering
for
sin
,
he}
shall
see
his
seed
,
he
shall
prolong
his
days
,
and
the
pleasup
of
the
Lord
shall
prosper
in
his
hand
.
He
shall
see
of
te
travail
of
his
soul
,
and
shall
be
satisfied
:
by
his
knowlelg
shall
my
righteous
servant
justify
many
;
for
he
shall
ber
their
iniquitics
.
Therefore
will
1
divide
him
a
portion
wit
the
great
,
and
be
shall
divide
the
spoil
with
the
strong
;
by
cause
he
hath
poured
out
his
soul
unto
death
:
and
he
wa
numbered
with
the
transgressors
;
and
he
bare
the
sins
of
me
ny
,
and
made
intercession
for
the
transgressors
.
And
now
Abinadi
saith
unto
them
,
would
that
ye
should
understand
that
God
himself
shal}
come
down
among
the
elit
dren
of
men
,
and
shall
redeem
his
people
;
and
because
le
dwelleth
in
flesh
,
he
shall
be
called'
the
Son
of
God
:
ant
having
subjected
the
flesh
to
the
will
of
the
Father
,
being
the
Father
and
the
Son
;
the
Father
,
because
he
was
conceited
by
the
power
of
God
;
and
the
Son
,
because
of
the
flesh
thas
becoming
the
Father
and
Son
:
and
they
are
one
Gol
,
yea
,
the
very
Eternal
Father
of
Heaven
and
of

;
aul
thus
the

becoming

or
the
Soa
the
Father
,
being
one
God
,
suffereth

and
yieldeh
not

but
suffereth
himself
to

,
ant
scourged
,
and
cast

,
and

by
his
people
,
Ant
atter
wll
this
,
and
after
working
many
mighity
miracles
among
the
children
of
men
,
he
shall
be

,
yea
,
even
as
Isaich
sail
,
As
a
sheep
before

,
so
he
opened
not
his

yea
,
even
so
he
shall
be
led
,
crucified
,
and
slain
,
the
flesh
becoming
subject
even
unto
death
,
the
will
of
the

being
swallowed
up
in
the
will
of
the
Father
;
and
thus
God
breaketh
the
bands
of

;
having
gained
the
victory
over

;
giving
the

power
to
make

And
now

unto

Who

unto

,
that

for

,
ie
ther
can

Lord
redeem

:
for
he
cannot
deny

!
for
he
cannot
deny
justice
when
it
hath
its

And
now
I
say
unto
you
,
that
the
time
shall
come
thath
salvation
of
the
Lord
shall
be
declared
to

,

and

Yea

with

voice

shall
they

for

when
the
Lord
shall

Zi
Break
forth
into
joy
,
sing
together
,
ye
waste

of

:
for
the

The
Lord

eyes
of
all
the
nations
:
and
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
shale
the
salyation
of
our
God
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Abinadi
had
spoken
the
words
,
he
stretched
forth
bis
hand
and
said
,
The
time
come
when
all
shall
see
the
salvation
of
the
Lord
;
wh
every
nation
,
kindred
,
tongue

shall

shall
confess
before
God
that
his
judgments
are
just
;
then
shall
the
wicked
be
cast
out
,
and
they
shall
have
cause
howl
,
and
weep
,
and
wail
,
and
gnach
their
teeth
;
and
this}
cause
they
would
not
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
Lom
therefore
the
Lord
redeemeth
them
not
,
for
they
are
aud
deylish
,
and
the
devil
hath
power
over
them
;
yea
,
@
that
old
serpent
that
did
beguile
our
first
parents
,
which
[File:193]
the
cause
of
their
fall
;
which
was
the
cause
of
all
mankind
becoming
carnal
,
sensual
,
devlish
,
knowing
evil
from
yood
,
subjecting
themselves
to
the
devil
,
Thus
all
mankind
were
lost
;
and
behold
,
they
would
have
been
endlessly
lost
,
were
it
not
that
God
redeemed
his
people
from
their
lost
and
fallen
state
.
But
remember
,
that
he
that
persists
in
his
own
carnal
nature
,
and
goes
on
in
the
ways
of
sin
and
rebellion
against
God
,
he
remaineth
in
his
fallen
state
,
and
the
devil
hath
alt
power
over
him
.
Therefore
he
is
as
though
there
was
no
redemption
made
;
being
an
cnemy
to
God
;
and
also
is
the
devil
anenemy
to
God
.
And
now
if
Christ
had
not
come
into
the
world
,
speaking
of
things
to
come
,
as
though
they
had
already
ome
,
there
could
haye
been
no
redemption
,
And
if
Christ
had
not
risen
from
the
dead
,
or
have
broken
the
bands
of
death
,
that
the
grave
should
have
no
victory
,
and
that
death
should
have
no
sting
,
there
could
have
been
no
resurrection
.
But
there
is
a
resurrection
,
therefore
the
grave
hath
uo
victory
,
and
the
sting
of
death
is
swallowed
up
in
Christ
:
He
is
the
light
and
the
life
of
the
world
;
yea
,
a
light
that
is
endless
,
that
can
never
be
darkened
;
yea
,
and
also
a
life
which
is
endess
,
that
there
can
be
no
more
death
,
Even
this
mortal
shall
pul
on
immortality
,
and
this
corruption
shall
put
on
ineorruptioa
,
and
shall
be
brought
to
staud
before
the
bar
of
God
,
to
be
judged
of
him
according
to
their
works
,
whether
they
be
good
or
whether
they
be
evil
.
If
they
be
good
,
to
the
resurrection
of
endless
life
and
happiness
,
and
if
they
be
evil
,
to
the
resurrection
of
endless
damnation
;
being
delivered
up
to
the
devil
,
who
hath
subjected
them
,
which
is
damnation
;
having
gone
according
to
their
own
carnal
wills
and
desires
;
having
never
called
upon
the
Lord
while
the
arms
of
merey
Was
extended
towards
them
;
for
the
arms
of
merey
was
extended
towards
them
,
and
they
would
not
;
they
being
warted
of
their
iniquities
,
and
yet
they
would
not
depart
from
them
;
and
they
were
commanded
to
repent
,
and
yet
they
Would
not
repent
,
And
now
had
ye
not
ought
to
tremble
and
repent
of
your
sins
,
and
remember
only
iv
and
through
Christ
ye
can
be
saved
?
Therefore
,
if
ye
teach
the
law
of
Moses
,
also
teach
that
it
is
a
shadow
of
those
things
which
are
to
come
;
teach
them
that
redemption
cometh
through
Christ
the
Lord
,
which
is
the
very
Eternal
Father
.
Amen

CHAPTER
IX
.
Anp
how
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Abinadi
had
finish
these
sayings
,
that
the
king
commanded
that
the
pricsts
shoul
take
him
and
cause
that
he
should
be
put
to
death
,
But
thes
Was
one
among
them
,
whose
name
was
Alma
,
he
also
beings
descendant
of
Nephi
.
And
be
was
a
young
man
,
and
he
be
heved
the
words
which
Abinadi
had
spoken
,
for
he
knew
eq
),
cerning
the
iniquity
which
Abinadi
had
testified
against
them
:
Therefore
he
began
to
plead
with
the
king
that
he
would
ng
be
angry
with
Abinadi
,
but
suffer
that
he
might
depan
peace
.
But
the
king
was
more
wroth
,
and
caused
that
Aloy
should
be
cast
out
from
among
them
,
and
sent
his
servany
afier
him
,
that
they
might
slay
him
.
But
he
fled
from
Lefop
them
,
and
hid
himself
,
that
they
found
him
not
.
And
he
,
beitg
convealed
for
many
days
,
did
write
all
the
words
which
Abin
adi
had
spoken
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
caused
that
his
guar
should
surround
Abinadi
,
and
take
him
;
and
they
bound
bie
and
cast
him
into
prison
.
And
after
three
days
,
having
cou
selled
with
his
priests
,
he
caused
that
he
should
again
te
brought
before
him
.
And
he
said
unto
him
,
Abinadi
,
we
har
found
an
accusation
against
thee
,
and
thou
art
worthy
d
death
.
For
thou
hast
said
that
God
himself
should
com
down
among
the
children
of
men
;
and
now
for
this
cae
thou
shalt
be
put
to
death
,
unless
thou
wilt
recall
ali
the
words
which
thou
hast
spoken
evil
concerning
me
and
a
people
,
Now
Abinadi
saith
unto
him
:
I
say
unto
you
,
J
will
wm
recall
the
words
which
I
have
spoken
unto
you
concerning
this
people
,
for
they
are
true
;
and
that
ye
may
know
of
ther
surety
,
I
have
suffered
myself
that
I
haye
fallen
into
your
hands
,
Yea
,
and
J
will
suffer
even
until
death
,
and
J
will
nol
recall
my
words
,
and
they
shall
stand
as
a
testimony
against
you
.
And
if
ye
slay
me
,
ye
will
shed
innocent
blood
,
and
ths
shall
also
stand
as
a
testimony
against
you
at
the
last
day
.
And
now
king
Noah
was
about
to
release
him
,
for
he
feared
his
word
;
for
he
feared
that
the
judgments
of
God
would
come
upon
him
.
But
the
priests
lifted
up
their
voices
against
him
,
and
began
to
accuse
him
,
saying
:
He
hath
reviled
the
king
.
Therefore
the
king
-
was
stirred
up
in
anger
against
him
,
and
he
delivered
him
up
,
that
he
might
be
slain
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
him
,
and
bound
him
,
and
[File:195]
scourged
his
skin
with
faggots
,
yea
,
even
unto
death
,
And
pow
when
the
flames
began
to
svorch
him
,
he
cried
unto
them
saying
:
Behold
,
even
us
ye
have
doue
unto
me
,
so
shail
it
come
to
pass
that
thy
seed
shall
cause
that
many
shall
suiler
the
pains
that
J
do
suffer
,
even
the
pains
of
death
,
by
fre
;
and
this
because
they
believe
in
the
salvation
of
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
it
will
come
to
pass
that
ye
shall
be
afilicted
with
all
manner
of
diseases
,
because
of
your
iniquities
.
Yea
,
and
ye
shall
be
smitten
on
every
hand
,
and
shall
be
driven
and
scattered
to
and
fro
,
even
as
a
wild
flock
is
driven
by
wild
and
ferocious
beasts
.
And
in
thal
day
ye
shall
be
hunted
,
and
ye
shall
be
taken
by
the
hand
of
your
enemies
,
and
then
ye
shall
silfer
,
as
I
suffer
,
the
pains
of
death
,
by
fire
.
Tdjus
God
executeth
vengeance
upon
those
that
destroy
his
people
.
O
God
,
receive
my
soul
.
And
now
when
Abinadi
had
said
these
words
,
he
fell
,
having
suffered
death
by
fire
;
yea
,
having
been
put
to
death
because
he
would
not
deny
the
commandments
of
God
;
having
sealed
the
truth
of
his
words
by
his
death
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
,
who
had
fled
from
the
servants
of
king
Noah
,
repented
of
his
sins
and
iniquities
,
and
went
about
privately
among
the
people
,
and
began
to
teach
the
words
of
Abinadi
;
yea
,
concerning
that
which
was
to
come
,
and
also
concerning
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
,
and
the
redemption
of
the
people
,
which
was
to
be
brought
to
pass
through
the
power
,
and
sufferings
,
and
death
of
Christ
,
and
his
resurrection
and
ascension
into
[Icaven
,
And
as
maayas
would
hear
his
word
he
did
teach
,
And
he
taught
them
Bivately
,
that
it
might
not
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
king
,
Andmany
did
believe
his
words
,
And
it
came
to
pass
.
that
asmany
as
did
believe
him
,
did
go
forth
to
a
place
which
was
called
Mormon
,
having
received
its
name
from
the
king
,
being
inthe
borders
of
the
land
having
been
infested
,
by
times
,
or
,
at
seasons
,
by
wild
beasts
,
Now
there
was
in
Mormon
a
fountain
of
pure
water
,
and
Alma
resorted
thither
,
there
being
tar
the
water
a
thicket
of
small
trees
,
where
he
did
hide
biaself
in
the
day
-
time
,
from
the
searches
of
the
king
.
And
.
Lcame
to
pass
that
as
many
as
believed
him
,
went
thither
to
learhis
words
.
And
it
came
to
pass
after
many
days
,
there
.
Were
a
goodly
number
gathered
together
to
the
place
of
Morhon
,
to
hear
the
words
of
Alma
.
Yea
,
all
were
gathered
together
that
believed
on
his
word
,
to
hear
him
.
And
he
did
:
cach
them
,
and
did
preach
unto
them
repentance
,
and
redemption
,
and
faith
on
the
Lord
.
[File:196]
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
them
,
Behold
,
hore
is
the
waters
of
Mormon
;
for
thus
were
they
called
.
Aug
how
,
as
ye
are
desirous
to
come
into
the
fold
of
God
,
and
jp
be
called
his
people
,
and
are
willing
to
bear
one
another's
bun
dens
,
ihat
they
may
be
light
;
yea
,
and
are
willing
to
Tout
with
those
that
mourn
;
yea
,
and
comfort
those
that
standin
need
of
comfort
,
and
to
stand
as
witnesses
of
God
at
all
tin
and
in
all
things
,
and
in
all
places
that
ye
may
be
in
,
even
yp
,
iil
death
,
that
ye
may
be
redeemed
of
God
,
and
be
numberel
with
those
of
the
first
resurrection
,
that
ye
may
have
eterni]
life
:
Now
I
say
unto
you
,
if
this
be
the
desires
of
your
hea}
what
have
you
against
being
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
Lord
,
as
a
witness
before
him
that
ye
have
entered
into
a
covengy
with
him
that
ye
will
serve
him
and
keep
his
commandments
that
he
may
pour
out
his
spirit
more
abuiida
:
t'y
upon
yous
And
now
when
the
people
had
heard
these
words
,
they
clap
ped
their
hands
for
joy
,
and
exclaimed
,
This
is
the
desires
q
our
hearts
.
/
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
took
Helam
,
he
Deny
one
of
the
first
,
and
went
and
stood
forth
in
the
water
,
ai
ened
,
saying
,
O
Lord
,
pour
out
thy
spirit
upon
thy
se
that
he
may
do
this
work
with
holiness
of
heart
.
And
whe
he
had
said
these
words
,
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
was
upon
hig
and
he
said
,
Helam
,
I
baptize
thee
,
having
authority
fa
the
Almighty
God
,
as
a
festimony
that
ye
have
entered
into
:
covenant
to
serve
him
unlil
you
are
dead
,
as
to
the
mori
body
;
and
may
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
be
poured
out
upet
you
;
and
may
he
grant
unto
you
eternal
life
.
through
there
demption
of
Christ
,
which
he
hath
prepared
from
the
fount
tion
of
the
world
.
And
after
Alma
had
said
these
words
,
boll
Alma
and
Uelam
was
buried
in
the
water
;
and
they
arose
and
came
forth
out
of
the
water
rejoicing
,
being
filled
with
th
spt
.
And
again
,
Alma
took
another
,
and
went
forth
ase
cond
time
into
the
water
,
and
baptized
him
according
to
the
first
,
only
he
did
not
bury
himself
again
in
the
water
,
Ad
after
this
manier
he
did
baptize
every
one
that
went
forth
the
place
of
Mormon
;
and
they
were
in
number
abont
to
hundred
and
four
souls
;
yea
,
and
they
were
baptized
in
the
waters
of
Mormon
,
and
were
filled
with
the
grace
of
God
:
anl
they
were
called
the
Church
of
God
,
or
the
Church
of
Chris
from
that
time
forward
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
was
bapiized
by
ft
power
and
authority
of
God
,
they
was
added
to
his
church
[File:197]
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
,
having
authority
from
God
,
erduined
priests
;
cven
oue
priest
to
every
fifty
of
their
number
.
did
he
ordain
to
preach
unto
them
,
and
to
teach
them
concerning
the
things
pertaining
to
the
kingdom
of
God
.
And
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
teach
nothing
save
it
were
the
things
which
he
had
taught
,
and
which
had
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
the
holy
prophets
.
Yea
,
evcn
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
preach
nothing
save
it
were
repentance
and
faith
on
the
Lord
,
who
hath
redeemed
his
people
.
And
he
commanded
them
that
there
shouJd
be
no
contention
one
.
with
another
,
but
that
they
should
look
forward
with
one
eye
,
haying
one
faith
and
one
baptism
;
having
their
hearis
knit
together
in
unity
and
in
Joye
,
one
towards
another
.
And
thus
he
commanded
them
to
preach
.
And
thus
they
became
the
children
of
God
,
And
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
observe
the
sabbath
day
,
and
keep
it
holy
,
and
also
every
day
they
should
give
thanks
to
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
he
also
commanded
them
that
.
the
priests
which
he
had
ordained
should
labor
with
their
own
hands
for
their
support
;
and
there
was
one
day
in
every
week
that
was
sect
apart
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
to
teach
the
people
,
and
to
worship
the
Lord
their
God
,
and
also
as
often
as
it
was
in
their
power
to
assemble
themselves
together
.
And
the
priests
was
not
to
(
depend
upon
the
people
for
their
support
;
but
for
their
labor
they
were
to
receive
the
grace
of
God
,
that
they
might
wax
strong
in
the
spirit
,
having
the
knowledge
of
God
,
that
they
might
teach
with
power
and
authority
from
God
.
And'
agaia
,
Alma
commanded
that
the
people
of
the
Church
should
impart
of
their
substance
,
every

one
according
to
that
which
he
hath
;
if
he
have
more
abundantly
,
he
should
impart
more

abundantly
;
—
and
he
that
hath
but
litle
,
but
little
should
be
required
;
and~
to
him
that
hath
not
should
be
given
.
And
thus
they
shoul
impart
of
their
substance
,
of
their
own
free
will
and
good
desires

God
,
and
to
those
priests
that
stood
in
need
,
yea
,
and
to
every
needy
,
naked
soul
,
And
this
he
said
unto
them
,
having
heen
commanded
of
God
;
and
they
did
walk
uprightly
before
God
,
imparting
to
one
another
,
both
temporally
and
spiritually
,
according
to
their
needs
and
their
wants
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
all
this
was
done
iu
Mormon
;
yea
,
by
the
waters
of
Mormon
,
in
the
forest
that
was
near
the
waters
of
Mormon
;
yea
,
the
place
of

waters
of
Momon
,

forest
of

,
how
beautiful
are
they
to
the
eyes
of
them
who
there

deemer
;
yea
,
and
how
blessed
are
they
,
for
they
shall
sing
ty
his
praise
forever
.
And
these
things
were
done
in
the
bordigs
of
the
land
,
that
they
might
not
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
ding
.
But
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
,
having
dis
covered
a
movement
among
the
people
,
sent
his
servants
tg
watch
them
.
Therefore
on
the
day
that
they
were
assem
.
pling
themselves
together
to
hear
the
word
of
the
Lord
,
they
were
discovered
unto
the
king
.
And
now
the
king
saith
that
Alma'
wag
stirring
up
the
people
to
a
rebellion
against
him
;
therefore
he
sent
his
army
to
destroy
them
.
And
it
came
pass
that
Alma
,
and
the
people
of
the
Jord
were
apprised
of
the
coming
of
the
king's
army
;
therefore
they
took
their
tents
and
their
families
,
and
departed
into
the
wilderness
,
And
they
were
in
number
about
four
hundred
and
filty
souls
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
army
of
the
king
returned
,
lar
ing
seurched
in
vain
for
the
people
of
the
Lord
.
And
now
be
held
,
the
forces
of
the
king
were
small
,
having
been
reduced
,
and
there
began
to
be
a
division
among
the
remainder
of
the
people
.
And
the
lesser
part
began
to
breathe
out
threatnings
against
the
king
,
and
there
began
to
be
a
great
contenton
among
them
.
Aud
now
there
was
a
man
among
them
whos
name
was
Gideon
,
and
he
being
a
strong
man
,
and
an
enemy
to
the
king
,
therefore
he
drew
his
sword
ind
swore
in
hig
wrath
,
that
he
would
slay
the
king
.
And
it
came
to
pass
tha
he
fought
with
the
king
;
end
when
the
king
saw
that
he
was
about
to
overpower
bim
,
he
fled
and
ran
and
got
upon
the
tower
,
which
was
near
the
temple
,
And
Gideon
pursued
afte
dhim
and
was
about
to
get
upon
the
tower
to
slay
the
king
,
and
the
king
cast
his
eyes
round
about
towards
fhe
land
of
Shem
lon
,
and
behold
,
the
army
of
the
Lamynites
:
were
within
the
orders
of
the
land
.
And
now
the
king
cried
out
in
the
om
guish
of
his
soul
,
saying
,
Gideon
,
spare
me
,
Tor
the
Lamanites
are
upon
us
,
and
they
will
destroy
them
;
yea
,
they
will
de
stroy
my
people
.
And
now
the
king
was
not
so
much
com
cerned
about
his
people
,
a8
he
was
about
bis
own
life
;
never
theless
,
Gideon
did
spare
his
life
.
And
ihe
king
conumanded
the
people
that
they
should
flee
before
the
Lamanites
,
and
he
himself
did
go
before
them
,
and
they
did
flee
into
the
wilder
ness
with
(
heir
women
and
their
children
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
pursue
them
,
and
did
overtake
them
,
and
began
to
slay
them
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
commanded
them
that
li
the
men
should
leave
their
wives
and
their
children
,
and
[File:199]
ce
before
the
Lamanites
.
Now
there
were
many
that
would
not
leave
them
,
but
had
rather
stay
and
perish
with
them
.
And
the
rest
left
their
wives
and
their
children
and
fled
.
And
it
came
io
pass
that
those
that
tarricd
with
their
wives
and
their
children
,
caused
that
their
fair
daughters
should
stand
forth
and
plead
with
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
would
not
slay
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamaniies
had
compas
sion
.
on
them
,
for
they
were
charmed
with
the
beanty
of
their
women
;
therefore
the
Lamanites
did
spare
their
lives
,
&nd
took
them
captives
,
and
carried
them
back
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
and
granted
unto
thei
that
they
might
possess
the

nd
,
under
ihe
conditions
that
they
would
deliver
up
the
king
Noah
into
the
hands
of
the
Lamunites
,
and
deliver
up
their
property
,
even
one
half
of
all
they
possessed
;
one
half
of
their
gold
,
and
their
silver
,
and
all
their
precious
things
;
and
thus
they
should
pay
tubute
to
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
,
from
year
to
year
.
And
now
there
was
one
of
the
sons
of
the
king
among
those

captive
,
whose
name
was
Limhi
.
And
now
Limhi
wes
desirous
that
his
father
should
not
be
destroyed
;
nevertheless
,
Limhi
was
not
ignorant
of
the
iniquities
of
his
futher
,
behimseli
,
being
a
just
man
.
And
it
caine
to
pass
that
Gideon
sent
men
into
the
wildertess
seercily
,
to
search
for
the
king
,
end
those
that
was
with
him
.
And
if
came
to
pass
that
they
met
the
people
in
the
wilderess
all
save
the
king
and
his
priests
.
Now
they
had
sworn
intheir
hearts
that
they
would
return
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
and
iltheir
wives
and
their
children
were
slain
,
and
also
those
that
lad
tamied
with
them
,
that
they
would
seek
revenge
,
and
also
Peish
with
them
.
And
the
king
commanded
them
that
they
thould
uot
return
;
and
they
were
angry
with
the
king
,
end
aed
that
he
should
suffer
,
even
unto
death
hy
fire
.
And
they
were
about
to
take
the
priests
also
und
put
them
to
death
,
tl
they
fled
before
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
about
to
return
to
the
lind
of
Nephi
,
and
they
met
the
men
of
Gideon
.
And
the
hen
of
Gideon
told
them
of
all
that
had
happened
to
their
Mes
end
their

;
and
that
the
Lamanites
had
granted
unto
them
that
they
inight
possess
the
land
,
by
paying
a
tris
hiteto
the
Lananites
of
one
half
of
all
they
possessed
.
And
the
people
told
the
men
of
G
-
deon
that
they
had
slain
the
king
,
ad
his
priests
had
fled
from

rejoicing
,
because
their

wives
and
their

were
not
slain
;
and
they
told
Gidegy
what
they
had
done
to
the
king
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
mat
an
oath
wnto
them
,
that
his
people
should

by

that

unto

,
eva

of

And
it
came
to

that
Limhi
began
to
establish

dom
,
and
to
establish
peace
among
his
people
.
_
And
the
kig
of
the
Lamanites
set

keep
the
people
of

in

,
that
they
might
not

;
and
he
did
support
his
guards

the
tribute
which
he
did
receive
from
the
Nephites
.
Andnoy
king
Limhi
did
have
continual
peace
in
his
kingdom
,
for
th
the
space
of
two
years
,
that
the
Lamanites
did
not
molest
they
nor
seek
to
destroy
them
.
Now
there
was
a
place
in
Shemlon
,
where
the
daugbters
the
Lamanites
did
gather
themselves
together
for
to
sing
,
ai
to
dance
,
and
to
make
themselves
merry
.
And
it
came
to
pus
that
there
was
one
day
a
small
number
of
them
gathered
&
gether
to
sing
and
to
dance
.
And
now
the
priests
of
bir
Noah
,
being
ashamed
to
return
to
the
city
of
Nephi
,
yea
,
#
also
fearing
that
the
people
would
slay
them
,
therefore
te
durst
not
return
to
their
wives
and
their
children
.
And
he
ing
tarried
in
the
wilderness
,
and
having
discovered
the
dau

ters
of
the
Lamanites
,
they
laid
and
watched
them
;
and
we
there
were
but
few
of
them
gathered
together
to
dance
,
lle
came
forth
out
of
their

places
,
and
took
them
and

them
into

;
yea
,
twenty
and
four
of
the

of
the
Lamanites
they
carried
into
the
wilderness
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lamanites
found
tht
their
daughters
had
been
missing
,
they
were
angry
with
people
of
Limi
;
for
they
thought
it
was

Therefore
they
sent
their
armies

they
went

And
now
Limhi

discovered
them
from

;
even
all
their
preparal
for

did
he
discover
;
therefore
he
gathered

,
and
laid

And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lamanites
had
comei
that
the
people
of
Limhi
began
to
fall
upon
them
from
#
waiting
places
,
and
began
to
slay
them
.
[File:201]
Andit
came
to
pass
that
the
battle
became
exceeding
sore
,
for
they
fought
like
Kons
for
their
prey
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
Limhi
began
to
drive
the
Lamanites
before
them
,
yet
they
were
not
half
so
numerous
as
the
Lamanites
.
But
they
fought
for
their
lives
,
and
for
their
wives
,
and
for
their
children
;
therefore
they
exerted
themselves
,
and
like
dragons
did
they
fight
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
found
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
among
the
number
of
their
dead
;
yet
he
was
not
dead
,
haying
been
wounded
and
left
upon
the
ground
,
so
speedy
was
the
fight
of
his
people
.
And
they
took
bim
and
bound
up
his
wounds
,
and
brought
him
before
Limhi
,
and
said
,
Behold
,
here
isthe
king
of
the
Lamanites
;
he
having
received
a
wound
,
hath
fallen
among
their
dead
,
and
they
have
left
him
;
and
behold
,
we
have
brought
him
hefore
you
;
and
now
let
us
slay
him
.
But
Limhi
saith
unto
them
,
Ye
shall
not
slay
him
,
but
bring
him
hither
,
that
I
may
see
him
.
And
they
brought
him
,
And
Limhi
saith
unto
him
,
What
cause
have
ye
to
come
up
to
war
against
my
people
?
Behold
,
my
people
have
not
broken
the
oath
that
I
made
unto
you
;
therefore
,
why
should
ye
break
the
oath
which
ye
made
unto
my
people
?
And
now
the
king
said
,
I
have
broken
the
oath
,
because
thy
people
did
earry
away
the
daughters
of
my
people
;
therefore
in
my
anger
Idid
cause
my
people
to
come
up
to
war
against
thy
people
.
Now
Limhi
had
heard
nothing
concerning
this
matter
;
therefore
he
saith
,
[
will
search
aniong
my
people
,
and
whosoever
.
hath
done
this
thing
shall
perish
.
Therefore
he
caused
a
search
io
be
made
among
his
people
.
Now
when
Gideon
had
heard
these
things
,
he
being
the
king's
captain
,
he
went
forth
and
sid
unto
the
king
,
I
pray
thee
forbear
,
and
do
not
seareh
this
people
,
and
lay
not
this
thing
to
their
charge
.
For
do
ye
not
remember
the
priests
of
thy
father
,
which
this
people
sought
to
desiroy
?
And
are
they
not
in
the
wilderness
?
And
is
it
not
they
which
have
stolen
the
daughters
of
the
Lamanites
?
And
now
behold
,
and
tell
the
king
of
these
things
,
that
he
may
tel}
his
people
,
that
they
may
be
pacified
towards
us
:
for
behold
,
they
are
already
preparing
to
come
against
us
;
and
behold
al%
,
there
are
but
few
of
us
.
And
behold
,
they
come
with
their
humerous
hosts
;
and
except
the
king
doth
pacify
them
towards
US
,
We
must
perish
.
For
are
not
the
words
of
Abinadi
fulfilled
,
Which
he
prophesied
against
us
?
and
all
this
because
we
would
,
not
hearken
unto
the
word
of
the
Lord
,
and
turn
from
our
Mquities
?
And
now
let
us
pacify
the
king
,
and
we
fulfil
the
[File:202]
ath
which
we
have
made
unto
him
:
for
it
is
better
that
ye
should
be
in
bondage
,
than
that
we
should
lose
our
lives
:
therefore
,
let
us
put
a
stop
to
the
shedding
of
so
mach
blood
And
now
Limhi
told
the
king
all
the
things
concerning
his
f
,
ther
,
and
the
priests
that
had
fled
into
the
wilderness
,
and
a
tributed
the
carrying
away
of
their
daughters
to
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
was
pacified
towards
his
people
;
and
he
said
unto
them
,
Let
us
go
forth
to
meet
ny
people
,
without
arms
;
and
I
swear
unto
you
with
an
outh
,
the
my
people
shall
not
slay
thy
people
.
And
it
came
to
pag
that
they
followed
the
king
,
and
went
forth
without
arms
meet
the
Lamanites
,
And
it
cainc
to
pass
that
they
did
meg
the
Lamanites
;
and
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
did
bow
lin
.
self
down
before
them
,
and
did
plead
in
behalf
of
the
poo
of
Linhi
,
And
when
the
Lamanites
saw
the
people
of
Jimi
that
they
were
without
arms
,
they
had

,
and
returned
with
their
king
in
peace
to
their
own
land
.
nd
it
came
to
pass
that
Limhi
and
his
people
returned
the
city
of
Nephi
,
and
began
to
dwell
in

,
And
it
came

after
many
days
,
the
Lamanites
te

again
to
be
stirred
up
in
anger
against
the
Nephites
;
aml
they
began
to
come
into
the
borders
of
the
land
round
abod
,
Now
they
durst
not
slay
them
,
because
of
the
oath
which
thet
king
had
made
unto
Limhi
;
but
they
would
smite
them
their
cheeks
,
and
exercise
authority
over
them
;
and
begin
put
heavy
burdens
upon
their
backs
,
and
drive
themas
they

dumb
ass
;
yea
,
all
this
was
done
,
that
the
worl
d
the
Lord
might
be
fulfilled
.
And
now
the
afflictions
of
te
Nephites
was
great
;
and
there
was
no
way
that
they
could
de
Jiver
themselves
out
of
their
hands
,
for
the
Lamanites
hal
surrounded
them
on
every
side
.
And
it
came
1o

that

to

,
because

;
and
they

And
they

therefore
he

the
Lamanites
,
to
drive
them
out
their
land
.
And
it
came
to
pess
that
the
Lamanites
did
heat
them
,
and
drove
them
back
,
and
lew
many
of
them
,
And
now
there
was
a
greut
morrning
and
lamentation
:
whong
fhe
people
of
Limhi
;
the
widow
mourning
for
her
husband
;
the
[File:203]
son
and
the
daughter
mourning
for
their
father
;
and
the
brothers
for
their
brethren
.
Now
there
were
a
great
man
widows
in
the
land
;
and
they
did
cry
mightily
from
day
to
day
,
for
a
great
fear
of
the
Lamanites
had
come
upon
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
their
continual
cries
did
stir
up
the
remainder
of
the
people
of
Limhi
to
anger
,
against
the
Lamanites
.
And
they
went
again
to
batile
;
but
they
were
driven
back
again
,
suffering
much
toss
,
Yea
,
they
went
again
,
even
the
third
time
,
and
suifered
in
the
like
manner
;
and
those
that
were
not
slain
,
returned
again
to
the
city
of
Nephi
.
And
they
did
humble
themselves
even
to
the
dust
,
subjecting
themsclyes
to
the
yoke
of
bondage
,
submitting
themselves
to
be
smitten
,
and
to
he
driven
to
and
fro
,
and
burdened
,
according
to
the
desires
of
their
enemies
.
And
they
did
humble
themselves
even
in
the
depths
of
humility
;
and
they
did
ery
mightily
to
God
;
yea
,
even
all
the
day
long
did
they
cry
unio
their
God
,
that
he
would
deliver
them
out
of
their
afflictions
.
And
now
the
Lord
was
slow
to
hear
their
cry
,
because
of
their
iniquihes
;
nevertheless
the
Lord
did
hear
their
eries
,
and
began
to
wollen
the
hearts
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
began
to
ease
their
burdens
:
yet
the
Lord
did
not
see
fit
to
deliver
them
out
of
bondage
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
prosper
by
degrees
inthe
land
,
and
began
to
raise
grain
more
abundantly
,
and
flocks
,
and
herds
,
that
they
did
not
suffer
with
hunger
,
Now
there
was
a
great
number
of
women
more
than
there
was
of
hen
;
therefore
king
Limhi
commanded
that
every
man
should
impart
to
the
support
of
the
widows
and
their
children
,
that
they
might
not
perish
with
hunger
:
and
this
they
did
,
because
ofthe
greatness
of
their
number
that
had
been
slain
.
Now
the
people
of
Limhi
kept
together
in
a
body
as
much
as
it
was
Possible
,
and
sccure
their
grain
,
and
their
flocks
;
and
the
king
himself
did
not
trust
his
person
withoui
the
walls
of
the
city
,
unless
he
took
his
guards
with
him
,
fearing
that
he
might
by
Some
means
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
he
taused
that
his

by

that

for

le
discovered

he
was
filled
with
exceeding
great
joy
—
Now
king
Limhi
had
sent

previous
to

,
a
sinall
number
of
men
to
search
for

land
of

but
they
could
not
find

:
and
they
were
lost
in

Nevertheless
they
did
find
a
land
which
had
been
pes
pled
;
yea
,
a
land
which
was
covered
with
dry
bones
;
yea

tand
which
had
been
peopled
,
and
which
had
been
destroyed
;
and
they
having
supposed
it
to
be
the
land
of
Zarahenla
,
we
turned
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
having
arrived
in
the
borders
the
Jand
not
many
days
before
the
coming
of
Ammon

Ani
they
brought
a
record
with
them
,
even
a
record
of
the
peopl
w
ose
bones
they
had
found
;
and
they
were
engraven
on
plate
of
ore
.
And
now
Limhi
was
again
filled
with
joy
,
on
learning
from
the
mouth
of
Ammon
that
king
Benjamin
bad
a
gift
from
God
,
whereby
he
could
interpret
such
engravings
;
yea
,
al
Ammon
also
did
rejoice
,
Yet
Ammon
and
his
brethren
wer
filled
with
sorrow
,
because
so
many
of
his
brethren
had
bea
slain
;
and
also
that
king
Noah
and
his
priests
had
caustl
the
people
to
commit
so
many
sins
and
iniquities
against
God
;
and
they
also
did
mourn
for
the
death
of
Abinadi
;

also
la
the
departure

the

by
Abinadi

yea
,
they
did
mourn
for
their
departure
,
for
they
knew
not
whither
they
had
fled
.
Now
they
would
have
gladl
joined
with
them
,
for
they
themselves
had
entered
into

with
God

to

And

Alma

that
the
armies
ef
king
Noah
would
come
upon

and
had
made

therefore
they
gathered

their
flocks
,
and
took
of
their
grain
,
and
departed
into
the
wilderness
hefore
the
armies
of
king
Noah

And
the
Lord
did
strengthen
them
,
that
[File:207]
ihe
people
of
king
Noah
could
not
overtake
them
,
'
to
destroy
them
,
And
it
came
to

that
they
fled
cight
days'
journey
into
the
wilderness
.
And
they
came
toa
land
,
yea
,
even
avery
beautiful
and
pleasant
land
;
a
land
of
pure
water
.
And
if
came
fo
pass
that
they
pitched
their
tents
,
and
began
to
till
the
ground
,
and
began
to
build
buildings
,
&e
.;
yea
,
they
were
industrious
,
and
did
labor
exceedingly
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
were
desirous
that
Alma
should
be
their
king
,
for
he
was
beloved
by
his
people
.
But
he
saith
unto
them
,
Behold
,
itis
not
expedient
that
we
should
have
a
king
;
for
thus
saith
the
Lord
:
Ye
shall
not
esteem
one
flesh
above
another
,
or
one
man
shall
not
think
himsclf
above
another
;
therefore
F
say
unto
you
,
It
is
not
expedient
that
ye
should
have
a
king
.
Nevertheless
,
if
it
were
possible
that
ye
could
always
have
just
men
to
be
your
kings
,
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
have
a
king
.
But
remember
the
iniquity
of
king
Noah
and
his
priests
:
and
I
myself
was
caught
in
a
snare
,
and
did
many
things
which
was
abominable
in
the
sight
of
the
Lord
,
which
caused
me
sore
repene
:
nevertheless
,
after
much
tribulation
,
the
Lord
did
vat
my
cries
,
and
did
answer
my
prayers
,
and
hath
made
me
an
instrument
in
his
hands
,
in
bringing
so
many
of
you
to
a
knowledge
of
his
truth
.
Nevertheless
,
in
this
I
do
not
glory
,
foram
unworthy
to
glory
of
myself
.
And
now
I
say
unto
you
,
As
ye
have
been
oppressed
by
king
Noah
,
and
have
been
in
bondage
to
him
and
his
priests
,
and
have
been
bronght
into
iniguity
by
them
;
therefore
ye
were

And
now
as
ye
have
been
delivered
,
by
the
power
of
Gor
,
out
of
these
bonds
;
yea
,
even
out
of

hands
of

Noah
and
his
people
,
and
also
from
the

of

,
ever

desire
that
ye
should

in
this
liberty

Je
have
been
made
free
,
and
that
ye
trustno
man
to
beaking
over
you
;
and
also
trusting
no
one
to
be
your
teachers
nor
you
ministers
,
except
he
be
a
man
of
God
,
walking
in
his
ways
an
keeping
his
commandments
,
Thus
did
Alma
teach
his
people
,
that
every
man
should
love
his
neighbor
as
himself
;
that
there
should
be
no
contention
among
them
.
And
now
Alma
was
their
high
priest
,
he
being
the
founder
of
their
Church
,
And
ifcame
to
pass
that
none
reecived
authority
to
preach
or
to
.
teach
,
except
it
were
by
him
from
God
.
Therefore
he
consecrated
all
their
priests
,
and
all
their
teachers
,
and
none
were
Conseerated
except
it
were
just
men
.
Therefore
they
did
watch
over
their
people
,
and
did
nourish
thom
with
things
pertaining
forightcousness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
pros
[File:208]
per
exceedingly
in
the
land
;
and
they
called
the
land
Helay
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
multiply
and
prosper
exceed
.
ingly
in
ihe
land
of
Helam
;
and
they
built
a
city
,
whieh
they
called
Helam
.
Nevertheless
the
Lord
sceth
fit
to
chasten
his
people
;
yea
,
he
trieth
their
patience
and
their
faith
,
Never
theless
,
whosoever
puteth
his
trust
in
him
,
the
same
shell
he
lifted
up
at
the
lasiday
.
Yea
,
and
thus
it
was
with
this
people
,
For
beheld
,
I
will
shew
unto
you
that
they
were
brought
intp
bondage
,
and
none
could
deliver
them
but
the
Lord
their
Gad
;
yea
,
even
the
God
of
Abrahom
,
and
of
Isaac
,
andofJacob
.
Andit
came
to
pass
that
he
did
deliver
them
,
and
he
did
shew
forth
his
mighty
power
unto
them
,
and
great
was
their
rejoicing
For
behoid
,
it
eame
to
pass
that
while
they
were
in
the
land
of
Helam
,
yea
,
in
the
city
of
Helam
,
while
tilling
the
land
round
about
,
behold
an
army
of
the
Lamanites
were
in
the
bordersgj
the
land
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brethren
of
Alma
fled
from
their
fields
,
and
gathered
themselves
together
into
the
cily
of
Helam
;
and
they
were
much
frightened
because
of
the
appear
ance
of
the
Lamanites
.
But
Alma
went
forth
and
stood
among
them
,
and
exhorted
them
that
they
should
not'
be
frightened
but
that
they
should
remember
the
Lord
their
God
,
and
le
would
deliver
them
;
therefore
they
hushed
their
fears
,
and
be
gan
to
cry
unto
the
Lord
,
that
he
would
soften
the
hearts
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
would
spare
them
,
and
their
wives
,
an
)
their
children
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
soften
the
hearts
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
Alma
and
his
brethren
weal
forth
and
delivered
themselves
up
into
their
hands
;
and
the
Le
ainanites
took
possession
of
the
land
of
Helam
.
Now
the
ar
)
iies
of
the
Lamanites
which
had
followed
after
the
people
@
ling
Limhi
,
had
been
lost
in
the
wilderness
for
many
days
.
And
behold
,
they
had
found
those
priests
of
king
Noah
,
ina
place
which
they
called
Amulon
;
and
they
had
began
to
pos
sess
the
land
of
Amulon
,-
and
had
began
to
till
the
ground
Now
the
name
of
the
leader
of
those
priests
was
Amulon
.
Ani
it
came
to
pass
that
Amulon
did
plead
with
the
Lamanites
;
and
he
also
sent
forth
their
wives
,
which
was
the
daughters
of
the
Lamanites
,
to
plead
with
their
brethren
,
that
they
should
aol
destroy
their
husbands
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamuatr
ites
had
compassion
on
Amulon
and
his
brethren
,
and
did
no
!
destroy
them
,
because
of
their
wives
.
And
Amulon
and
bis
brethren
did
join
the
Lamanites
,
and
they
were
travelling
in
tit
wilderness
in
search
of
the
land
of
Nephi
,
when
they
diseovertd
the
land
of
Helam
,
which
was
possessed
by
Alma
and
his
brell
[File:209]
ren
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
promised
unto
Alma
and
his
brethren
,
that
if
they
would
shew
them
the
way
which
led
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
that
they
would
grant
unto
them
their
lives
and
their
liberty
.
But
itcame
to
pass
that
after
Alma
had
shewn
them
the
way
that
led
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
the
Lamauites
would
not
keep
their
promise
;
but
they
sct
guards
yound
about
the
land
of
Helem
,
over
Alma
and
his
brethren
.
And
the
remainder
of
them
went
to
the
land
of
Nephi
;
and
a
art
of
them
returned
to
the
land
of
Helam
,
and
also
brought
with
them
the
wives
and
the
children
of
the
guards
which
had
been
left
in
the
Jand
.
And
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
had
granted
unto
Amulon
that
he
should
be
a
king
and
a
ruler
over
his
people
,
which
was
in
the
land
of
Helam
;
nevertheless
he
should
have
no
power
to
do
any
thing
contrary
to
the
will
of
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amulon
did
gain
favor
in
the
eyes
ot
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
;
therefore
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
granted
unto
him
and
his
brethren
,
that
they
should
be
appoiited
teachers
over
his
people
;
yea
,
even
over
the
,
people
which
was
in
the
land
of
Shemlon
,
and
in
the
land
of
Shilom
,
and
in
the
land
of
Amulon
:
for
the
Lamanites
had
taken
possession
of
all
these
lands
;
therefore
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
had
appointed
kings
oyer
all
these
lands
.
And
now
the
name
of
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
was
Laman
,
being
called
alter
the
nane
of
his
father
;
and
therefore
he
was
called
king
Laman
.
And
he
was
king
over
a
numerous
people
;
and
he
appointed
teachers
of
the
brethren
of
Amulon
,
in
every
land
which
was
possessed
by
his
people
:
and
thus
the
language
of
Nephi
began
to
be
taught
among
all
the
people
of
the
Lamaniies
,
And
they
were
a
people
friendly
one
with
another
;
nevertheless
they
knew
not
God
;
neither
did
the
brethren
of
Amulon
teach
.
them
any
ibing
concerning
the
Lord
their
God
,
neither
the
law
of
Moses
;
nor
did
they
teach
them
the
words
of
Abinadi
;
but
they
taught
them
that
they
should
keep
their
record
,
and
that
they
might
write
one
to
another
.
And
thus
the
Lamanites
began
to
increase
in
riches
,
and
began
to
trade
one
with
another
,
and
wax
great
,
and
began
to
be
a
cunning
and
a
wise
people
,
as
to
the
wisdom
of
the
world
;
yea
,
a
very
cunning
people
;
delighting
in
all
manner
of
wickedness
and
plunder
,
except
it
Were
among
their
own
brethren
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Amulon
began
to
exercise
anMotity
over
Alma
and
his
brethren
,
and
.
began
to
persecnte
him
,
2nd
cause
that
his
children
should
persecute
their
children
:
G
[File:210]
for
Amulon
knew
Alma
,
that
he
had
been
one
of
the
King's
priests
,
and
that
it
was
he
that
believed
the
words
of
Abin
,
and
was
driven
out
before
the
king
;
and_
therefore
he
wa
wroth
with
him
,
for
he
was
subject
to
king
Laman
;
yet
he
ex
,
ercised
authority
over
them
,
and
put
tasks
upon
them
,
and
put
task
-
masters
over
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
so
great
wg
their
efllictions
,
that
they
begun
to
cry
mightily
to
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amulon
commanded
them
that
they
should
stop
their
cries
;
and
he
put
guatds
over
them
to
watch
then
that
whoseever
should
be
found
calling
upon
God
,
should
he
put
to
death
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
and
his
people
did
not
raise
their
voices
to
the
Lord
their
God
,
but
did
pour
out
their
hearts
to
him
;
and
he
did
know
the
thoughts
of
they
hearts
,
And
it
came
(
o
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
Lord
came
to
then
in
their
afflictions
,
saying
,
Litt
up
your
heads
and
be
of
good
comtort
,
for
I
know
of
the
covenant
which
ye
have
made
unio
me
;
and
I
will
covenant
with
my
people
,
and
deliver
them
oy
of
bondage
.
And
I
will
also
ease
the
burdens
which
is
put
up
on
your
shoulders
,
that
even
you
cannot
fecl
them
upou
your
backs
,
even
while
you
are
in
bondage
;
and
this
will
I
do
,
tht
ye
may
stand
as
witnesses
for
me
hereafter
,
and
that
ye
muy
know
of
a
surety
that
I
,
the
Lord
God
,
do
visit
my
pcople
it
their
afflictions
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
burdens
which
was
laid
upon
Alma
and
his
brethren
,
were
made
light
;
yea
,
the
Lord
did
strengthen
them
that
they
could
bear
up
their
hardens
with
ease
,
and
they
did
submit
cheerfully
and
with
pe
tience
to
all
the
will
of
the
Lord
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
.
so
great
was
their
faith
and
their
pa
fience
,
that
the
voice
of
the
Lord
came
unto
them
again
,
saying
,
Be
of
good
comfort
,
for
on
the
morrow
will
deliver
thee
out
ot
hendage
.
And
he
saith
unto
Alma
,
Thou
shalt
go
before
{his
7
people
,
gind
1
will
go
with
thee
,
and
deliver
this
people
out
of
hondage
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
and
his
people
,
in
the
night
tune
,
gathered
their
flocks
together
,
and
also
of
their
grain
;
yea
even
all
the
night
time
were
they
gathering
their
flocks
together
.
And
in
the
morning
the
Lord
caused
a
deep
sleep
to
come
upon
the
Lamanites
,
yea
,
and
all
their
task
-
masters
were
in
a
pre
found
sleep
.
And
it
-
came
to
pass
that
Alma
and
his
people
depurted
into
the
wilderness
;
and
when
they
hed
tr
-
yTled
all
day
,
they
pitched
their
tents
in
a
velley
,
and
they
called
the
velley
Alma
,
because
he
led
their
way
in
the
wilderness
;
yca
,
and
in”
[File:211]
the
valley
of
Alma
they
poured
out
their
thanks
to
God
because
he
had
been
merciful
unto
them
,
and
eased
their
burdens
,
and
jad
delivered
them
out
of
bondage
;
for
they
were
m
bondage
,
ond
none
could
deliver
them
,
except
it
were
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
they
gave
thanks
to
God
,
yea
,
ell
their
men
,
and
all
their
women
,
and
all
their
children
,
that
could
speak
,
lifted
their
yoices
in
the
praises
of
their
God
.
And
now
the
Lord
said
unto
Alma
,
Haste
thee
and
get
thou
and
this
people
out
of
this
land
,
for
the
Lamunites
have
awoke
and
doth
pursue
thee
;
therefore
get
thee
out
of
this
Jund
,
and
I
will
stop
the
Lamanites
in
this
valley
,
that
they
come
no
further
.
in
pursuit
of
this
people
,
And
it
came
to
puss
that
they
departed
out
of
the
valley
,
and
took
their
journey
into
the
wilderness
,
And
it
came
to
pass
thet
after
they
had
been
in
the
wik
demess
twelve
days
,
they
arrived
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
and
king
Mosiah
did
also
receive
them
with
joy
.
And
now
king
Mosiah
caused
that
all
the
people
should
be
gathered
together
.
Now
there
were
not
so
many
of
the
children
of
Nephi
,
or
sa
nany
of
those
which
were
descendants
of
Nephi
,
as
there
were
ofthe
people
of
Zavahemla
,
which
was
a
descendant
of
Mulok
,
and
those
which
came
with
him
into
the
wilderness
;
and
there
were
not
somany
of
the
people
of
Nephi
and
of
the
people
of
Zrahoula
as
there
was
ofthe
Lamanites
;
yea
,
they
were
not
half
ommerous
,
And
now
all
the
people
of
Nephi
was
assembled
logether
,
and
also
all
the
people
of
Zarahemla
,
and
they
were
gthered
together
in
two
bodies
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Mosiah
did
read
,
and
caused
to
be
nad
,
the
records
of
Zenitf
to
his
people
;
yea
,
he
read
the
recsts
of
the
people
of
Zenift
,
from
the
time
they
left
the
land
of
Zvahemla
until
the
time
they
returned
again
.
And
he
also
read
©
legeeount
of
Alma
and
his
brethren
,
and
all
their
sfilictions
,—
fom
the
time
they
loft
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
until
the
ti
Soy
returned
again
,
And
now
when
Mosiah
had
made
an
reading
the
records
,
his
people
which
tarried
in
the
land
was
timek
with
wonder
and
amazement
,
for
they
knew
not
what
to
isk
;
for
when
they
beheld
those
that
had
been
delivered
out
bondage
,
they
were
filled
with
exceeding
great
joy
.
And
again
,
when
they
thoneht
of
their
brethren
which
had
heen
slain
by
Lamanites
,
they
were
filled
with
sorrow
,
and
even
shed
matears
of
sorrow
.
And
again
,
when
they
thought
of
the
imTediate
goodness
of
God
,
ond
his
power
in
delivering
Alma
and
is
brethren
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
of
bondsge
,
bey
did
raise
their
voices
,
and
gaye
thanks
to
God
.
And
again
,
[File:212]
when
they
thought
upon
the
Lamanites
,
which
was
their
hr
,
ren
,
of
thei
siniul
and
polluted
stato
,
they
svere
filled
with
ai
and
anguish
,
for
the
welfare
of
their
souls
.
4
Ani
it
came
to
pass
that
when
those
which
were
the
childrey
of
Amulon
and
his
brethren
,
which
had
taken
to
wife
the
du
ters
of
the
Lamanites
,
they
were
displeased
with
the
cond
of
their
fathers
,
and
they
would
no
longer
be
called
by
th
names
of
their
fathers
;
therefore
they
took
upon
themselna
the
name
of
Nephi
,
that
they
might
be
called
the
children
g
Nephi
,
and
be
numbered
among
those
which
were
called
\
,
phites
,
And
now
all
the
people
of
Zarahemla
were
number
)
with
the
Nephites
,
and
this
because
the
kingdom
had
been
coy
ferred
upon
none
but
those
which
were
descendants
of
Nephi
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Mosiah
wed
made
end
of
speaking
and
reading
to
the
people
,
he
desired
thatdl
ma
should
also
speak
to
the
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
thy
Alma
did
spealc
unto
them
,
when
they
were
assembled
togethy
in
large
bodies
,
and
he
went
from
one
body
to
another
,
prea
ing
unto
the
people
repentance
and
faith
on
the
Lord
.
Ay
he
did
exhort
the
people
of
Limhi
and
his
brethren
,
all
thoy
that
had
been
delivered
out
of
bondage
,
that
they
-
should
remen
.
ber
that
it
was
the
Lord
that
did
deliver
them
.
Aud
it
to
pass
that
afier
Alma
had
taught
the
people
many
things
,
al
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
to
them
,
that
king
Limhi
wa}
desirous
that
he
might
be
baptized
;
and
all
lis
people
wey
desirous
that
they
might
be
baptized
also
.
Therefore
Ali
did
go
forth
into
the
water
,
and
did
baptize
them
;
yea
,
he
di
baptize
them
afier
the
manner
he
did
his
brethren
in
the
water
of
Moymon
,;
yea
,
and
as
many
as
he
did
baptize
did
belongt
the
Church
of
God
;
and
this
because
of
their
belief
on
words
of
Alma
.
_
Andit
came
to
pass
that
king
Mosiah
granted
unto
Aln
that
be
might
establish
Churches
throughout
all
the
land
Zarahemla
;
and
gave
him
power
to
ordain
priests
and
teadl
over
every
Church
.
Now
this
was
done
because
there
so
many
people
that
they
could
not
all
be
governed
by
teacher
;
neither
could
they
all
hear
the
word
of
God
in
assembly
;
therefore
they
did
assemble
themselves
together
dilferent
bodies
,
beingcalled
Churches
;
every
Church
havi
their
priests
and
their
teachers
,
and
every
priest
prea
the
word
according
as
it
was
delivered
to
him
by
the
mol
of
Alma
;
and
thus
,
notwithstanding
there
being
many
Chu
they
were
all
one
Church
;
yea
,
even
the
Church
of
God
:!
[File:213]
there
was
nothing
preached
in
all
the
Ghurches
except
it
were
repeulance
Churches
in
the
and
faith
in
God
.
And
now
there
was
seven
land
of
Zarahemla
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
Was
desirous
to
take
upon
them
the
name
of
Christ
,
or
of
God
,
they
did
join
the
churches
of
God
;
and
they
were
called
the
people
of
God
.
And
the
Lord
did
pour
out
his
spirit
upon
them
jand
.
Now
it
came
t
and
they
were
blest
,
and
prospered
in
the
©
pass
that
there
was
many
of
the
rising
ge
aeration
that
could
not
understand
the
words
of
king
Benjamin
,
being
hittle
children
at
the
time
he
spake
unto
his
people
;
and
they
did
not
did
not
believe
y
tion
of
the
dead
;
believe
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
.
They
vhat
had
been
:
said
concerning
the
resurrecneither
did
they
believe
concerning
the
com
ng
of
Chrixt
.
And
now
because
of
their
unbelief
,
they
could
wotunderstand
the
word
of
God
;
and
their
hearts
were
har
dened
,
And
they
would
net
be
baptized
;
neither
would
they
join
the
church
,
And
they
were
a
separate
people
as
to
their
faith
,
and
remained
so
ever
after
,
even
in
their
carnal
and
sin
fill
state
:
for
the
y
would
not
call
upon
the
Lord
their
God
.—
4nd
now
in
the
reign
of
Mosiah
,
they
were
not
half
so
nume
tous
as
the
peoy
ple
of
God
;
hut
because
of
the
dissentions
tong
the
brethren
,
they
beeame
more
numerous
,
For
it
fame
to
pass
that
they
did
deceive
many
with
their
flattering
words
,
which
were
in
the
church
,
and
did
cause
them
to
comhit
many
sins
;
therefore
it
became
expedient
that
those
who
onmitted
sin
.
th
by
the
church
,
Andit
came
to
at
was
in
the
church
,
should
be
admonished
i
pass
that
they
were
brought
before
the
priests
,
ad
delivered
up
unto
the
priests
by
,
the
teachers
;
and
the
Mests
brought
them
before
Alma
,
which
was
the
high
priest
,
_
bw
king
Mosialy
had
given
Alma
the
authority
over
the
church
And
,
it
ming
them
,
for
there
were
many
witnesses
against
them
;
came
to
pass
that
Alma
did
not
know
eon
a
,
the
people
stood
and
testified
of
their
iniquity
in
abunfae
.
Now
there
had
not
any
such
thing
happened
hetore
,
athe
church
;
therefore
Alma
was
troubled
in
his
spirit
,
and
taused
that
they
should
be
brought
before
the
king
.
And
saith
unto
the
king
,
Behold
,
here
are
many
which
we
have
usht
before
thee
,
which

accused

And

;
therefore
we
have
brought
them

to
their

crimes
.
But
king
Mosiah
saith
unto
Alma
,
Beholdy
1
jute
them
nots
thevedore
deliver
them
into
thy
hands
to
be
judges
,
And
now
the
spirit
of
Alma
was
again
troubled
;
and
he
wey
and
inquired'
of
the
Lord
what
he
should
do
concerning
thir
matier
,
for
he
feared
that
he
should
do
wrong
ii
the
sight
God
.
Aud
it
came
to
pass
that
after
he
had
poured
ont
his
whi
soul
to
God
,
the
voice
of
the
Lord
came
to
him
,
saying
Blessed

Alma
;
and
blessed
are
they
which

Go

and

and

shall

time

.
And
it
came
to
pass
when
Alma
had
heard
these
words
,
he
wrote
them
down
,
that
he
might
have
them
,
and
that
he
might
judge
the
people
of
that
church
,
according
to
the
command
ments
of
God
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
went
and
judged
those
that
had
been
taken
in
iniquity
,
according
to
the
word
of
the
.
Lord
,
And
whosoever
repented
of
theiv
sins
and
did
confess
them
,
them
he
did
number
among
the
people
of
the
church
;
and
them
that
would
not
confess
their
sins
and
repent
of
their
iniquity
,
the
same
were
not
numbered
among
the
people
of
the
chureh
,
and
their
names
were
blotted
out
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
did
regulate
all
the
affairs
of
the
church
;
and
they
began
again
to
have
peace
,
and
to
prosper
exceedingly
in
ihe
affairs
of
the
church
;
walking
circumspectly
before
God
;
tecelving
many
,
and
baptizing
many
.
And
now
all
these
things
did
Alma
and
his
fellow
-
laborers
do
,
which
were
over
the
church
;
walking
in
all
diligence
;
teaching
the
word
of
God
inal
things
;
suffering
all
manner
of
afflictions
;
being
persecuted
by
all
those
who
did
nat
belong
to
the
church
of
God
.
And
they
did
admonish
their
brethren
;
and
they
were
also
admonished
,
every
one
,
by
the
word
of
God
,
according
to
his
sins
,
or
to
the
sins
which
he
had
committed
;
bemg
commanded
ol”
God
to
pray
without
ceasing
,
and
to
give
thanks
in
all
things
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
persecutions
which
was
intcted
on
the
chureh
by
the
unbelievers
,
became
so
great
,
that
the
church
began
to
murmur
,
and
complain
to
their
leaders
toncerning
the
matter
;
and
they
did
complain
to
Alma
.
And
Almalaid
the
case
before
their
King
,
Mosiah
.
And
Mosiah
Consulted
with
his
priests
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Mosiah
set
a
proclamation
thronghout
the
Jand
round
about
,
that
there
should
not
.
any
believer
persecute
any
of
those
which
belonged
to
the
church
af
God
;
and
there
was
a
strict
command
throughout
all
the
[File:216]
churches
,
that
there
should
be
no
persecutions
among
them
;
that
there
should
be
an
equality
among
all
men
;
that
they
should
let
no
pride
nor
haughtiness
disturb
their
peace
;
that
eyery
man
should
esteem
his
neighbor
as
himself
,
laboring
with
their
own
hands
for
their
support
;
yea
,
and
all
their'
priest
and
teachers
should
labor
with
their
own
hands
-
for
their
sup
.
port
,
in
all
cases
save
it
were
in
sickness
,
or
in
much
want
;
and
doing
these
things
,
they
did
abound
in
the
grace
of
God
,
And
there
began
to
be
much
peace
again
in
the
land
;
and
the
people
began
to
be
very
numerous
,
and
began
to
scatter
abroad
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
;
yea
,
on
the
north
and
on
the
south
,
on
the
east
and
on
the
west
,
building
large
citics
and
villages
in
all
quarters
of
the
land
.
And
the
Lord
did
visit
them
and
prosper
them
,
and
they
becume
a
large
and
a
wealthy
people
,
Now
the
sons
of
Mosiah
was
numbered
among
the
unbe
levers
;
and
also
one
of
the
sons
of
Alma
was
numbered
among
them
,
he
being
called
Alma
,
after
his
father
;
nevertheless
he
became
a
very
wicked
and
an
idolatrous
man
.
And
he
was
a
man
of
many
words
,
and
did
speak
much
flattery
to
the
people
;
therefore
he
led
many
of
the
people
to
do
alr
the
manner
of
his
iniquities
.
And
he
became
a
great
hinder
ment
to
the
prosperity
of
the
church
of
God
;
stealing
away
the
hearts
of
the
people
;
causing
much
dissention
among
the
peo
ple
;
giving
a
chance
for
the
enemy
of
God
to
exercise
his
power
over
them
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
while
he
was
going
about
to
destroy
the
church
of
God
:
for
he
did
go
about
sccretly
with
the
sons
of
Mosiah
,
seeking
to
destroy
the
church
,
and
to
lead
astray
the
people
of
the
Lord
,
contrary
to
the
commandments
of
God
,
or
even
the
king
;
and
as
I
said
unto
you
,
as
they
were
going
about
rebelling
against
God
,
behold
,
the
angel
al
the
Lord
appeared
unto
them
;
and
he
deseended
as
if
wer
in
a
cloud
;
and
he
spake
as
it
were
with
a
voice
of
thunder
,
which
caused
the
earth
to
shake
upon
which
they
stood
;
and
so
great
was
their
astonishment
,
that
they
fell
to
the
earth
,
and
understood
not
the
words
which
he
spake
unto
them
.
Never
theless
he
cried
again
,
saying
,
Alma
,
arise
,
and
stand
forth
,
for
why
persecuteth
thou
the
church
of
God
?
For
the
Lord
hath
said
,
This
is
my
church
,
and
}
will
establish
it
;
and
nothing
shall
overthrow
it
,
saye
it
is
(
he
transgression
of
my
people
And
again
:
The
angel
saith
,
Behold
,
the
Lord
hath
heard
the
prayers
of
his
people
,
and
also
the
prayers
of
his
servant
Al
ma
,
which
is
thy
father
:
for
he
hath
prayed
with
much
failk
[File:217]
concerning
thee
,
that
thou
mightest
be
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
;
therefore
for
this
urpose
have
I
come
to
ronvince
thee
of
the
power
and
authority
of
God
,
that
the
prayers
of
bis
servants
might
be
answered
according
to
their
faith
.
And
now
behold
,
can
ye
dispute
the
power
of
God
?
Forbehold
,
doth
not
my
voice
shake
the
earth
?
And
can
ye
not
also
behold
me
before
you
?
And
Tamsent
from
God
.
Now
I
say
unto
thee
,
Go
,
and
remember
the
captivity
of
thy
fathers
in
the
Jand
of
Helam
,
and
in
the
land
of
Nephi
;
and
remember
how
great
things
he
hath
done
for
them
:
for
they
were
in
bondage
,
and
he
hath
delivered
them
.
And
now
I
say
unto
thee
,
Alma
,
Go
thy
way
,
and
seek
to
destroy
the
church
no
more
,
that
their
prayers
may
be
answered
,
and
this
even
if
thou
wilt
of
thyself
be
cast
off
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
these
were
the
last
words
which
the
angel
spake
unto
Alma
,
and
he
departed
.
And
now
Alma
,
and
those
that
were
with
him
,
fell
again
to
the
earth
,
for
great
was
their
astonishment
:
for
with
their
own
eycs
they
had
beheld
an
angel
of
the
Lord
;
and
his
voice
was
as
thunder
,
which
shook
the
carth
;
and
they
knew
that
there
was
nothing
save
the
power
of
God
,
that
could
shake
the
earth
and
cause
it
to
tremble
,
as
-
though
it
would
part
asunder
,
And
now
the
astonishinent
of
Alma
was
so
great
,
that
he
became
dumb
,
that
he
could
not
open
his
mouth
;
yea
,
and
he
became
weak
,
even
that
he
could
not
move
his
hands
;
therefore
le
was
taken
by
those
that
were
with
him
,
and
carried
helpless
,
even
until
he
was
laid
before
his
father
.
And
they
rehearsed
unto
his
father
all
that
had
happened
unto
them
;
and
his
father
rejoiced
,
for
he
knew
that
?
was
the
power
of
God
.
And
he
caused
that
a
multitude
should
be
gathered
together
,
that
they
might
witness
what
the
Lord
had
done
for
bis
son
,
and
aso
for
those
that
were
with
him
.
And
he
caused
that
the
prests
should
assemble
themselves
together
;
and
they
began
{0
fast
,
and
to
pray
to
the
Lord
their
God
,
that
he
would
open
the
mouth
of
Alma
,
that
he
might
speak
;
and
also
that
bis
linbs
might
receive
their
strength
,
that
the
eyes
of
the
people
aan
opened
to
see
and
know
of
the
goodness
and
glory
of
OG
.
And
it
came
to
pass
after
they
had
fasted
and
prayed
for
the
space
of
two
days
and
two
nights
,
the
limbs
of
Alma
received
their
strength
,
and
he
stood
up
and
began
to
speak
unto
them
,
bidding
them
to
be
of
good
comfort
:
for
,
said
he
,
have
repented
of
my
sins
,
and
have
been
redeemed
of

Lord
;
behold

And
the
Lord
said
unto
me
,
Marvel
not
that
all
mankind

yea
,
men
,
and

all

and
fallen
st
to
a
state
of
righteousness
,
being
redeemed
of
God
,
becoming
duis
sons
and
daughters
;
and
thus
they
become
new
creatures
;
and
unless
they
do
this
,
they
can
in
no
wise
inherit
the
King

of
God
.
Isay
unto
you
,
unless
this
be
the
case
,
they
must
be
cast
off
:
and
this
I
know
,
because
]
was
like
to
be
cast
off
.
Nevertheless
,
after
wandering
through
much
triby
jation
,
repenting
nigh
unto
death
,
the
Lord
in
merey
hath
seep
fit
to
snatch
me
out
of
an
everlasting
burning
,
and}
am
bom
of
God
;
my
soul
hath
been
redeemed
from
the
gall
of
bites
ness
and
bonds
of
iniquity
.
I
was
in
the
darkest
abyss
;
but
aow
I
behold
the
marvellous
light
of
God
.
My
soul
was
wreck
ed
with
eternal
iorment
;
but
am
snatched
,
and
my
soul
#
pained
no
more
,
I
rejected
my
Redeemer
,
and
denied
that
which
had
heen
spoken
of
by
our
fathers
;
but
now
that
they
may
foresee
that
he
wilt
come
,
and
that
he
remembereth
every
creature
of
his
creating
,
and
he
will
make
himself
manifed
unio
all
;
yea
,
every
knee
shall
bow
,
and
every
tongue
confey
before
him
.
Yea
,
even
at
the
last
day
,
when
all
men
shal
atand
to
be
judged
of
him
,
then
shall
they
confess
that

;
then
shall
they
confess
,
who
live
without
God
in
the
world
,
that
the
judgment
of
an
everlasting
punishment
is
jut
upon
them
;
and
they
shall
quake
,
and
tremble
,
and
shrink
beneath
the
glance
of
his
all
-
searching
eye
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
began
from
{his
time

,
to
teach
the
pcople

and
those
which

at
the
time
the

appeared
unto
them
;

about
through

to
all
the
people
the
things
which
they
had
heard
and
seen
,
and
preaching

of
God
in
much
tribulation
,
being
greatly
persecuted
by
those
which
were
unbelievers
,
being
smitten
by
many
of
them
;
but
notwithstanding
all
this
,
they
did
impart
much
consolation
to
the
church
,
confirming
their
faith
,
and
exhorting
them

And

and
Aaron

and

CHAPTER

.
Now
if
came
fo
pass
that
after
the
sons
of
Mosiah
had
done
all
these
things
,
they
took
a
small
number
with
them
,
and
returoed
to
their
father
,
the
king
,
and
desired
of
him
that
he
would
grant
unto
them
,
that
they
might
,
with
these
whom
they
tad
sclected
,
go
up
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
that
they
might
preach
the
things
which
they
had
heard
,
and
that
they
might
impart
the
word
of
God
(
o
their
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
,
that
pethaps
they
might
bring
them
to
the
knowledge
of
the
Lord
their
God
,
and
convince
them
of
the
iniquity
of
their
fathers
and
that
perhaps
they
might
cure
them
of
their
hatred
towards
the
Nephites
,
that
they
might
also
be
brought
to
rejoice
in
the
Lord
their
God
,
that
they
might
become
friendly
to
one
anothcr
,
and
that
there
should
be
no
more
contentions
in
all
the
land
which
the
Lord
their
God
hath
given
them
.
Now
they
were
desirous
that
salvation
should
be
declared
to
every
ereature
,
for
they
could
not
bear
that
any
human
soul
should
perish
;
yea
,
even
the
very
thoughts
that
any
soul
should
endure
illess
torment
,
did
cause
them
to
quake
and
tremble
.
And
this
did
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
work
upon
them
,
for
they
were
the
very
vilest
of
simmers
.
And
the
Lord
saw
fit
in
his
infinite
mercy
to
spare
them
;
nevertheless
they
suffered
much
anguish
of
soul
,
because
of
their
iniquities
;
and
suffering
much
,
feardng
that
they
should
be
cast
off
forever
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
plead
with
their
father
many
days
,
that
they
might
go
up
to
the
Jand
of
Nephi
.
And
iteame
to
pass
that
king
Mosiah
went
and
inquired
of
the
Lord
,
if
he
should
Iet
his
sons
go
up
among
the
Lamanites
to
Preach
the
word
.
And
the
Lord
said
unto
Mosiah
,
Let
them
£0
up
,
for
jmany
shall
believe
on
their
words
,
and
they
shatk
[File:220]
have
eternal
life
;
and
I
will
deliver
thy
sons
out
of
the
bangs
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Mosiah
granted
that
they
mj
go
,
and
do
according
to
their
request
;
aud
they
took
ties
journey
into
.
the
wilderness
,
to
go
up
to
preach
the
worl
among
the
Lamanites
:
and
shall
give
an
account
of
the
proceedings
hereafter
.
Now
king
Mosiab
had
no
one
10
cop
.
ter
the
kingdom
upon
,
for
there
was
not
any
of
his
sons
whi
would
accept
of
the
kingdom
;
therefore
he
took
the
reconk
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
and
also
ily
plates
of
Nephi
,
and
all
the
things
which
he
had
kept
and
pre
served
,
according
to
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
aig
having
translated
and
caused
to
be
written
the
records
whid
were
on
the
plates
of
gold
,
which
had
been
found
by
the
px
,
ple
of
Limhi
,
which
was
delivered
to
him
by
the
hand
of
Ling
hi
:
and
this
he
done
,
because
of
the
great
anxicty
of
his
pa
ple
,
for
they
were
desirous
beyond
measure
,
to
know
congp
ning
those
people
which
lad
been
destroyed
..
And
now
k
translated
them
by
the
means
of
those
two
stones
which
we
fastened
into
the
two
rims
ef
a
bow
.
Now
these
things
ma
prepared
from
the
beginning
,
and
was
handed
down
from
gm
eration
to
generation
,
for
the
purpose
of
interpreting
langue
ges
;
and
they
have
been
kept
and
preserved
by
the
hand
@
the
Lord
,
that
he
should
discover
to
every
creature
which
should
possess
the
land
,
the
iniguities
and
abominations
his
people
:
and
whosoever
has
these
things
,
is
called
seer
,
after
the
manner
of
old
times
.
Now
after
Mosiah
had
finished
translating
these
records
behold
,
it
gave
an
account
of
the
people
which
was
destroyel
,
from
the
time
that
they
were
destroyed
,
back
to
the
building
of
the
great
tower
,
at
the
time
the
Lord
confounded
the
la
gauge
of
the
people
;
and
they
were
scattered
abroad
upm
the
face
of
all
the
earth
,
yea
,
and
even
from
that
time
unl
the
creation
of
Adam
.
Now
this
account
did
cause
the
pe
ple
of
Mosiah
to
mourn
exceedingly
;
yea
,
they
were
fillet
with
sorrow
;
nevertheless
it
gave
them
much
knowledge
,
i
the
which
they
did
rejoice
.
And
this
account
shall
be
written
hereafter
:
for
behold
,
it
is
expedient
that
all
people
should
know
the
things
which
are
written
in
this
account
.
[File:221]
:
CHAPTER
XU
And
now
,
as
T
said
unto
you
,
that
after
king
Mosiah
had
done
these
things
,
he
took
the
plates
of
brass
,
and
ail
the
things
which
he
had
kept
,
and
conferred
them
u
pon
Almia
,
which
was
the
son
of
Alma
;
yea
,
all
the
records
,
and
also
the
interpreters
,
and
conferred
them
upon
bim
,
and
commanding
bim
that
he
should
keep
and
preserve
them
,
and
also
keep
a
record
of
the
peopte
,
handing
them
down
from
one
generation
to
another
,
even
as
they
had
been
handed
down
from
the
time
that
Lehi
left
ferusatem
.
Now
when
Mosieh
had
done
this
,
he
sent
out
throughoui
al]
the
land
,
among
all
the
people
,
desiring
to
know
their
will
concerning
who
should
be
their
king
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
people
came
,
saying
:
We
are
desirous
that
Aaron
,
thy
son
,
should
be
our
king
,
and
our
ruler
.
Now
Aaron
had
gone
up
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
therefore
the
king
could
not
confer
the
kingdom
upon
him
;
neither
would
Aaron
take
upon
him
the
kingdom
;
neither
was
any
of
the
sons
of
Mosiah
willing
to
take
upon
them
the
kingdom
;
therefore
king
Mosiah
sent
again
among
the
people
,
yea
,
even
a
Wilten
word
sent
he
among
the
people
.
And
these
were
the
words
that
were
written
,
saying
:
Behold
,
O
ye
my
people
,
or
ny
brethren
,
for
l
esteem
you
as
such
;
for
I
desire
that
ye
should
consider
the
cause
which
ye
are
called
to
consider
;
for
Yeare
desirous
to
have
a
king
.
Now
f
declare
unto
you
,
that
leto
whom
the
kingdom
doth
uightly
belons
,
hath
declined
,
and
will
not
take
upon
him
the
kingdom
.
And
now
if
there
Swould
be
another
appointed
in
his
stead
,
behold
I
fear
there
would
rise
contentions
among
you
;
and
who
knoweth
but
whet
my
son
,
to
whom
the
kingdom
doth
belong
,
should
turn
tohe
angry
,
and
draw
away
a
part
of
this
people
after
him
,
Which
would
cause
wars
and
contentions
among
you
;
which
would
be
the
cause
of
shedding
much
blood
,
and
perverting
the
way
of
the
Lord's
yea
,
and
destroy
the
souls
of
much
peo~
ple
,
Now
I
say
unto
you
,
let
us
be
wise
and
consider
these
things
,
for
we
have
no
right
to
destray
my
son
,
neitlier
should
We
have
any
right
to
destroy
another
,
if
he
should
be
appointed
Iniis
stead
,
And
if
my
son
should
turn
again
to
his
pride
and
Vaio
things
,
he
would
recall
the
things
which
he
had
said
,
and
chim
his
right
to
the
kingdom
,
which
would
cause
him
and
80
this
people
to
commit
much
sin
.
And
now
let
us
be
wise
,
andlook
forward
to
these
things
,
and
do
that
which
will
make
or
the
peace
of
this
people
...
Therefore
£
will
be
your
king
[File:222]
the
remainder
of
my
days
;
nevertheless
,
let
us
appoint
judge
to
judge
this
people
according
to
our
law
,
and
we
will
newly
arrange
the
affairs
of
this
people
;
for
we
will
appoint
wis
men
to
be
judges
,
that
will
judge
this
people
according
to
the
commandments
of
God
.
Now
it
is
better
that
a
man
sho
be
judged
of
God
than
of
man
,
for
the
judgments
of
God
ay
always
just
,
but
the
judgments
of
man
are
.
not
always
just
;
therefore
,
if
it
were
possible
that
ye
could
have
just
men
toly
your
kings
,
which
would
establish
the
laws
of
God
,
and
judg
.
this
people
according
to
his
commandments
;
yea
,
if
ye
could
have
men
for
your
kings
,
which
would
do
even
as
my
father
Benjamin
did
for
this
people
;
I
say
unto
yon
,
if
this
could
a
.
-
ways
be
the
case
,
then
it
would
he
expedient
that
ye
shoul
always
have
kings
to
rule
over
you
.
And
even
I
,
myself
hase
labored
with
all
the
power
and
faculties
which
I
have
po
sessed
,
to
teach
you
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
to
esta}
lish
peace
throughout
the
land
,
that
there
should
be
no
way
nor
contentions
,
no
stealing
,
nor
plundering
,
nor
murdering
,
aior
no
manner
of
iniquity
;
and
whosoever
hath
committed
abignity
,
him
have
I
punished
according
to
the
crime
whit
he
hath
committed
,
according
to
the
law
which
hath
been
gis
en
to
us
by
our
fathers
,
Now
Tsay
unto
you
,
that
because
all
men
are
not
just
,
iti
not
expedicni
that
ye
should
have
a
king
or
kings
to
rule
ove
you
.
For
,
behold
,
how
much
iniquity
doth
one
wicked
king
cause
to
be
committed
!
yea
,
and
what
great
destruction
!
Yea
,
remember
king
Noah
,
his
wickedness
and
his
abomin
tions
.
and
also
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
his
people
,
Behold
what
great
destruction
did
come
upon
them
;
and
ale
hecause
of

But

I

,
Ye
cannot
dethrone
an
iniquitous
king
save
it
be
through
much
contention
,
and
the
shedding
of
much
blood
.
For
behold
,
he
hath
his
friends
in
iniquity
,
and

keepeth
his
guards
about
him
;
and
he
teareth

[File:223]

frampleth
under

fect
the

of
God
;
and
he
enacteth

,
and
sendeth
them
forth
among
his
people
;
yea
,
baws
after
the
manner
of
his
own
wickedness
:
and
whosoeyer
doth
not
obey
his
laws
,
he
causeth
to
be
destroyed
;
ad
whosoever
doth
rebel
against
him
,
he
will
send
his
armies
wainst
them
to
war
,
and
if
he
can
,
he
will
destroy
them
:
and
tus
an
unrighteous
king
doth
pervert
the
ways
ofall
righteousness
.
And
now
behold
[
say
unto
you
,
It
is
not
expediat
that
such
abominations
should
come
upon
you
;
therefore
choose
you
by
the
voice
of
this
people
,
judges
,
that
ye
may
be
judged
according
to
the
laws
which
hath
been
given
you
by
our
fathers
,
which
are
correct
,
and
which
was
giver
them
bv
the
hand
of
the
Lerd
.
Now
it
is
not
common
.
that
the
wive
of
the
people
desireth
any
thing
contrary
to
that
which
istight
;
but
it
is
common
for
the
lesser
part
of
the
people
to
desire
that
which
is
not
right
;
therefore
this
shall
ye
observe
,
aul
make
it
your
law
to
do
your
business
by
the
voice
of
the
people
.
And
if
the
time
cometh
that
the
voice
of
the
people
doth
choose
iniquity
,
then
is
the
time
that
the
judgments
of
God
will
come
upon
you
;
yca
,
then
is
the
time
he
will
visit
you
with
great
destructions
cven
as
he
hath
hitherto
visited
this
lend
.
And
now
if
ye
have
judges
,
and
they
do
not
judge
you
according
to
the
law
which
has
been
given
,
ye
can
cause
.
that
thoy
may
be
judged
of
a
higher
judge
;
if
your
higher
judges
doth
not
judge
righicous
judzments
,
ye
shall
cause
that
asmall
number
of
your
lower
judges
should
be
gathered
together
,
and
they
shall
judge
your
higher
judges
,
according
to
the
voice
of
the
people
,
And
I
command
you
to
do
these
things
in
the
fear
of
the
Lord
;
and
I
command
you
to
do
these
things
,
and
that
ye
have
no
king
:
that
if
these
people
commit
uns
and
iniquities
,
they
shall
be
answered
upon
their
own
ds
.
For
behold
I
say
unto
you
,
The
sins
of
many
people
lave
been
caused
by
the
iniquities
of
their
kings
;
therefore
theiy
iniquities
are
answered
upon
the
heads
of
their
kings
.
And
now
I
desire
that
.
this
inequality
should
be
no
more
in
this
land
,
especially
among
this
my
people
;
but
1
desire
that
his
land
be
a
land
of
liberty
,
and
every
man
may
enjoy
his
ghis
aud
privileges
alike
,
so
long
as
the
Lord
seeth
fit
,
that
We
may
live
and
inherit
the
land
;
yea
,
even
as
long
as
any
of
Sur
posterity
remaineth
upon
the

And
many
More
things
did
king
Mosiah
write
unto

he

telling
them
that

that

expressly
repugnant
to
the
commandments
of
God
,
And
now
it
came
to

,
after
king
Mosiah
hat
sent
thea
things
forth
among
the
people
,
they
were
convinced
of
th
truth
of
his
words
;
therefore
they
relinquished
their

for
a

,
and
became
exceedingly
anxious
that
every

should
have
an
equal
chance
throughout
all
the
Jand
;
ym
and
every
man
expressed
a
willingness
to
answer
for
his
ov
sins
.
Therefore
it
came
to
pass
that
they
assembled
then
.
selves
together
in
bodies
throughout
the
land
,
to
cast
in
the
voices
concerning
who
should
be
their
judges
,
to
judge
then
according
to
the

which
had
been

them
;
and
thy
were
exceedingly
rejoiced

because
of

liberty
which
lal
been
granted
unto
them
.
And
they
did
wax
strong
inky
towards
Mosiah
;
yea
,
they
did
esteem
him
more
than
ay
other
man
:
for
they
did
not
look
upon
him
as
a
tyrant
,
wie
was
seeking
for
gain
,
yea
,
for
that
lucre
which
doth
com
the
soul
,
for
he
had
not
exacted
riches
of
them
,
neither
hil
he
delighted
in
the
shedding
of
blood
;
but
he
bad
establishel

m
the

,
and
he
had
granted
unto
his
people
tli
they
should
be
delivered
fyom
all
manner
of
bondage
;
thee
fore
they
did
esteem
him
,
yea
,
exceedingly
,
beyond
measure
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
appoint
judges
to
rule
ow
them
,
or
to
judge
them
according
to
the
law
;
and
this
th
done
throughout
all
the
land
.
And
it
came
to

that
Alma

appointed
to
be

he
being
also
the

that

he
did

there

And
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
going
to
preach
to
those
wp
believed
on
his
word
,
he
met
a
man
which
belonged
to
ty

yea
,
even
one
of

;
and
he
deem

that
he
might

;
but
the
man
withstood
him
,
admonishiy
him
with
the
words
of
God
.
Now
the
name
of
the
mang
Gideon
;
and
it
was
him
that
was
an
instrument
in
the
hap
of
God
,
in
delivering
the
people
of
Jimhi
out
of

Now
because
Gideon
withstood
hii
with
the
words
of
Gi
he
was
wroth
with
Gideon
,
and
drew
his
sword
and
began
s
smite
him
.
Now
Gideon
being
stricken
with
many
juy
therefore
he
was
not
able
to
withstand
his
blows
,
therefor
:
was
slain
by
ihe
sword
;
and
the
man
who
slew
him
wask
ken
by
the
people
of
the
church
,
and
was
brought
befow
sp
ma
,
to
be
judged
according
to
the
crime
which
he
had
em
mitied
.
And
it
came
te
pass
that
he
stood
before
Alnaal
plead
for
himself
with
much
boldness
.
But
Alma
.
said
me
him
,
Behold
,
this
is
the
first
time
that
priesteraft
has
heenis
troduced
among
this
people
,
And
behold
,
thou
art
not
om
guilty
of
priesteraft
,
but
hast
endeavored
to
enforce
it
byle
sword
;
and
were
priestcraft
to
be
enforced
amoug
this
pe
ple
,
it
would
prove
their
entire
destruction
.
And
thou
li
shed
the
blood
of
a
righteous
man
,
yea
,
a
man
which
has
di
much
good
among
this
people
;
and
were
we
to
spare
the
his
blood
would
come
upon
us
for
vengeance
;
therefore
da
art
condemned
,
to
die
,
according
to
the
law
which
has
ba
given
as
by
Mosiali
,
our
last
king
;
and
they
hare
been
knowledged
by
this
people
;
therefore
this
people
must
abit
by
the
law
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
(
ook
him
;
and
his
namewe
Nehor
;
and
they
carried
him
upon
the
top
of
the
bith
Mat
and
there
he
was
caused
,
or
rather
did
acknowledge
,
etna
the
heavens
and
the
earth
,
that
what
he
had
tang]
[File:227]
m
ignominious
death
.
Nevertheless
this
did
not
put
an
end
to
the
spreading
of
priesteraft
through
the
land
:
for
there
was
many
which
loved
the
vain
things
of
the
world
,
and
they
went
forth
preaching
false
doctrines
;
and
this
they
did
for
the
sake
of
riches
and
honor
.
Nevertheless
they
durst
not
he
,
if
it
were
known
,
for
fear
of
the
law
,
for
liars
were
punished
;
therefore
they
pretended
to
preach
according
@
:
belie
and
now
the
law
could
have
nopower
on
any
Mfan
for
their
telief
.
And
they
durst
not
steal
,
for
fear
of
the
law
;
for
such
were
punished
;
ncithcr
durst
they
rob
,
nor
murder
:
for
he
that
murdered
was
punished
unto
death
.
nal
But
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
did
not
belong
to
the
Church
of
God
,
began
to
persecute
those
that
did
belong
to
the
Church
of
God
,
and
had
taken
upon
them
the
name
of
Christ
;
yea
,
they
did
persecute
them
,
and
afflict
them
with
al
manuer
of
words
,
and
this
because
of
their
humility
;
be
cause
they
were
not
proud
in
their
own
eyes
,
and
because
they
did
impart
the
word
of
God
,
oue
with
another
,
without
money
and
without
price
.
Now
there
was
a
strict
law
among
the
people
ofthe
Church
,
that
there
should
not
any
man
,
belonging
to
the
Church
,
arise
and
persecute
those
that
did
not
belong
to
the
Church
,
and
that
there
should
be
no
persecution
among
themsives
,
Nevertheless
,
there
were
many
ainong
them
who
be~
gn
to
be
proud
,
anil
began
to
contend
warmly
,
with
their
adversaries
,
even
unto
blowsy
yea
,
they
would
smite
one
another
with
their
fists
.
Now
this
was
in
the
second
year
of
the
rign
of
Alma
,
and
it
was
a
cause
of
much
affliction
to
the
Charch
;
yea
,
it
was
the
cause
of
much
trial
with
die
Church
;
for
the
hearts
of
many
were
hardened
,
and
their
names
were
tlotted
out
,
that
they
were
remembered
no'
more
amongsthe
people
of
God
.
And
also
many
withdrew
themselves
trom
tong
them
.
Now
this
was
a
great
trial
to
those
thet
dif
sand
fast
in
the
faith
;
nevertheless
,
they
were
sleadiast
and
inmoyeable
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
they
fore
with
paticnce
the
persecution
,
which
was
heaped
upon
}
them
.
And
now
when
the
priests
left
their
labor
,
to
impart
the
word
of
God
unto
the
people
,
the
people
also
left
their
ly'
bors
to
hear
the
word
of

they

;
and
they
dig
not
wear
costly
apparel
,
yet
they
were
neat
and
comely
:
and
thus
they
did
establish
the
aflairs
of
the
Church
:
and
thy
they
began
to
have
continual

,

And
now
because

ni

having

,

aij

And
thus
in
their

circumstances
they
did
voi
send
away
any
which
was
naked
,

that
was
hungry
,
or
that

or
that

,
@
that

;
and
they
did
not

taerefore
they
were

both

both
male

Church
,
haying
no

to
persons
as
to
these
who
stood
in

;
and
thus
they
did
prosper
aud
become
far
more
wealthy
,
than
those
who
did
not
belong
to
their
Church
,
_
Por
those
who
did
not
belong
to
their
Chureh
,
did
indulge
themselves
in
sorceries
,
and
in
idolatry
or
idleness
and
in
bablings
,
and
in
envyings
and
strife
;
wearing
costly
ap
parel
;
being
hitted
up
in
the
pride
of
ther
own
eyes
;
lying
thieving
,
robbing
,
commiting
whoredoms
,
and
murdering
,
and
ali
manner
of
wickedness
;
nevertheless
,
the
law
was
put
in
force
upon
all
those
who
did
transgress
it
,
inasmuch
as
#
were
possible
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
by
thus
exercising
the
law
upon
them
,
cver¥oman
sufleriug
according
to
that
which
he
ha
done
,
they
became
more
still
,
and
durst
not
commit
any
wick
edness
,
if
it
were
known
;
therefore
,
there
was
much
peace
among
the
people
of
Nephi
,
until
the
fifth
year
of
the
reign
ob
,
the
judges
,
And
it
came
to
pass
im
the
commencement
of
the
fth
year
of
their
reign
,
there
began
to
be
a
contention
among
the
people
,
for
a
certain
man
,
bemg
called
Amlici
;
he
being
&
very
cunning
man
,
yea
,
a
wise
man
,
as
to
the
wisdom
of
the
world
;
he
being
after
ihe
order
ofthe
man
that
slew
Gideon
by
the
sword
,
who
was
executed
according
to
the
Jaw
.
Now”
this
Amlici
had
,
by
his
cumming
,
drawn
away
much
people
af
er
him
;
even
so
much
that
they
begen
to
be
yery
poweiful
and
they
began
to
endeavor
to
establish
Atlici
to
be
a
king”
[File:229]
over
the
people
.
Now
this
was
alarming
to
the
people
of
the
Church
,
and
also
to
all
those
who
had
not
been
drawn
away
afer
the
persuasions
of
Amlici
:
for
they
knew
that
according
o
their
law
that
such
things
must
be
established
by
the
voice
of
the
people
;
therefore
,
if
it
were
possible
that
Amlici
should
gin
the
yoice
of
the
people
,
he
being
a
wicke
nan
,
would
deprive
them
of
their
rights
and
privileges
of
re
,
&e
:
for
it
was
his
intent
to
destroy
the
Church
of
F
g
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
assembled
themselves
together
throughout
all
the
land
,
every
man
according
to
his
niod
,
whether
it
were
for
or
against
Amlici
,
in
separate
bodie
having
much
dispute
and
wonderful
contentions
one
with
nother
;
and
thus
they
did
assemble
themselves
together
,
to
ct
in
their
voices
concerning
the
matter
:
and
they
were
laid
lore
the
judges
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
pople
came
against
Amlici
,
that
he
was
not
made
king
over
the
people
.
Now
this
did
cause
much
joy
in
the
hearts
of
hose
which
were
against
him
;
but
Amlici
did
stir
up
those
whieh
were
in
his
favor
,
to
anger
against
those
which
were
not
this
favor
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
gathered
themselves
together
,
ind
did
consecrate
Amlici
to
be
their
king
.
Now
when
Amlitiwas
made
king
over
them
,
he
commanded
them
that
they
ould
take
up
arms
against
their
brethren
3
und
this
he
done
,
bathe
might
subject
them
to
him
.
Now
the
people
of
Amlici
were
distinguished
by
the
name
of
Amlici
,
being
called
Amlities
;
and
the
remainder
were
called
Nephites
,
or
the
people
God
;
therefore
the
people
of
the
Nephites
was
aware
of
he
intent
of
the
Amlicites
,
and
therefore
they
did
prepare
for
mect
them
;
yea
,
they
did
arm
themselves
with
swords
,
and
Wh
cimeters
,
and
wiih
bows
,
and
with
arrows
,
and
with
tones
,
and
with
slings
,
and
with
all
manner
of
weapons
of
fit
of
every
kind
;
and
thus
they
were
prepared
to
meet
the
licites
at
the
time
of
their
commng
,
And
there
was
appoint
ptains
,
and
higher
captains
,
and
chief
captams
,
according
leit
numbers
.
And
it
cime
to
pass
that
Amlici
did
arm
his
men
with
all
dner
of
weapons
of
war
,
of
every
kind
;
and
he
also
apMitel
rulers
and
leaders
over
his
people
,
to
lead
them
ie
.
@eainst
their
brethren
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
AmMes
came
up
upon
the
hill
Amnihu
,
which
was
eust
of
the
at
Pidon
,
which
ran
hy
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
ihere
Ee
ein
to
make
war
with
the
Nephites
.
Now
Alma
,
he
[File:230]
peing
the
chief
judge
,
and
the
governor
of
the
people
of
Nephi
,
therefore
he
went
up
with
his
people
,
yea
,
with
his
captays
and
chief
captains
,
yea
,
at
the
head
of
bis
armies
,
against
the
Amlicites
to
battle
;
and
they
began
to
slay
the
Aunlicites
up
the
hill
east
of
Sidom
.
And
the
Amlicites
did
contend
with
ile
Nephites
with
great
strength
,
insomuch
that
many
of
the
Ne
phites
did
before
the
Amlicites
;
nevertheless
the
Loy
did
strengiMel
the
hand
of
the
Nephites
,
that
they
slew
the
Amlicites
with
agreat
slaughter
,
that
they
began
to
flee
below
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
did
pursue
the
Amlicites
all
that
day
,
and
did
slay
them
with
much
slaughitey
,
insomuch
that
there
was
slain
of
the
Amlicites
twelve
thousand
five
hundred
thirty
and
two
souls
;
and
there
was
slain
of
ile
Nephites
,
six
thousand
five
hundred
sixty
and
two
souls
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Alma
could
pursue
the
4m
Jicites
no
longer
,
he
caused
that
his
people
should
pitch
tha
tents
in
the
valley
of
Gideon
,
the
valley
bemg
called
after
the
Gideon
which
was
slain
by
the
hand
of
Nehor
with
the
sword
;
and
in
this
valley
the
Nephites
did'
pitch
their
tents
for
te
night
.
And
Alma
sent
spies
to
follow
the
remnant
of
the
An
licites
,
that
he
might
know
of
their
plans
and
their
plots
,
whee
by
he
might
guard
bimself
against
them
,
that
he
might
pe
serve
his
people
from
being
destroyed
.
Now
those
whichk
had
sent
out
to
watch
the
cemp
of
the
Ambcites
,
were
cil
Zeram
,
and
Amnor
,
and
Manti
,
and
Limber
;
these
were
thy
which
went
out
with
their
men
to
watch
the
camp
of
the
An
hieites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
they
returned
inlo
the
camp
of
the
Nephites
,
in
great
haste
,
being
greatly
ast
ished
,
and
struck
with
much
fear
,
saying
,
Behold
,
we
follows
the
camp
of
the
Amlicites
,
and
to
our
great
astonishment
,
i
the
Jand
of
Minon
,
above
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
m
the
cours
of
the
land
of
Nephi
,
we
saw
a
numerous
host
of
the
Lum
iles
;
and
behold
,
the
Amlicites
have
joined
them
,
and
they
upon
our
brethren
in
that
Jand
;
and
they
are
fleeing
Deli
tem
with
their
flocks
,
and
their
wives
,
and
their
childrt
,
towards
our
city
;
ead
except
we
make
haste
,
they
obtain
p®
aession
of
our
city
;
and
our
fathers
,
and
our
wives
,
and
ott
children
be
slain
.
'
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
Nephi
took
thet
tents
,
and
departed
out
of
the
valley
of
Gideon
towards
thet
city
,
which
was
the
city
of
Zorahemla
.
And
hehold
,
2
thet
were
crossing
the
river
Sidon
,
the
Lamanites
and
the
Amici
[File:231]
heing
as
humerous
almost
,
as
it
were
,
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
,
came
upon
them
to
destroy
them
;
nevertheless
the
Nephites
,
being
strengthened
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
haying
prayed
mighiily
to
him
that
he
would
deliver
them
out
of
the
hands
of
thew
enemies
;
therefore
the
Lord
did
hear
their
cries
,
and
did
strengthen
them
,
and
the
Lamanites
and
the
Anulicites
did
fall
before
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
A]
fought
with
Awlici
with
the
sword
,
face
to
face
;
and
t
ey
did
contend
mightily
,
one
with
another
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
,
he
being
a
man
of
God
,
be~
ing
exercised
with
much
faith
,
and
he
cried
,
saying
,
O
Lord
,
haye
mercy
and
spare
my
life
,
that
I
may
be
an
jnsirument
in
thy
hands
,
to
save
and_
preserve
this
people
.
Now
when
Alnahad
seid
these
words
,
he
contended
again
with
Amlici
;
and
he
was
strengthened
,
insomuch
that
he
slew
Amlici
with
the
sword
.
And
he
aiso
contended
with
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
;
but
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
fled
haek
from
before
Alma
,
and
sent
bis
guards
to
contend
with
Alma
.
But
Alma
,
with
his
guards
,
contended
with
the
guards
of
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
,
until
he
slew
and
droye
them
back
;
and
thus
he
cared
the
ground
,
or
rather
the
bank
,
which
was
on
the
west
di
the
riyer
Sidon
,
throwing
the
bodies
of
the
Lamanites
which
lad
been
slain
,
into
the
waters
of
Sidon
,
that
thereby
his
peojle
might
have
room
to
cross
and
contend
with
the
Lamanites
and
the
Amlicites
,
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
Sidon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
all
crossed
the
rive
Sidon
,
that
the
Lamanites
and
the
Amlicites
began
to
flee
before
them
,
notwithstanding
they
were
so
numerous
that
they
could
not
be
numbered
;
and
they
fled
before
the
Nephites
,
lowards
the
wilderness
which
was
west
and
north
,
away
bejod
the
borders
of
the
land
;
and
the
Nephites
did
pursue
then
with
their
might
,
and
did
slay
them
;
yea
,
they
were
met
ot
every
hand
,
and
slain
,
and
driven
,
until
they
were
scattered
tihe
West
,
and
on
the
north
,
until
they
had
reached
the
wil
tess
,
which
was
called
Hermounts
;
and
it
was
that
part
athe
wilderness
which
was
infested
by
wild
and
rayenoug
ists
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
many
died
in
the
wilderness
of
their
wounds
,
and
were
devoured
hy
these
beasts
,
and
also
vultures
of
the
air
;
and
their
bones
have
been
found
,
and
¥
been
heaped
upon
the
earth
.
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
,
which
were
not
slain
the
weapons
of
war
,
after
having
buried
those
which
had
menslain
:
now
the
number
of
the
slain
Were
not
.
numbered
,
i
[File:232]
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
number
;
and
after
they
had
finished
burying
their
dead
,
they
all
returned
to
their
lands
and
to
their
houses
,
and
their
wives
,
and
their
children
,
No
many
women
and
children
had
been
slain
with
the
sword
,
anj
also
many
of
their
flocks
and
their
herds
;
and
also
many
their
fields
of
gram
were
destroyed
,
for
they
were
trodd
down
by
the
sof
men
.
And
now
as
many
of
the
Li
Utes
and
the
Afnlicites
which
had
been
slain
upon
the
bank
9
the
river
Sidon
,
were
cast
into
the
waters
of
Sidon
;
and
behold
their
bones
are
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
,
and
they
are
many
—
And
the
Amlicites
were
distinguished
from
the
Nephites
,
they
had
marked
themselves
with
red
in
their
forcheads
,
ally
the
manner
of
the
Lamanites
;
nevertheless
they
had
not
shon
their
heads
like
unto
the
Lamanites
.
Now
the
heads
of
i
Lamanites
were
shorn
;
and
they
were
naked
,
save
it
wen
skin
,
which
was
girded
ahout
their
loins
,
and
also
their
a
mour
,
which
was
girded
about
them
,
and
their
bows
,
and
the
arrows
,
and
their
stones
,
and
their
slings
,
&e
.
And
the
skit
of
the
Lamanites
were
dark
,
according
to
the
mark
which
wa
set
upon
their
fathers
,
which
was
a
curse
upon
them
becang
of
their
transgression
and
their
rebellion
against
their
brethra
,
which
consisted
of
Nephi
,
Jacob
,
and
Joseph
,
and
Sam
,
whd
were
just
and
holy
men
.
And
their
brethren
sought
to
de
troy
them
;
therefore
they
were
cursed
;
and
the
Lord
Gods
a
mark
upon
them
,
yea
,
upon
Laman
and
Lemuel
,
and
a
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
and
the
Ismaelitish
women
:
and
this
wa
done
,
that
their
seed
might
be
distinguished
from
the
seed
!
their
brethren
,
that
thereby
the
Lord
God
might
preserve
le
people
,
that
they
might
not
mix
and
believe
in
incorrect
tat
tions
,
which
would
prove
their
destruction
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
did
mingle
his
seed
wit
that
of
the
Lamanites
,
did
bring
the
same
curse
upon
his
seel}
therefore
whomsoever
suffered
himself
to
te
led
away
by
Lamanites
,
were
called
under
that
head
,
and
there
was
a
mil
set
upon
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
would
ail
helieve
in
the
tradition
of
the
Lamanites
,
but
believed
thot
records
which
were
brought
out
.
of
the
Jand
of
Jerusalem

;
yea
,
they
set
ithe
mark
upon
themselves
,
yea
,
even
a
mark
of
red
upon
their
foreheads
,
Thus
the
word
of
God
is
fulfilled
,
for
these
are
the
words
which
he
saith
to
Nephi
:
Behold
,
the
Lamanites
have
I
cursed
;
and
I
will
set
a
mark
upon
them
,
that
they
-
and
their
seed
may
be
separated
from
thee
and
thy
seed
,
from
this
time
henceforth
and
forever
,
except
they
repent
of
their
wiekedness
and
turn
to
me
,
that
T
may
faye
mercy
upon
them
.
And
again
:
I
will
set
@
mark
won
him
that
mingleth
his
seed
with
thy
brethren
,
that
they
may
be
cursed
also
.
And
again
:
I
will
sct
a
mark
upon
him
that
fighteth
against
thee
and
thy
seed
.
And
again
J
say
,
He
that
departeth
from
thee
,
shall
no
more
be
called
thy
seed
;
ad
I
will
bless
thee
,
&c
.
and
whomsoever
shail
be
called
thy
seed
,
henceforth
and
forever
:
and
these
were
the
promises
of
the
Lord
unto
Nephi
,
and
to
his
seed
.
Now
the
Amlicites
knew
not
that
they
were
fulfilling
the
words
of
God
,
when
tey
began
to
mark
themselves
in
their
foreheads

hevertheless
they
had
come
out
in
open
rebellion
against
God
;
thorefoeit
was
expedient
that
the
curse
should
fall
upon
them
.—
,
Now
1
would
that
ye
should
see
that
they
brought
upon
themselves
the
curse
;
and
even
so
doth
every
man
that
is
cursed
,
bing
upon
himself
his
own
condemnation
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
not
many
days
after
the
battle
which
was
fought
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
by
the
Lamanites
.
ard
the
Amlicites
,
that
there
was
another
army
of
the
Lamanls
came
in
upon
the
people
of
Nephi
,
in
the
same
place
Whore
the
first
army
met
the
Amlicites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
an
army
sent
.
fo
drive
them
out
of
their
land

Now
Alma
himself
being
alllicted
with
a
wound
,
did
not
go
up
yhattle
at
this
time
against
the
Lamanites
;
but
he
sent
up
a
timerous
army
against
(
hem
;
and
they
went
up
and
slew
matof
the
Lamanites
,
and
drove
the
remainder
of
them
out
of
hehordens
of
their

;
and
then
they
returned
again
,

to

Now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of

Judges
over

people
of

,
there
was
no
contention
nor

in

;
and
the
people
being

greatly
afflicted
for
the
loss
of
their
brethren
,
and
a
so
for
the
loss
of
their
flocks
and
herds
,
and
also
for
the
los
of
their
fields
of
grain
,
which
was
trodden
under

and
de
troyed
by
the
Lamanites
,
and
so
great
was
their
afiliction
,
thut
every
soul
had
causc
to
mourn
;
and
they
believed
the
at
was
the
judgments
of
God
sent
upon
them
,
because
of
ther
wickedness
and
their
abominations
;
therefore
they
were
a
ened
to
a
remembrance
of
their
duty
.
And
they
began
establish
the
church
more
fully
;
yea
,
and
many
were
baptizl
in
the
waters
of
Sidon
,
and
were
joincd
to
the
church
of
Gat
yea
,
they
were
baptized
by
the
hand
of
Alma
,
who
had
consecrated
the
high
priest
over
the
people
of
the
church
,
f
the
hand
of
his
father
Alma
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
te
Judges
,
there
was
about
three
thousand
five
hundred
sa
that
united
themselves
to

,
and
were

And
thus
ended
the
scventh
year
of
the
reign
of
fhe
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
;
and
there
was
continil
peace
in
all
that
time
,
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
cighth
year
of
the
reign
of
tit
Judes
,
that
the
people
of
the
church
began
to
wax
proud
,

of
their
excceding
riches
,
and
their
fine
silks
,
and
thet
fins

because
of
their
many

and
their
gold
,
and
their

,
and
all
manner
of

things
,
which
they
had

by

and
ind
these
things
were
they
lifted
up
in
the
pride
.
of
their
eyes
they
began
to
wear
very
costly
apparel
.
Now
this
was
fh
cause
of
much
affliction
to
Alma
,
yea
,
and
to
many
of
the
ple
which
Alma
had
consecrated
to
he
teachers
,
and
pri
and
elders
,
over
the
church
;
yea
,
many
of
them
were
®
grieved
for
the
wickedness
which
they
saw
had
begun
(
@
ahong
their
people
,
For
they
saw
and
beheld
with
great
[File:235]
sow
,
that
the
people
of
the
church
began
to
be
lifed
up
in
the
pride
of
their
eyes
,
and
to
set
their
hearts
upon
riches
and
upon
the
vain
things
of
the
world
;
that
they
began
to
be
scornful
,
one
towards
another
,
and
they
began
to
persecute
those
that
did
not
believe
according
to
their
own
will
and
pleasure
.
And
thus
in
this
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
,
there
began
fo
be
great
contentions
among
the
people
of
the
church
;
yea
,
there
was
envyings
,
and
strif'
,
and
malice
,
and
persecutions
,
ond
pride
,
even
to
exceed
the
pride
of
tiose
who
did
not
belong
to
the
church
of
God
.
And
thus
ended
the
eighth
year
ofthe
reign
of
the
Judges
;
and
the
wickedness
of
the
ehurch
was
a
great
stumbling
block
to
those
who
.
did
not
belong
to
the
church
;
and
thus
the
church
began
to
fail
in
its
progress
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
ninth
year
,
Alma
seeing
the
wickedness
of
the
church
,
and
sceing
also
that
the
example
of
the
church
began
to
lead
those
who
were
unbelievers
,
on
from
one
piece
of
iniquity
to
another
,
this
bringing
on
the
destruction
of
the
people
;
yea
,
sceing
great
mequality
among
the
people
,
some
lifiiug
themselves
up
with

pride
,
despising
others
,
turning
their
backs
upon
the
needy
,
and
the
naked
,
and
those
which
were
hungry
,
and
those
which
were
athirst
,
and
those
which
were
sick
and
afflicted
.
Now
this
was
a
great
cause
for
lamentations
among
the
peoJk
,
while
others
were
abasing
themselyes
,
succoring
those
who
stood
in

as
imparting
their

and

ulering
all
manner
of
afflictions
,
for
Christ's
sake
,
which
should
come
according

looking

And
he

Bebold

he

sleep
,
and
they
awoke
unto

Behold
,
they
yere
in

midst
of
darkness
;
nevertheless
,
their
souls
were
illuminated
by
the
light
of
the
everlasting
word
;
yea
,
they
were
encircled
about
by
the
bands
of
death

in
the
words
which
was
delivered
by
the
mouth
of
Abinadi
?
And
was
he
not
a
holy
prophet
?
Did
be
not

the
word'of
God

and
my

Alma
believe
them

And
according

,
and

,
Lord
,
Qyp
works
have
been

and

Or

,
can

yourselves
brought
before
the
tribunal
of
God
,
with
your
souls
.
filled
with
guilt
and

;
having
a

;
yea
,
a
perfect
remembrance
of

,
yea
,
a

that
ye

Jsay
unto
you
,
can
ye
look
up
to
God
g
that
day
with
a
pure
heart
and
clean
hands
?
I
say
unto
you
,
can
you
look
up
,
having
the
image
of
God
engraven
upon
youp
countenances
?
I
say
unto
you
,
can
ye
think
of
being
saved
when
you
have
yielded
yourselves
to
become
subjects
to
the
Devil
?
I
say
unto
you
,
ye
will
know
at
that
day
,
that
ye
can
.
not
be
saved
:
for
there
can
no
man
be
saved
except
his
gap
ments
are
washed
white
;
yea
,
his
garments
must
be
purified
until
they
are
cleansed
from
all
stain
,
through
the
blood
of
hin
of
whom
it
hath
been
spoken
by
our
fathers
which
should
come
to
redeem
his
people
from
their
sins
.
And
now
F
ask
of
you
,
my
brethren
,
how
will
any
of
you
fecl
,
if
ye
shall
stand
betore
the
bar
of
God
,
having
your
garments
stained
with
blood
,
and
ali
manner
of
filthiness
?
Behold
,
what
will
thew
things
testify
against
you
?
Behold
,
will
they
not
testify
that
Ye
are
murderers
,
yea
,
and
also
that
ye
are
guilty
of
all
man
ner
of
wickedness
?
Behold
,
my
brethren
,
do
ye
suppose
thal
such
an
one
can
have
a
place
to
sit
down
in
the
Kingtom
of
God
,
with
Abraham
,
with
Isaac
,
and
with
Jacob
,
and
also
all
.
the
holy
prophets
,
whose
garments
are
cleansed
,
and
arc
spot
less
,
pure
and
white
?
Tsay
unto
you
,
nay
,
except
yo
make
our
creator
a
liar
from
the
beginning
,
or
suppose
that
he
is
liar
from
the
beginning
;
or
also
,
ye
cannot
suppose
that
such
an
one
can
have
place
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
,
but
they
shall
be
cast
out
,
for
they
are
the
children
of
the
kingdom
of
the
Devil
,
And
now
behold
,
1
say
unto
you
,
my
brethren
,
if
ye
have
experienced
a
change
of
heart
,
and
if
ye
have
felt
to
sing
the
song
of
redeeming
love
,
T
would
ask
,
cin
ve
feel
so
now
?
ELave

,
Keeping
yourselves
blameless
bch
Could

,
if

at
this
time
,
witli

that

That

,
through
the
blaa
of
Christ
,
which
will
come
to

dis
people
from

?
Behold
,
are
ye
stripped
of
pride
?
Isay
unto
you
,
if
ye
are
not
,
ye
are
nol
prepared
to
meet
God
.
Behold
,
ye
must
prepare
quickly
,
for
the
kingdom
of
Heaven
is
soon
at
hand
,
and
such
an
one
hath
not

Behold
,
I
say
,
is
there
one
among
you
who
is
not
stripped
of
envy
?
[say
unto
you
,
that
such
an

and
I
would
that
he
should
prepare
quickly
,
for
the
hour
is
close
at
hand
,
and
he
inoweth
not
when
the
time
shall
come
:
for
such
an
one
is
not
found
guiltless
,
And
again
I
say
unto
you
,
is
there
one
among
you
that
doth
make
a
mock
of
his
brother
,
or
that
heapeth
upon

persecutions
?
Wo
unto
such
an
one
,
for
he
is
not
prepared
,
and
the
time
is
at
hand
that
he
must
repent
,
or
he
cannot
be
saved
;
yea
,
even
wo
unto
all
ye
workers
of
iniquity
;
repent
,
repent
,
for
the
Lord
God
hath
spoken
it
.
Behold
,
he
sindeth
an
invitation
unlo
all
men
;
for
the
arms
of
mercy
is
extended
towards
them
,
and
he
saith
,
Repent
,
and
I
will
receive
you
;
yea
,
he
saith
,
Come
unto
me
and
ye
shall
partake
ofthe
fruit
of

yea
,
ye

;
yea
,
come
unto
mc
and
bring

of
righteousness
,
and
ye
shall
not
be
heivn
down
and
cast
into

fire
:
for
behold
,
the
time
is
at
tund
that
whosoever
bringeth
-
forth
not
good
fruit
,
or
whosoever
doeth
not
the
works
of
righteousness
,
the
same
hath
cause
towail
and
mourn
,
O
ye
workers
of
iniquity
;
ye
that
are
.
puffed
up
in
the
vain
things
of
the
world
;
ye
that
have
professed
to
have
known
the
ways
of
rightcousness
;
nevertheless
ye
have
gone
astray
,
as
sheep
having
no
shepherd
,
notwithstanding
a
shepherd
hath
called
after
you
,
and
art
still
calling
after
you
,
but
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
his
voice
.
Behold
,
f
say
unto
you
,
that
the
good
shepherd
doth
call
you
;
yea
,
and
in
his
own
name
he
doth
call
you
,
which
is
the
name
of
Christ
;
and
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
good
shepherd
,
tothe
name
by
:
which
ye
are
called
,
behold
,
ye
are
not
the
sheep
of
the
good
shepherd
.
And
now
if
ye
are
not
the
sheep
ofthe
good
shepherd
,
of
what
fold
are
ye
?
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
the
Devil
is
your
shepherd
,
and
ye
are
of
his
fold
;
and
now
who
can
deny
this
?
Behold
,
1
say
unto
you
,
Whosoever
denieth
this
,
is
a
liar
and
a
child
of
the
Devil
;
for
Say
unto
you
,
that
whatsoever
is
good
,
cometh
from
God
,
and
whatsoever
is
evil
,
cometh
from
the
Devil
;
therefore
,
fa
tn
bringeth
forth
good
works
,
be
hearkeneth
unto
the
voice
the
good
shepherd
,
and
he
doth
follow
him
;
but
whosoever
Aringeth
forth
evil
works
,
the
same
becometh
a
child
of
the
3885
[File:240]
Devil
:
for
he
hearkeneth
unto
his
voice
,
and
doth
follow
And
whosoever
doeth
this
must
receive
his
wages
of
hin
:
therefore
,
for
his
wages
he
receiveth
death
,
as
to
things
pe
taming
unto
tighteousness
,
being
dead
unto
all
good
works
.

CHAPTER
IV
.
Anp
how
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Alma
had
made
ang]
of
speaking
unto
the
people
of
the
church
,
which
was
estgh
Ushed
in
the
city
of
Zarahomlu
,
he
ordamed
priesisand
elder
,
by
laying
on
his
hands
according
to
the
order
of
God
,
ta
pre
side
and
watch
over
the
church
.
And
it
came
to
pass
the
whomsoever
did
not
belong
to
the
church
who
repented
f
ibeir
sins
,
was
baptized
unio
repentance
,
and
was
receiral
into
the
church
.
And
it
also
came
to
pass
that
whomsoers
iid
belong
to
the
church
,
that
did
not
repent
of
their
wickek
ness
,
and
humble
themselves
before
God
;
I
mean
those
whith
were
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
hearts
;
the
same
were
m
jected
,
and
their
names
were
blotted
out
,
that
their
names
Wore
not
numbered
among
those
of
the
righteous
:
and
thu
they
began
to
establish
the
order
of
the
chuych
in
the
city
Zarabemla
.
Now
I
would
that
ye
should
understand
that
the
word
of
God
was
liberal
unto
all
;
that
no
one
was
deprived
of
the
privilege
of
assembling
themselves
together
to
hear
the
word
of
God
;
nevertheless
the

in
fasting
and
mighty
prayer
,
in

of
the
welfare
of
the
souls
of
those
who

And
now
it
came
to

that
when
Alma
had
made

,
he
departed
from
them
,
yea
,
from
the

and
went
over

into

there
having
heen@
city
built
which
was

was
called

,
being
called
after
the
man
which
was
slain
by

hand
of

with

.
And
Alma
went
and
began
to
declare
the
word
of
God
unto
the
church
which
was
established
in
the
valley
of
Gideon
,
according
to
the

had
been

and
according

whieh
was

according

of

Benouy
my

seeing
that
I

been
per
mitied
to
come
unto
you
,
therefore
I
attempt
to
address
you
inmy
language
;
yea
,
by
my
own
mouth
,
secing
that
,
it
is
the
first
time
that
Ihave
spoken
unto
you
by
the
words
of
my
mouth
,
Ehaving
been
wholly
confined
to
the
jndgment
seat
,
having
had
much
business
that
I
could
not
come
unto
you
;
and
even
I
could
not
have
come
now
at
this
time
,
were
it
not
that
the
judgment
seat
hath
been
given
to
another
,
to
reign
in
my
stead
;
and
the
Lord
in
much
mercy
hath
granted
that
1
should
come
unto
you
.
And
behold
,
Ihave
come
,
having
great
hopes
and
much
desire
that
I
should
find
that
ye
had
Oa
bled
yourselves
before
God
,
and
that
ye
had
continued
in
the
supplicating
of
his
grace
,
that
I
should
find
that
ye
were
blameless
before
him
;
that
I
should
find
that
ye
were
not
in
the
awful
dilemma
that
our
brethren
were
in
at
Zarahemla
;
but
blessed
be
the
name

of
God
that
he
hath
given
me
to
know
,
yea
,
hath
given
unto

the
excecding
great
joy
of
knowing
that
they
are

again
in

And]
trust
,
aceording
to
the
spirit
of
God
which
is
in

,
that

also
have
joy
over
you
;
nevertheless
I
do
not
desire
thet
my
joy
over
you
,
should
come
by
the
cause
of
so
much
aff
sions
and
sorrow
which
Ihave
had
for
the
brethren
at

for

Aud
now
my
beloved
brethren
,
do
you
believe
these
things
?
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
yea
,
I
know
that
you
believe
them
;
and
the
way
that
I
know
that
ye
befieve
them
,
is
by
the
manifestation
of
the
spirit
which
is
in
me
.
And
now
because
:
your
faith
is
strong
concerning
that
,
yea
,
concerning
the
things
which
I
have
spoken
,
great
is
my
joy
.
For
as
I
said
unto
you
from
the
beginning
,
that
J
had
much
desire
that
ye
was
not
in
the
state
of
dilemma
like
your
brethrn
,
even
so
I
have
found
that
my
desires
have
been
gratified
.
For
!
perceive
that
ye
ere
in
the
paths
of
righteousness
;
I
perceive
that
ye
are
in
{he
path
which
Jeads
to
the
kingdom
of
God
;
yea
,
I
perceive
that
ye
are
making
his
paths
straight
;
I
parveive
that
it
hath
been
made
known
unto
you
by
the
testinony
of
his
word
,
that
he
cannot
walk
in
crooked
paths
;
wither
doth
he
vary
from
that
which
he
hath
said
;.
neither
hath
he
a
shadow
of
turning
from
the
righi
to
the
lefi
,
er
from
that
which
is
right
to
that
which
is
wrong
;
therefore
,
his
course
is
one
eternal
round
.
And
he
doth
not
dwell

unholy
temples
;
neither
cau
filthinces
,
or
any

which
is
unclean

therefore
I
say
unto
you

the
time
shall
come

yea
,
and
it
shall
be
at
the
last
day
,
that
he
which
is
filthy
,
shall
remain
in
his
filthiness
.

[
have
said
these
things
unfo
you
,
that
I
might
awaken
you
to
a

CHAPTER
VI
.
Any'
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
returned
from
the
ly
of
Gideon
,
after
having
taught
the
people
of
Gideon
things
which
cannot
be
written
,
having
established
the
on
of
the
church
,
according
as
he
had
before
done
in
the
:
land
Zarahemlas
yea
,
he
returned
to
his
own
house
at
Zarah
i
to
rest
himself
from
the
labors
which
he
led
performed
.
df
thus
ended
the
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
J
udges
over
ty
people
of
Nephi
.
ine
i
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
tenth
ta
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
that
Al
departed
from
thence
,
and
took
his
journey
over
into
the
lai
of
Melek
,
on
the
west
of
the
river
Sidon
,
on
the
west
,
by
I
orders
of
the
wilderness
;
aud
he
began
to
teach
the
peop
!
in
the
Jand
of
Melek
,
according
to
the
holy
order
of
Goth
which
be
had
been
calied
;
and
he
began
to
teach
the
peo
throughout
all
the
land
of
Melek
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
came
to
him
throughi
all
the
borders
of
the
land
which
was
by
the
wilderness
4
And
it
ame
to
pass
that
they
were
baptized
through
the
land
,
so
that
when
he
had
finished
hts
work
at
Melek
i
deperted
thence
,
and
travelled
three
days'
journey
-
on
i
north
of
the
land
of
Melek
;
and
he
came
to
a
city
whieh
[File:247]
tilled
Ammonihah
.
Now
it
was
the
custom
6f
the
people
of
Nephi
,
to
call
their
lands
,
and
their
cities
,
and
their
villages
,
yea
,
even
all
their
sinall
villages
,
after
the
name
of
him
who
first
possessed
them
;
and
thus
it
was
with
the
land
of
Anumohihal
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Alma
had
came
tothe
city
of
Ammonihah
,
he
began
to
preach
the
word
of
God
-
unte
them
.
Now
satan
had
got
great
hold
upon
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
the
city
of
Ammonihah
;
therefore
they
would
not
hearken
into
the
words
of
Alma
.
Nevertheless
Alma
Jabored
much
in
the
spirit
,
wrestling
with
God
in
mighty
prayer
,
that
he
would
pour
out
his
spirit
upon
the
people
which
was
in
the
city
;
that
he
would
also
grant
that
he
might
baptize
them
unto
repentmice
;
nevertheless
,
(
hey
hardened
their
hearts
,
Saying
unto
him
,
Behold
,
we
know
that
thou
art
Alma
;
and
we
know
that
thou

High
Priest
over
the
church
which
thou
hast
estabIshed
in
many
parts
of
the
Jand
,
according
to
your
tradition
;
ad
we
are
not
of
thy
church
,
and
we
do
not
believe
in
such
foolish
traditions
.
And
now
we
know
that
because
we
are
notof
thy
church
,
we
know
that
thou
hast
no
power
over
us
;
and
thou
hast
delivered
up
the
judgment
seat
unto
Nepbikah
;
therefore
thou
art
not
the
Chief
Judgeover
us
,
Now
when
the
Pople
had
said
this
,
and
had
withstood
all
his
words
,
and
rewed
him
,
and
spit
upon
:
him
,
and
caused
that
ke
should
he
cast
out
of
their
city
,
he
departed
thence
and
took
his
jourhey
towards
the
city
which
was
called
Aaron
.
_And
it

anguish
of

because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
Mople

And
it
came
to

sorrow

And
it
came

as
I
began
to

unto

they
kefun
to
contend
with
me
,
saying
:
Who
art
thou

Suppose
ye
that
we
shall
believe
the
testimony
of
one
man
,
although
he
should
preach
unto
us
that
the
earth
should

away

Now
they
understood
not
the
words
which
they
spake
,
for
the
knew
not
that
the
earth
should
pass
away
.
And
they
sayel
i

,
We
will
not
believe
thy
words
,
if
thou
shouldst
pro
sy
that
this
great
city
should
be
destroyed
in

No

knew
not
that
God
could
do
such
marvellous
works

Were
a

a

And
they
sayeth

Who

that
sendeth
no
more
authority
than
one
man
among

to
declare
unto
them
the

And
they
stood
forth
to
lay
heirhands
on
ine
;
but
behold
,
they
did
not
.
And
I
stood
with
boldness
to
declare
unto
them
,
yea
,
I
did
boldly
testify
into
them
,
saying
:
Behold

O

he
delivered
our

them

even
by

brethren

,
Yea
,
it
had
not
been
:
for
his

power
,
and
his

merey
,
;
his
long
suffering
towards
us
,
we
should
unayoidably
been
cut
off
from
the
face
of

,
long
before
this
p
of

,
and
perhaps
been
consigned
to
a
state
of
endless
my

Behold
,
now]
say
unto
you
,
that

coma
eth
you
to
repent

ye
can
in
no

But
behold
,
this
is
not

;
hath
commanded
you
to

he
will
utterly
destroy
yun
from

,
he
will
visit

in

will
not

do

ye
not

the
words
which
be
spake
unto

saying
,
That
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandmen
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land

And
again
it
is
said
,
Thaty
much
as
ye
will
not
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
shall
be
off
from
the
presence
of
the

...
Now
I
would
thaty
should
remember
,
that
inasmuch
as
the
Lamanites
haye
mi
kept
the
commandments

of
God
,
they
haye
been
cut
off

Now
we
see
that
the
word

of

hath
been
verified
in
this
thing
,

the
Lamanites
hi
been
cut
off
from

his

from
the
beginning
of
transgressions
in

I
say
unto
you
,
it
shall
be
more
tolerable
for
them
in
the
day
of
judgm
than
for
you
,
if
ye
remain
in
your

for

for

there
are
many
promises
which
is
extended
to

for
it
is
because
of
the
traditions

them
to
remain
in

of
ignorance
;
there
the
Lord
will
be
merciful
unto
them

and
prolong
their
exe

in

And
at
some
period
of
time
they
will

brought
to
believe
in

to
know
of
the
incor

of

the

of

Judges

As
Iwas
a
journeying
to
see
a
very
near
kindred
,
behold
an
angel
of
the
Lord
appeared
unto
me
,
and
said
,
Amulek
,
return
to
thine
own
house
,
for
thou
shalt
feed
a
prophet
of

Lord
;
yea
,
a

which
art
a
chosen
man
of
God
;
for
he
hath
fasted
many
days
because
of
the
sins
of
this
people
,
and
he
is
an
hua

,
and
thou
shall
receive

And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
angel
,
and
returned
towards
my
house
.
And
as
was
a
going
thithtr
,
[found
the
man
which
the
angel
said
unto
me
,
Thou
shalt
meeive
into
thy
house
;
and
behold
it
was
this
same
man
which
hath
been
speaking
unto
you
concerning
the
things
of
God
.—
And
the
angel
said
unto
me
,
He
is
a
holy
man
;
wherefore
I
:
know
he
is
a
holy
man
,
becatise
it
was
said
by
an
angel
of
God
,
And
again
:
I
know
that
the
things
whereof
he
hath
testified
are
true
;
for
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
as
the
Lord
liveth
,
even
so
he
hath
sent
his
angel
to
make
these
things
manifest
unto
me
;
and
this
he
hath
done
while
this
Alma
.
lath
dwelt
at
my
house
;
for
behold
,
he
hath
blessed
mine
house
,
he
hath
blessed
me
,
and
my
women
,
and'
my
children
,
and
my
father
,
and
my
kinsfolks
;
yea
,
even
all
my
kindred
hath
he
blessed
,
and
the
blessing
of
the
Lord
hath
rested
up~
on
ts
according
to
the
words
which
he
spake
.
th
.
And
now
when
Amulek
had
spoken
these
words
,
the
peoPle
began
to
be
astonished
,
seeing
there
was
more
than
one
winess
which
testified
of
the
things
whereof
they
were
accu
-
~
sed
;
and
also
of
the
things
which
was
to
come
,
according
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy
which
wasin
them
;
nevertheless
,
there
Were
some
among
them
which
thought
to
question
them
,
that
their
cunning
devices
they
might
catch
them
in
their
words
,
that
they
might
find
witness
against
them
,
that
they
might
deHer
them
to
the
Judges
,
that
they
might
be
judged
uccording
[File:254]
to
:
the
law
,
and
that
they
:
might
be
slain
or
cast
into
prison
y
eording
to
the
.
crime
which
they
could
make
appear
,
or
Ress
against

Now
it
was
those
men
which

But
Aiaulek
stretched
forth

and
ied
the

unto
them
,
saying
:
O
ye

;
why

got
such
great
hold
upon

Why
will
ye

that

{hat
ye

For
behold

have
I

Ye
donot
understand
;
ye
say
that
I
have
spoken
against

law
;
but
I
have
,
not
;
but
I
have
spoken
in
favor
of

fo
your
condemnation

Andnow
behold

say
unto
you
,
that
ihe

destruction
of

isa

beginniag
to

by
the
unrighteousness
of

and
your

.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Amulek
had
spoken
these
words
,
the
people
cried
out
.
against
him
,
saying
,
Now
ye
know
that
this
man
is
a
child
of
the
Devil
,
for
he
hath
lied
wto
us
;
fer
he
hath
spoken
against

our

And
now
he
saith
that
he
hath
not
spoken
against
it
,
And
again
:
he
hath
wviled
against
our
Lawyers
,
and
our

,
&ce
.
And
it
ame
to
.
pass
that
the
Lawyers
put
it
into
their
hearts
that
they
should
remember
these
things
against
him
.
And
it
came
fopass'
that
there
was
one
among
them
whose
name
was
.
Zerom
:
Now
he
being
the
foremost
to
accusc
Amulek
and
Alina
,
he
being
one
of

among

Now

the

'
oy
Now
it
was
in
-
the
law
of

.
that
every

man
which

of

,
or

should

according
to
the
time
which
they
labered

those
which
were
brought'
before
them
to

\
Now
.
ifa
man
oweth
another
,
and
he
would
not
pay
that
which
he
did
owe
,
he
was
complained
of
to
the
Judge
;
and
_
tle
Judge
executed
authority
,
and
.
sent
forth
officers
that
the
tan
should
be
brought
before
him
;
and
he
judgeth
the
man
eording
to
the
law
and
the
evidences
which
arc
brought
as
fainst
him
;
and
thus
the
man
was
compelled
to
pay
that
which
he
oweth
,
or
be
striped
,
or
be
cast
out
from
among
the
people
,
Sathief
and
arobber
.
And
the
Judge
recieveth
for
his
waSts
according
to
his
time
:
a
scnine
of
gold
for
a
day
,
or
a
-
sehum
of
silver
,
which
,
is
equal
to
.
a
senine
,
of
gold
;
and
.
this
ig
cording
to
the
law
which
was
given
.
Now
these
are
the
[File:256]
names
of
the
different
pieces
of
their
gold
,
and
of
theiy
according
to
their
value
.
And
the
names
are
given
by
@
,
Nephites
;
for
they
did
not
reckon
after
the
manner
of
the
dep
,
which
were
at
Jerasalem
;
neither
did
they
measure
after
manner
of
the
Jews
,
but
they
altered
their
reckoning
and
nieasure
,
according
to
the
ininds
and
the
circumstances
of
fy
people
,.
in
every
generation
,
until
the
reign
of
the
Judgess
th
having
been
established
by
king
Mosiah
,
Now
the
reekonig
is
thus
:
A
senine
of
gold
,
a
seon
of
gold
,
a
shum
of
gold
,
a
lmnah
of
gold
.
A
senum
of
silver
,
an
amnor
of
sily
1
a
ezrom
of
silver
,
and
an
onti
of
silver
.
A
senum
of
silvery
,
equal
to
a
senine
of
gold
;
and
cither
for
a
measure
of
bate
and
also
for
a
mcasure
of
every
kind
of
grain
.
Now
the
mount
of
a
secon
of
gold
,
was
twice
the
value
of
a
senines
a
a
sham
of
gold
was
twice
the
value
of
a
seon
;
and
a
lime
.
of
gold
was
the
value
of
them
all
;
and
an
amnor
of
silvery
as
great
as
two
sepums
;
and
an
ezrom
of
silver
was
as
g
as
four
senums
;
and
an
onti
was
as
great
as
them
all
.
N
this
is
the
value
of
the
lesser
numbers
of
their
reckoning
;
shiblon
is
half
of
asenum
:
therefore
a
shiblon
for
halfam
ure
of
barley
;
and
a
shiblum
is
a
half
of
a
shiblon
;
anda
2h
is
the
half
of
a
shiblum
.
Now
this
is
their
number
,
a
ding
to
their
reckoning
.
Now
an
antion
of
gold
is
three
shublons
.
Now
it
was
for
the
sole
purpose
for
to
get
gain
,
be
they
recieved
wages
according
to
their
employ
;
therefore
did
stir
up
the
people
to
riotings
,
and
all
manner
of
ditt
ces
and
wickedness
,
that
they
might
have
more
employ
;
they
might
get
money
according
to
the
suits
which
was
bro

before
them
;
therefore
they
did
stir
up
the
people
against

Now
Aima

that

Amulek
had

for
he
beheld
that
Amulek
had
eaught
him
in
t
tying
and
deceiving
,
to
destroy
him
,
and
secing
that
he
bere
to
tremble
under
a
consciousness
of
his
guilt
,
he
opened
mouth
and
began
to
,
speak
unto
him
,
and
to
establish

w

of
Amulck
,
and
to
explain
things
beyond

unfold
the
Scriptures
beyond
that
which
Amulek
had
done

Now
t
words
that
Alma
spake
unto
Zeezrom

was
heard
by
the
pe
ple

:
for
the
multitude
was
at
,
and
he
sp
ou
this
wise
:
Now
Zeezrom
;
seeing
that
thou
hast
been
ti
[File:259]
is
thy
lying
and
craftiness
,
for
thou
hast
not
lied
unto/men
only
,
but
thou
hast
lied
unto
God
.
For
behold
,
he
knows
all
thy
thoughts
;
and
thou
scest
that
thy
thoughts
are
made
known
unto
us
by
his
spirit
;
and
thou
seest
that
we
know
thal
thy
plan
was
a
very
subtle
plan
,
as
to
the
subtle
Devil
,
for
to
lie
and
to
deceive
this
people
,
that
tho
set
them
against

revile
us
and
to
cast

was
a
plan
of
thine
adversary
,
and
he
hath
cxercised
his

in
thee

Now
J
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
what
Fsay
unto

I
say
unto

...
And
behold
,
1
say
unto
you
all
,
that
this
was
a
snare
of
the
adversary
,
which
he
hath
hid
to
catch
this
people
,
that
he
might
bring
you
into

unto
him
,
that
he
might
encircle
you

with
his
chains
,
that
he
might
chain
you
down
to
everlasting
degpraction
,
according
to
the
power
of
his
captivity
:
Now
when
Alma
had
spoken
these
words
,
Zeezrom
hegan
istremble
more
exceedingly
,
for
he
was
convinced
more

nore
of

hie
was

convinced

MNmaand
Amuick
had
a
knowledge
of
him
,
fer
he
was
conYnecd
that
they
knew
the
thoughts
and
intents
of
his
heart
:
fr
power
was
given
unto
them
that
they
might
know
of

tran
to

of
them
diligently
,
that
he
might
know
more
Micerniug
the

And
he
saith
unto
Alma
,
What
does
this
mean
which
Amulek
hath
spoken
concerning
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
,
that
all
shull
rise
from

the
just
and
the
unjust
,
and
are
bronght
to
stand
before
God
,
to
be
judged
according
to
their
works
?

And
now
Alma
began
to
expound
these
things
unto
hin
,
saying
,
It
is
given
inte
many
to
know
the
mysteries
of
God
;
nevertheless
they
tre
laid
under
a
strict
command
,
that
they
shall
not

according

the
portion
of
his
word
,
which
he
doth
grant
Unto
the
children
of
men
,
according
to
the
heed
and
diligence
which
they
give
unto
him
;
and
therefore
he
that
will
harden
his
heart
,
the
same
receiveth
the
lesser
portion
of
the
word
;
and
he
that
will
not
harden
his
heart
,
to
him
is
given
the
greater'
rion
of
the
word
,
until
it
is
given
unto
him
to
know
the
tysteries
of
God
,
until
they
know
them
in

;
and
be
that

harden
his

,
to
him
is
given
the
lesser
portion
of

Nord
,
until
they

ond
ten
they
are

Then

in

we

would

we
could
command

to

to

By

And
now
behold
I
say
unto
you
,
then
cometh
a
death
,
eva
a
second
death
,
which
is
a
spiritual

then

shalld
so
die

yea
,
he
shall
die
as
to
things
pertae
ing
upto

then
is
ihe
time'
when
their
tomes
shall
be
as

Jake
of

whose
flames
asvenl
cth
up
forever

ever

and
then
is
the
time
that
they
shall
be
chained
down
to
an
everlasting
destruction
,
according
the
power
and
captivity
of
Satan
;
he
having
subjected
then
according
io
his
will
.
Then
I
say
unto
you
,
they
shall
bes
though
there
bad
been
no
redemption
made
;
for
they
cannathe
redeemed
according
to
God's
justice
;
and
they
cannot
fi
seeing
there
is
no
more
corruption
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Alma
had
made
an
end
speaking
these
words
,
the
people
began
to
be
more
astonished
;
but
there
was
one
Antionah
,
who
was
a
chief
ruler
amom
them
,
come
forth
and
said
unto
him
,
What
is
this
that
tha
hast
said
,
that
man
should
rise
from
the
dead
and
be
.
changel
from
this
mortal
to
an
immortal
state
,
that
the
soul
can
ner
die
?
What
does
this
Scripture
mean
,
which
saith
that
Gol
placed
Cherubims
and
a
flaming
sword
on
the
east
of
the
gt
den
of
Eden
,
lest
our
first
parents
should
enter
and
partaked
!
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life
,
and
live
forever
?
And
thus
see
that
there
was
no
possible
chance
that
they
should
Jive
fer
ever
.
Now
Alma
saith
unto
him
,
This
is
the
thing
whieh
[File:261]
was
about
to
explain
.
Now
we
see
that
Adam
did
fall
by
artaking
of
the
forbidden
fruit
,
according
to
the
word
of
God
;
and
thas
we
see
,
that
by
his
fall
,
that
all
mankind
became
.
a
Jost
and
a
fallen
people
.
And
now
behold
,
I
suy
unto
you
,
that
if
it
had'been
possible
for
Adam
for
to
have
partaken
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life
at
that
time
,
that
there
would
haye
peen
no
death
,
and
the
word
sould
have
been
rohan
Gode
liar
:
for
he
said
,
If
thou
eat
,
thou
shalt
surely
dic
.
And
we
eee
that
death
comes
upon
mankind
,
yea
,
the
death
which
has
been
spoken
of
by
Amulek
,
which
is
the
temporal
death
;
nevertheless
there
was
a
space
granted
unto
man
,
in
which
he
might
repent
;
therefore
this
.
hfe
became
a
probationary
stale
;
a
time
to
prepare
to
meet
God
;
a
time
to
preare
for
that
endless
state
,
which
has
been
spoken
of
by
us
,
which
is
after
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
.
Nowif
it
had
not
teen
for
the
plan
of
redemption
,
which
was
Mid
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
,
there
could
have
heen
no
resurrection
ofthe
dead
;
but
there
was
a
plan
of
redemption
laid
,
whieh
shall
bring
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
,
of
which
has
heen
spoken
.
And
now
behold
,
if
it
were
possible
that
our
first
parents
could
have
went
Jorth
and
partaken
of
the
tree
of
lif
,
they
would
have
been
forever
miserable
,
having
no
prepiratory
state
;
and
thus
the
plan
of
redemption
would
have
teen
frustrated
,
and
the
word
of
God
would
have
been
void
,
taking
none
effect
.
But
behold
,
.
it
was
not
so
;
but
it
was
appointed
unto
man
that
they
must
dic
;
and
after
death
,
they
musi
come
to
judgment
;
even
that
same
judgment
of
which
we
have
spoken
,
which
is
the
end
.
And
after
God
had
appointed
thal
these
things
should
come
unto
man
,
behold
,
then
he
sew
that
it
was
expedient
that
man
should
know
concerning
.
ihe
things
whereof
he
lad
appointed
unto
thems
therefore
he
sent
angels
to
converse
with
them
,
which
caused
inep
to
beheld
of
his
vlory
.
And
they
began
from
.
that
time
forth
to
call
,
an
his
nade
;
therefore
God
conversed
with
men
,
und
nl
unto
them
the
plan
of
redemption
,
which
had
been
rived
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
;
and
this
he
made
known
unto
them
,
according
to
their
faith
and
repentance
,
end
their
holy
works
;
wherefore
he
gave
commancaents
nto
,
men
,
they
having
first
transgressed
the
first
commandments
as
to
things
which
were
temporal
,
and

from

therefore
God
gave
unto

them
commandments

after
having
made
known
unto
themy

,
that
they
should
not

the
thereof

the
order
of
his
Son
,
to

teach
these
things
unto
the
people
;
eud
those
Priests
were
ordeinsd
afer
the
order
of
his
Son
,
in
a
manner
that
thereby
the
per
ple
might
know
in
what
manner
to

,
And
this
is
the
manner
after
which
they
wen
ordained
,
being
called
and

,
with
that
holy
calling
which
was
prepared
with
[File:263]
and
according
to
,
a
preparatory
redemption
for
such
;
and
thus
they
having
been
called
to
this
holy
calling
on
account
of
their
faith
,
while
others
would
reject
the
spirit
of
God
on
account
ofthe
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
blindness
of
their
minds
,
while
,
ifit
had
not
been
for
this
,
they
might
had
as
great
privijege
as
their

.
Or
in

:
In

they
were
on

thus
this
holy

being
preparcd
from

of

world
for
such
as
would
not
harden
their
hearts
,
being
in

through

of

,
which
was

CHAPTER
X
.
Now
as
I
said
concerning
the
holy
order
of
wie
i
Priesthood
:
Phere
were
many
which
were
ordained
and
betame
High
Priests
of
God
;
and
it
was
on'account
.
of
the
exweding
feith'and
repentance
,
and
their
righteousness
before
God
,
iliey
choosing
to
repent
and
work
righteousness
,
rather
than
toperish
;
therefore
they
were
called
niter
this
holy
order
,
thd
were
sanctified
,
and
their
garments
were'
washed
white
,
through
the
blood
of
the
Lamb
.
Now
they
,
after
being'
sancA
by
the
Holy
Ghost
,
haying
their
garments
made
white
,
_
Reine
pure
and
vpotiess
before
God
,
could
not
look
upon
sin
,
Sweit
were
with
abhortence
;
and
there
were
pe
excecdng
grdat
many
,
which
were
made
pure
,
and
entered
into'
the
[File:264]
rest
of
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
now
,
my
brethren
,
I
wouly
that
ye
should
humble
yourselves
before
God
,
and
bring
fori
fruit
mete
for
repentance
,
that
ye
may
also
enter
into
that
rest
,
yea
,
humble
yoursclvas
even
as
the
people
in
the
days
of
Mg
,
chizedek
,
who
was
also
a
Iligh
Priest
after
.
this
same
which
1
bave
spoken
,
who
also
took
upon
him
the
High
Prieg
hood
forever
.
And
it
was
this
same
Melchizedek
te
whom
Abraham
paid
tithes
;
yea
,
even
our
futher
Abraham
paid
tithe
of
one
tenth
part
of
all
he
possessed
.
Now
these
ordinaner
were
given
after
this
manner
,
that
therehy
the
people
might
look
forward
on
the
Son
of
God
,
it
being
a
type
of
his
ordep
or
it
being
bis
order
;
and
this
,
that
they
miglit
look
forward
to
him
for
a
remission
of
their
sins
,
that
they
might
enter
ing
the
rest
of
the
Lord
.
_
Now
this
Melchizedck
was
a
king
over
the
land
of
Salem
:
and
his
people
had
waxed
strong
in
iniquity
and
abominations
;
yeu
,
they
had
all
gone
astray
:
they
were
full
of
all
maunerg
wickedness
;
but
Melchizedek
having
exercised
mighty
faith
and
received
the
office
of
the
High
Priesthood
,
according
to
the
hely
orderof
God
,
did
preach
repentance
unto
his
people
—
And
behold
,
they
did
repent
;
and
Melchizedck
did
establish
peace
in
the
land
in
his
days
;
therefore
he
was
called
the
Prince
of
Peace
,
for
he
was
the
king
of
Salem
;
and
he
di
reign
under
his
father
.
Now
there
were
many
before
hiny
J
and
also
there
were
many
afierwards
,
but
none
were
greater
;
therefore
of
him
they
have
more
particularly
made
mention
Now
I
need
not
rehcarse
the
matter
;
what
I
have
said
,
may
suffice
.
Behold
,
the
Scriptures
are
before
you
;
if
ye
willar
rest
them
,
it
shall
be
to
your
own
destruction
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Alma
had
said
thes'
words
unto
them
,
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
unto
them
and
eried
with
a
mighty
voice
,
saying
,
Now
is
the
time
to
repent
,
sor
the
day
of
salvation
draweth
nieh
;
yea
,
and
tho
voice
of
the
Lord
,
by
the
mouth
of
angels
,
doth
deelare
it
unto
all
oF
tions
;
yea
,
doth
declare
it
,
that
they
may
have
glad
tidings
of
great
joy
;
yea
,
and
he
doth
sound
these
glad
tidings
among
all
his
people
,
yea
,
even
to
them
thatlare
seattered
abroad
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
;
wherefore
they
have
come
unte
us
—
And
they
are
made
known
unto
us
in
plain
terms
,
that
we
may
understand
,
that
we
cannot
err
;
an
this
because
of
our
beitz
wanderers
ina
strange
land
;
therefore
we
are
thus
highly
f
vored
,
for
we
have
these
glad
tidings
declared
unto
us
in
all
parts
of
our
vineyard
.
For
behold
,
angels
are
declaring
it
um
[File:265]
io
many
at
this
time
in
our
land
;
and
this
is
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
for
to
receive
his
word
,
at
the
time
of
his
coming
in
his
glory
.
And
now
we
gily
wait
to
hear
the
joyful
news
declared
unto
us
by
the
mouth
of
angels
,
of
his
coming
:
for
the
time
cometh
,
we'know
nothow
soon
.
Would
to
God
that
it
might
be
in
my
day
;
but
let
it
be
sooner
or
later
,
fn
it
I
will
yejoice
,
And
it
shall
be
made
knwon
unto
just
and
holy
men
,
by
the
mouth
of
angels
,
athe
lime
of
his
coming
,
that
the
words
of
our
fathers
might
be
fulfilled
,
according
to
that
which
they
have
spoken
coneerning
him
,
which
was
according
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy
which
wes
in
them
,
f
i
And
now
iny
brethren
,
I
wish
from
the
inmost
part
of
my
heart
,
yea
,
with
great
anxiety
,
even
unto
pain
,
that
ye
would
hearken
unto
my
words
,
and
cast
off
your
sins
,
and
not
proomastinate
the
day
of
your
repentance
;
but
that
ye
would
humble
yourselves
before
the
Lord
,
and
call
on
his
holy
name
,
and
watch
and
pray
continually
,
that
ye
may
not
be
tempted
above
tat
which
ye
can
bear
,
and
thus
be
led
by
the
holy
spirit
,
becoming
humble
,
meek
,
submissive
,
patient
,
full
of
love
and
all
lag
suffering
;
having
faith
on
the
Lerd
;
having
a
hope
that
yeshall
receive
eternal
life
;
having
the
love
of
God
always
myour
hearts
,
that
ye
may
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
,
end
enter
into
his
rest
;
and
may'
the
Lord
grant
unto
you
repentanee
,
that
ye
may
not
bring
down
his
wrath
upon
you
,
that
ye
nay
not
be
bound
down
by
the
chains
of
-
hell
,
that
ye
may
not
suilerthe
second
death
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
spake
Many
more
words
unto
the
people
,
which
are
not
written
im
this
books
,

_
And
iu
came
.
to
pass
that
after
he
had
made
an
end
of
speakig
unto
the
people
,
many
of
them
did
believe
on
his
words
,
aud
begun
to
repent
,
and
to
search
the
Scriptures
;
but
the
nore
part
of
them
were
desirous
that
they
might
destroy
Alma
ud
Amulek
:
for
they
were
angry
with
Alma
,
because
of
the
phinness
of
his
words
unto
Zeezrom
;
and
they
also
said
that
Amulek
had
lied
unto
them
,
and
had
reviled
against
their
Taw
,
mdalso
aguinst
their
Lawyers
and
Judges
.
And
they
-
were
ako
angry
with
Alma
-
and
Amulek
;
and
because
they
had
testified
so
plainly
against
their
wickedness
,:
they
sought
(
o
put
away
privily
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
not
;
but
they
took
them
and
bound
them
with
strong
cords
,
and
look
them
before
the
Chief
Judge
of
the
land
.
And
the
peoHs
went
forth
and
witnessed
against
.
them
,
testifyiig
that
they
[File:266]
had
reviled
against
the
law
,
and
their
Lawyers
and
J
udges
gf
the
land
,
and
also
all
the
people
that
were
in
the
land
;
and
aly
testified
that
there
was
but
one
God
,
and
that
he
should
se
his
Son
among
the
people
,
but
he
should
not
save
them
;
many
such
things
did
the
people
testify
against
Alma
and
An
.
ulek
.
And
it
came
to
:
pass
that
it
was
done
before
the
Chief
Judge
of
the
land
.
And
it
also
came
to
pass
that
Zeezrog
was
astonished
at
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
;
and
hy
also
knew
concerning
the
blindness
of
the
minds
which
he
hag
caused
among
the
people
,
by
his
lying
words
;
'
and
his
soy
)
began
to
be
harrowed
up
,
under
a
consciousness
of
his
own
guilt
;
yea
,
he
began
to
be
encircled
about
by
the
pains
gf
hell
.
i
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
hegan
to
cry
unto
the
people
soying
:
Behold
,
I
am
guilty
,
and
these
men
are
spotless
belo
f
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
began
to
,
plead
for
then
from
that
time
forth
;
but
they
reviled
him
,
saying
:
Art
thy
also
possessed
with
the
Devil
?
And
it
came
to
pass
that
tha
,
spit
upon
him
,
and
cast
him
out
fiom
among
theni
,
and
de
all
those
which
believed
in
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
Alma
and
Amulek
;
and
they
cast
them
out
,
and
sent
ma
to
cast
stones
at
them
.
And
they
brought
their
wives
ant
children
together
,
and
whosoever
believed
or
had
been
taught
to
believe
in
the
word
of
God
,
they
caused
that
they
should
be
cast
into
the
fire
;
and
they
also
brought
forth
their
recon
:
which
contained
the
Holy
Scriptures
,
and
cast
.
them
into
ile
fire
also
,
that
they
might
be
burned
and
destroyed
by
fire
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
Alma
and
Amulek
,
ant
carried
them
forth
to
the
place
of
martyrdom
,
that
they
might
Witness
the
destruction
of
those
which
were
consumed
by
fire
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Amulek
saw
the
pains
of
the
women
and
children
which
were
consuming
in
the
fire
,
he
was
also
pained
;
and
he
saith
unto
Alma
,
How
can
we
witnes
this
awful
scene
?
Therefore
let
us
.
streich
forth
our
hands
and
exercise
the
power
of
God
which
is
in
us
,
and
save
them
from
the
flames
.
But
Alma
saith
unto
him
,
The
spirit
cor
strameth
me
that
I
must
not
stretch
forth
mine
hand
;
for
be
hold
,
the
Lord
receiveth
them
up
unto
himself
,
in
glory
;
anl
he
.
doth
suffer
that
they
niay
do
this
thing
,
or
that
the
people
may
do
this
thing
unto
them
,
according
to
-
the
hardness
dl
their
hearts
,
that
the
judgments
which
he
shall
exercise
upon
them
in
his
wrath
,
may
be
just
;
and
the
blood
of
the
innocefl
shall
stand
as
a
witness
against
them
,
yea
,
and
cry
mightily
[File:267]
a
against
them
atthe
last
day
.
Now
.
Amulck
saith
unto
Alma
,
Rebold
,
perhaps
they
will
burn
us
also
.
And
Alma
saith
,
Be
it
according
to
the
willof
the
Lord
..
But
behold
,
our
work
is
,
not
finished
;
therefore
they
burn
us
not
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
bodies
of
those
which
had
been
cast
into
the
fire
,
were
consumed
,
and
also
the
records
which
were
cast
in
with
them
,
the
Chief
Judge
of
.
the
land
came
and
stood
before
Alina
and
Amulek
,
as
they
were
dound
;
and
he
smote
them
with
his
hand
upon
their
cheeks
and
saith
unto'
thom
,
Alter
what
ye
have
seen
,
will
ye
preach
again
unto
this
people
,
that
they
shall
be
cast
inte
a
lake
of
fre
and
brimstone
?
Behold
,
ye
see
that
ye
had
not
power
to
save
these
which
had
been
cast
into
the
fire
;
neither
hath
God
syed
them
because
they
were
of
thy
faith
.
And
the
Judge
amote
therm
again
upon
their
cheeks
,
and
asked
,
What
say
ye
foryourselves
?
Now
this
Judge
was
alter
the
order
and
faith
of
Nehor
,
which
slew
Gideon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
and
Amalek
answered
him
nothing
;
and
he
smote
thei
again
,
aud
delivered
them
.
to
the
officers
to
be
cast
into
prison
.
And
iteame
to
pass
that
when
they
had
been
cast
into
prison
three
days
,
there
came
many
Lawyers
,
and
Judges
,
and
Priests
,
and
teachers
,
which
were
of
the
profession
of
Nehor
;
and
they
came
in
unto
the
prison
to
see
them
,
end
they
questioned
them
about
many
words
;
but
they
answered
them
nothing
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Judge
stood
before
them
,
and
.
saith
,.
Why
do
ye
not
answer
the
words
of
this
people
?
Know
ye
not
that
I
have
power
to
deliver
ye
up
unto
the
flames
?
And
,
he
commanded
them
to
speak
;
but
they
answered
nothing
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
departed
and
went
their
ways
,
but
came
again
on
the
morrow
;
and
the
Judge
also
smote
them
again
on
their
checks
.
And
many
came
forth
also
,
and
smote
them
,
saying
:
Will
ye
stand
again
and
Judge
this
peope
,
aud
condemn
our
law
?
If
ye
have
such
great
power

which
was

eyen
into

,
and
began
to
slay
i
people
,
and
to
destroy
the
city
.
And
now
it
came
to

before

(
and
his
name
was
Zoram

and

he

Lehi
and
Aha
:)
Now
Zoram
and
his
ivosons
,
knowing
that
Alma
was
High
Priest
over
the
Church
,
and
having
heard
that
he
had
the
spirit
of
prophecy
,
therefore
they
went
unto
him
and
desired
of
him
to
know
whether
the
Lord
would
that
they
should
go
inte
the
wilderness
in
search
d
their
brethren
,
who
had
been
taken
captive
by
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
inquired
of
the
Lord
concernng
the
matter
.
And
Alma
returned
and
said
unto
them
,
Behold
the
Lamanites
will
cross
the
river
Sidon
in
the
south
wildemess
,
away
up
beyond

And
behold
there

,
and
there
the
Lord
will
deliver
unto
thee
thy
brethren
which
have

And
it
came
to

that
Zoram
and
his
sons
crossed
over
the
river
Sidon
,
with
their
armies
,
and
marched
away
beyond
he
borders
of
Manti
,
into
the
south
wilderness
,
which
was
-
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
Sidon
.
And
they
came
upon
the
arnies
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
the
Lamanites
were
scattered
and
triven
into
the
wilderness
;
and
they
took
their
brethren
which
had
been
taken
captive
by
the
Lamanites
,
and
there
was
.
not
te
soul
of
them
which
had
been
lost
,
that
were
taken
captive
.
And
they
were
brought
by
their
brethren
to
possess
their
own
lads
,
And
thus
ended
the
eleventh
year
of
the
Judges
,
the
Lamanites
Wilviug
been
driven
out
of
the
land
,
and
the
people
of
Ammonihah
were
destroyed
;
yea
,
every
living
soul
of
the
Atmonihahites
were
destroyed
,
and
also
their
great
City
;
whieh
they
said
God
could
not
destroy
,
because
of
its
greatness
.—
But
hichold
,
in
one
day
it
was
left
desolate
;
and
their
carcases
Were
mangled
by
dogs
and
wild
beasts
of
the
wilderness
;
ertheless
,
afier
many
days
,
their
dead
bodies
were
heaped
Pupoa
the
face
of
the
earth
,
and
they
were
covered
with
a
ullow
covering
.
And
now
so
great
was
the
scent
thereof
,
that
the
people
did
not
go
in
to
possess
the
land
of
Ammeni
for
many
years
.
And
it
was
called
desolation

against
the
Nephites
till
the
fourteenth
year
of
th

of

And
thus
for
three
years
did
the
people
of

[File:272]
And
Alma

unto

kingdom
,
for
the
w
of
God
,
and
weni
up
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
to
preach
to
the
Lamanites
.—
Their_
sufferings
and
deliverance
,
according
to
the
record
of
Mla
.
Anp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
as
Alma
was
journeying
from
the
land
of
Gideon
,
southward
,
away
to
the
land
of
Manti
,.
behold
,
to
his
astonishment
,
he
met
with
the
seas
of
Mosiah
,
a
jumeying
towards
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
Now
these
sons
of
Mosiah
were
with
Alma
at
the
time
the
angel
first
appeared
uito
him
;
therefore
Alma
did
rejoice
exceedingly
,
to
see
his
lnethron
;-
and
what
added
more
to
his
Joy
,
they
were
still
his
irethren
in
the
Lord
;
yea
,
and
they
had
waxed
strong
in
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
;
for
they
were
men
of
a
sound
understanding
,
and
they
had
searched
the
Scriptures
diligently
,
that
they
might
know
the
word
of
God
.
But
this
is
not
all
:
they
had
given
themselves
to
much
prayer
,
and
fasting
,
therefore
they
had
the
spirit
of
prophecy
,
and
the
spirit
of
revelation
,
ail
when
they
taught
,
they
taught
with
power
and
authority
,
Sen
as
with
the
power
and
authority
of
God
.
And
they
had
Yen
teaching
the
word
of
God
for
the
space
of
fourteen
years
,
among
the
Lumanites
,
having
had
much
success
in
bringing
aay
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
3
yea
,
by
the
power
of
their
Norrs
,
many
were
brought
before
the
aliar
of
God
,
to
call
on
hiscname
,
and
confess
their
sits
before
him
.
'
Now
these
are
circumstances
which
attended
them
in
their
journeyings
,
for
they
had
many
afflictions
;
they
did
suffer
much
,
both
in
yandin
mind
;
such
as
hunger
,
thirst
end
faticue
,
and
alinech
labor
in
the
spirit
,
Now
these
were
their
joyrneyes
having
taken
leave
of
their
father
Mosiah
,
in
the
first
year
the
reign
of
the
Judges
;
having
refused
the
kingdom
ivhich
eirfather
was
desirous
to
confer
upon
them
;
and
alsq
,
this
tas
the
minds
of
the
people
;
nevertheless
they
departed
ont
the
land
of
Zerahemla
,
ond
took
their
swords
,
and
their
fasand
their
bows
,
and
their
arrows
,
aad
thei
slings
;
and
Sthey
done
that
they
might
provide
fod
for
themselves
ile
iu
the
wilderness
:
and
thus
they
departed
info
the
wile
ess
,
with
their
numbers
which
they
had
selected
,
to
go
up
ee
of
Nephi
,
to
preach
the
word
of
God
unto
the
Lanites
,
=
And
it
came
to
ass
that
they
journeyed
many
days
in
the
Pp
ed
[File:274]
wilderness
,
and
they
fasted
much
,
and
prayed
much
,
that
the
Lord
would
grant
unto
them
a
portion
of
his
spirit
to
go¥
them
,
and
abide
with
them
,
that
they
might
be
an
instrument

the
hands
of
God
,
to
bring
,
if
it
were
possible
,
their

the
Lamanites
,
to
the
knowledge
of
the
(
ruth
;
to
the
kno
edge
of
the
baseness
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
,
whi
were
not
correct

;
4
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
visit
them
with}
spirit
,
and
said
unto
them
,
Be
eomforted
;
and
they
were
e
forted
.
And
the
Lord
said
unto
them
also
,
Go
forth
amo
the
Lamanites
,
thy
brethren
,
and
establish
my
word
;
yet
shall
be
patient
in
long
suifering
and

,
that

And
it'came
to
pass
that
the
hearts
of
the
sons
of
Mos
and
also
those
which
were
with
them
,
took
courage
to
wi
anto
the
Lamanites
,
to
declare
unto
them
the
word
of
Got
And
it
came
to
pass
when
they
had
arriven
in
the
ban
of
the
land
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
separated

and
departed
cne
from

,
trusting
in
the
Lord
,
that
;
should
meet
again
at
the
close
of

:
for
they
posed

yet
they
souzht
to
obtain
these
things
by
murder
and
pjundering
,
that
they
might
not

:
thus
they
were
a
very
indolent
people
,
manyal
whom
did
worship

,
und
the
curse
of
God
had
fell

;

ing
,
the

were

went

—
Now

stations
,
having
imparted
the
word
of

unto

,
or
administered

before

departure
;
and
thus
the
'y
took
their
several
journeys
throughout

land

And
Ammon
weutto
the

of
Ishmael
,
the
land
being
called
after

the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
whieh
also
became
Lamanites
.
And
as
Ammon
enicred
the
land
of
Ishmacl
,
the
Lamanites
took
him
and
bound
him
,
as
was
their
custom
,
to
bind
all
the
Nephites
which
fell
into
their
hands
,
und
carry
them
before
the
king
;
and
thus
it
was
left
to
the
pleasure
of
the
king
to
slay
them
,
or
to
retain
them
in
captivity
,
or
te
cast
them
into
prison
,
or
to
cast
them
out
of
his
land
,
according
to
tis
will
and
pleasure
;
and
thus
Ammon
was
carried
before
the
king
which
was
over
the
land
of
Ishmael
;
and
his
name
was
lamoni
;
and
he
was
a
descendant
of
Ishmael
.
And
the
king
inguired
of
Ammon
if
it
were
his
desires
to
divell

the
Lamanites
,

And

Audit
came
to

that
king
Lamoni
was
much
pleased
with
Ammon

end
caused
that
his

should
be
loosed

Bit
Ammon
saith
unto
him

And
it
came
to

that
they
went
in
search
of
the
focks
,
and
they
did
follow
Ammon
,
and
they
rushed
forth
with
much
swiftness
,
and
did
head
the
flocks
of
the
king
,
and
did
gather
them
together
again
,
to
the
place

And
those
men
again
stood
to
scatter
their
flocks
;
but
Ammon
saith
ynto
his

,
Encircle

that

I

Wherefore
they
did
as
Ammon
commanded
them
,
aol
he
went
forth
and
stood
to
contend
with
those
which
stood
br
the
waters
of
Sebus
;

they
were
not

few
;
therefore
they
did
not

for
they
suppose
that
one
of

could
siay
him
,
according
to
their
ples

they
knew
not
that

that
he
would
deliver
his
sons
out

;
neitherdil
they

in

destruction

they

And
when

had
all
westified
to
the

which
they

he
had
learned

faithfulness
of
Ammon

also
his
great
power
in

against
those
who
sought

he
was
astonished
exceedingly
,
and
saith
,
Surely

hisis
more
than

Behold

is
not
this
the
Great

of

we

O

we
do

we

And

the

unto

Now
I
hho
that
it

he

down
at

to
preserve

that
I
might

you

Now
this
is
the
Great

of

our

have

he
had

from

Notwithstanding

they
pposel
that
whatsoever
they
did

was

nevertheless

began

to
the
landif
Nephi
:
for
there
had
been
a
great
feast
appointed
:
at
the
lang
of
Nephi
,
by
the
father
of
Lamoni
,
who
was
king
over'all
the
land
.
Now
when
king
Lamoni
heard
that
Amnon
was
pre
.
aring
his
horses
and
his
chariotsy
he
was
more
astonished
,
Loins
of
the
faithfulness
of
Ammon
,
saying
:
Surely
,
there
has
not
been
any
servant
among
all
my
servants
,
that
has
beey
so
faithful
as
this
man
;
for
even
he
doth”
remember
allmy
commandmenis
to
execute
them
.
Now
I
surely
know
that
this
is
the
Great
Spirit
;
and
I
would
desire
him
that
he
come
jn
unto
me
,
bul
I
durat
not
.

And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Ammon
had
made
ready
the
horses
and
the
chariots
for
the
king
and
his
servants
,
he
went
in
unto
the
king
,
and
he
saw
that
the
countenance
of
the
kine
was
changed
;
therefore
he
was
about
to
return
out
of
his
pres
ence
;
and
one
of
the
king's
servants
said
unto
him
,
Rabbanal
,
which
is
,
being
interpreted
,
powerful
,
or
great
king
,
consider
ing
their
kings
io
be
powerful
;
and
thus
he
said
unto
him
,
Rabbanah
,
the
king
desiteth
thee
to
stay
;
therefore
Amu
turned
himself
unto
the
king
,
and
saith
unto
him
,
What
wilt
.
thou
that
1
should
do
for
thee
,
O
king
?
And
the
king
answe
ed
him
not
for
the
space
of
an
hour
,
according
to
their
tine
,
for
he
knew
not
what
he
should
say
unto
him
.
And
it
cate
to
pass
that
Ammon
said
unto
him
again
,
What
desirest
the
me
?
But
the
king
answered
bim
not
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Ammon
,
being
filled
with
the
spint
of
God
,
therefore
he
perceived
the
thoughts
of
the
king
,
And
he
saith
unto
him
,
Is
it
because
that
thou
hast
heard
that]
defended
thy
servants
and
thy
flocks
,
and
slew
seven
of
thier
brethren
with
the
sling
,
and
with
the
sword
,
and
smote
of
tle
arms'of
others
,
in
order
to
defend
thy
flocks
and
thy
servants
;
-
bebold
,
is
it
this
that
causcth
thy
marvellings
?
1
say
unto
you
,
What
is
it
,
that
thy
marvellings
are
so'great
+
Behold
,
Dame
man
,
and
am
thy
servant
;
therefore
,
whatsoever
thou
desins
which
is
right
,
that
will
Ido
.
Now
when
the
king
had
heard
these
words
,
he
marvelled
again
,
for
be
beheld
that
Ammoi
could
discern
his
thoughts
;
but
notwithstanding'
chis
,
king
Lamoni
did
open
bis
mouth
,
and'said
unto
him
,
Who
art
thot
!
Art
thou
that
Great
Spirit
,
which
knows
all
things
?
Amun
answered
and
said
unto
him
,
Tam
not
.
”
And
the
king
saith
,
[File:279]
How
knowest
thou
the
thoughts
of
ny
heart
?
Thou
mayest
speak
boldly
,
and
tell
me
concerning
thege
things
;
and
also
tell
me
by
what
power
ye
slew
and
smote
off
the
arms
of
my
brethren
,
that
seattered
my
flocks
,
And
now
if
thou
wilt
tell
me
concerning
these
things
,
whatsoever
thou
desirest
,
I
will
give
unto
thee
;
and
if
it
were
necded
,
¥
would
guard
thee
with
ny
armics
;
bat
I
know
that
thou
art
more
powerful
than
all
they
;
nevertheless
,
whatsoever
thou
desirest
of
me
,
{
will
grant
it
unto
thee
.
Now
Ammon
being
wise
,
yet
harmless
,
lie
saith
unto
Lamoni
,
Wilt
than
hearken
unto
my
words
,
if
I
tell
thee
by
what
power
do
these
things
?
and
this
is
the
thing
iat
I
desire
of
thee
.
And
the
king
answered
him
,
and
said
,
Yea
,
1
will'
believe
all
thy
words
;
and
thus
he
was
caught
with
guile
.
And
Ammon
began
to
speak
unto
him
with
boldnes
,
and
said
unto
him
,
Believest
thou
that
there
is
a
God
?
dnd
he
answered
,
and
said
unto
him
,
Ido
not
know
what
that
meaneti
.
And
then
Ammon
saith
,
Believest
thou
that
there
isa
Great
Spirit
?
And
he
saith
,
Yea
.
And
Ammon
saith
,
This
is
God
.
And
Ammon
saith
unto
him
again
,
Believest
tow
that
this
Great
Spirit
,
which
is
God
,
created
all
things
,
which
is
in
Heaven
and
in
the
,
Earth
?
And
he
saith
,
Yea
,
I
believe
that
he
created
all
things
which
is
in
the
earth
;
but
I
tonot
know
the
Heavens
.
'
And
Ammon
saith
unto
him
,
The
Heavens
.
is
a
place
where
God
dwells
,
and
all
bis
holy
:
angels
.
And
king
Lamoni
saith
,
Is
it
above
the
earth
?
And
Ammon
saith
,
Yea
,
and
he
looketh
down
upon
all
the
children
of
inen
;
and
he
knows
all
the
thoughts
and
intents
of
the
heart
:
forhy
hiskand
were
they
all
created
,
from
the
beginning
,
And
q
Lamoni
saith
,
T
believe
alt
these
things
which
thou
hast
spo
-
7
Aen
,
Art
thou
sent
from
God
?
Ammon
saith
unto
him
,
Tam
dtmen}
and
man
jn
the
beginning
,
was
created
after
the
image
oGod
;
and
I
am
called
by
his
Holy
Spirit
to
teach
these
things
unto
this
people
,
that
they
may
be
brought
'to
a
knowltige
of
that
which
is
just
and
true
;
and
-
a
portion
of
that
Spiritdwelleth
in
me
,
which
giveth
me
knowledge
,
and
also
powaccording
to
iny
faith
and
desires
which
is
in
God
.
Ww
when
Ammon
had
said
these
words
,
he
began
to
the
ereation
dl
the
:
world
;
and
also
to
the
creation
of
Adam
,
and
told
him
Il
the
things
concerning
the
fall
of
man
,
and
rehearsed
and
4kid
before
bin
the
records
and
the
Holy
Scriptures
of
the
People
,
and
which
had
been
spoken
by
the
prophets
,
even
own
to
the
time
that
their
father
Lehi
left
crusalem
;
and
Mtalso
rehearsed
unto
them
(
for
it
was
unto
the
king
and
to
[File:280]
his
servants
,)
all
the
journeyings
of
their
fathers
in
the
wildesness
,
and
all
their
sufferings
with
hunger
and
thirst
,
and
their
travel
,
&c
.;
and
be
also
rehearsed
unto
them
concerning
the
rebellions
of
Laman
and
Lemucl
,
and
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
yea
,
all
their
rebellions
did
he
relate
unto
them
;
and
he
expounded
unto
them
all
the
records
and
Scriptures
,
from
the
time
that
Lehi
left
Jerusalem
,
down
to
the
present
iime
;
but
this
is
not
all
,
for
he
expounded
unto
them
the
plan
of
redemption
,
which
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
;
and
he
also
made
known
unto
them
concerning
the
coming
of
Christ
;
and
all
the
works
of
the
Lord
did
he
make
know
unto
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
he
had
said
all
these
things
,
and
expounded
them
to
the
king
,
that
the
king
believed
alt
his
words
.
And
he
began
to
cry
unto
the
Lord
,
saying
:
0
Lord
,
have
mercy
;
according
to
thy
abundant
mercy
which
thou
hast
had
upon
the
people
of
Nephi
,
have
upon
me
and
my
people
.
And
now
when
he
had
said
this
,
he
fell
unto
the
earth
,
as
if
he
were
dead
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
his
servants
took
him
and
carried
him
in
unto
his
wife
,
and
laid
him
upon
a
bed
;
and
he
lay
as
if
he
were
dead
,
for
the
space
of
two
days
and
two
nights
;
and
his
wife
,
and
his
sons
,
and
his
daughters
inourned
over
him
,
after
the
manner
of
the
Lamaaites
,
greatly
lamenting
his
loss
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
two
days
and
two
nights
,
they
were
about
to
take
his
body
and
lay
it
ina
sepulchre
which
they
had
made
for
the
purpose
of
burying
their
dead
.
Nowithe
queen
having
heard
of
the
fame
of
Ammon
,
therefore
she
sent
and
desired
that
he
should
come
in
unto
her
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Ammon
did
as
he
was
commanded
,
and
went
in
unto
the
queen
,
and
desired
to
know
what
she
would
that
he
should
do
.
And
she
saith
unto
him
,
The
servants
of
my
hus
:
band
have
made
it
known
unto
-
me
,
that
thou
art
a
prophet
of
a
Holy
God
,
and
that
thou
hast
power
to
do
many
mighty
works
in
his
name
;
therefore
,
if
this
is
the
case
,
I
would
that
ye
should
go
in
and
see
my
husband
,
for
he
has
been
Jaid
upon
his
bed
for
the
space
of
two
days
and
two
nights
;
and
some
say
that
he
is
not
dead
,
but
others
say
that
he
is
dead
,
and
that
be
stinketh
,
and
that
he
ought
to
be
placed
in
the
sepulchre
;
but
as
for
myself
,
to
me
he
doth
not
stink
.
Now
this
was
what
Ammon
desired
,
for
he
knew
that
king
Lamoni
was
under
the
power
of
God
;
he
knew
that
the
dark
yeil
of
unbelief
being
cast
away
from
his
mind
,
and
the
light
which
di
[File:281]
fight
up
his
mind
,
which
was
the
light
of
the
glory
of
God
,
whieh
was
a
marvellous
light
of
his
goodness
;
yea
,
this
light
had
infused
such
joy
into
his
soul
,
the
cloud
of
darkness
haying
geen
dispelled
,
and
the
light
-
of
everlasting
light
was
lit
up
inhis
soul
;
yea
,
he
knew
that
this
had
overcame
his
natural
frame
,
and
he
was
carried
away
in
God
;
therefore
,
what
the
queen
desired
of
him
,
was
his
only
desire
.
Therefore
he
went
in
to
see
the
king
,
according
as
the
queen
had
desired
him
;
and
he
saw
the
king
,
and
he
knew
that
he
was
not
dead
.
And
be
saith
unto
the
queen
,
He
is
not
dead
,
but
he
sleepeth
in
God
,
and
on
the
morrow
he
shall
rise
again
;
therefore
bury
him
not
.
And
Ammon
saith
unto
her
,
Believest
thou
this
?
And
she
said
unto
him
,
I
have
had
no
witness
,
save
thy
word
,
and
the
word
of
our
servants
;
nevertheless
,
{
believe
that
it
shall
be
according
as
thou
hast
said
.
And
Ammon
said
unto
her
,
Blessed
art
thou
,
because
of
thy
exceeding
faith
;
1
say
unto
thee
,
woman
,
there
has
not
heen
such
great
faith
among
all
the
people
of
the
Nephites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
thet
she
watched
over
the
hed
of
her
husband
,
from
that
time
,
even
until
that
time
on
the
merrow
which
Ammon
had
appointed
that
he
should
rise
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
arose
,
according
to
the
words
of
Ammon
;
and
as
he
arose
,
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
unto
the
woman
,
and
said
,
Blessed
be
the
name
of
God
,
and
blessed
art
thou
:
for
as
surc
as
thou
livest
,
behold
,
I
have
seen
my
Redeemer
;
and
he
shall
come
forth
,
and
be
born
of
a
woman
,
and
he
shall
redeem
all
mankind
who
believe
on
his
name
.
Now
when
he
had
said
these
words
,
his
heart
was
swollen
within
him
,
and
he
sunk
again
with
joy
;
and
the
queen
also
sunk
down
,
being
overpowered
by
the
spirit
.
Now
Ammon
seeing
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
poured
out
according
to
his
prayers
upon
the
Lamaniles
,
his
brethren
,
which
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
nourning
among
the
Nephites
,
or
among
all
the
people
of
God
,
hecause
of
their
iniquities
and
their
traditions
;
and
Ammon
fell
upon
his
knees
,
and
began
to
pour
out
his
soul
in
prayer
and
thanksgiving
to
God
,
for
what
he
had
done
for
his
brethFen
;
and
he
was
also
overpowered
with
joys
and
thus
they
al
three
had
sunk
to
the
earth
.
Now
when
the
servants
of
the
king
had
seen
that
they
had
fallen
,
they
also
began
to
-
cry
into
God
,
for
the
fear
of
the
Lord
had
come
upon
themalsy
:
fot
was
they
which
had
stood
before
the
king
,
and
testified
bea
concerning
the
great
power
of
Ammon
.
nd
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
call
on
the
name
of
the
[File:282]
Lord
in
their
might
,
even
until
they
had
-
all
fallen
to
the
cart
,
sayeit
were
one
of
the
Lamanitish
women
,
whose
name
was
Abish
,
she
haying
been
converted
unto
the
Lord
for
mans
yars
,
on
account
of
a
remarkable
vision
of
her
father
;
this
haying
been
converted
to
the
Lord
,
never
had
made
it
known
;
therefore
when
she
saw
that
all
the
servants
of
Lamoni
had
fallen
to
the
earth
,
and
also
her
mistress
,
the
queen
,
and
the
king
,
and
Ammon
lay
prostrate
upon
the
earth
,
she
knew
that
it
was
the
power
of
God
;
and
supposing
that
this
opportunity
,
by
making
known
unto
the
people
what
had
happened
among
them
,
that
by
beholding
this
scene
,
it
would
cause
them
to
be
.
lieve
i
in
the
power
of
God
,
therefore
she
ran
forth
from
house
to
house
,
making
it
known
unto
the
people
;
and
they
began
to
assemble
themselves
together
unto
the
house
of
the
Icing
And
there
came
a
multitude
,
and
to
their
astonishment
,
they
beheld
the
king
,
and
the
queen
,
and
their
servants
,
prostrate
upon
the
earth
,
and
they
all
lay
there
as
though
they
wer
dead
;
and
they
also
saw
Ammon
,
and
behold
,
he
was
a
Ne
phite
.
And
iow
the
people
began
to
murmur
dmong
them
selves
;
some
saying
,
That
it
was
a
great
evil
that
had
come
upon
them
,
or
upon
the
king
and
his
house
,
because
he
had
suTered
that
the
Nephite
should
remain
in
the
land
.
But
others
rebuked
them
,
saying
,
The
king
hath
brought
this
evil
upon
bis
house
,
because
he
slew
his
servants
who
had
had
.
their
flocks
scattered
at
the
waters
of
Scbus
;
and
they
were
also
rebuked
by
those
men
which
had
stood
at
the
waters
of
Se
bus
,
and
scattered
the
flocks
which
belonged
to
the
king
,
for'
they
were
angry
with
Ammon
because
of
the
number
which
he
had
slain
of
their
brethren
at
the
waters
of
Sebus
,
while
defending
the
flocks
of
the
king
,
Now
one
of
them
,
whose
brother
had
been
slain
with
the
sword
of
Ammon
,
being
oe
eeeding
angry
with
Ammon
,
drew
his
sword
and
went
forth
that
he
might
Jet
it
fall
upon
Ammon
,
to
slay
him
;
and
as
be
Jifted
the
sword
to
smite
him
,
behold
,
he
fell
dead
.
Now
we
see
that
Ammon
cond
not
ina
slain
,
for
the
Lord
had
said
unte
Mosiah
,
his
father
,
T
will
spare
him
,
and
it
shall
he
unto
bim
according
to
thy
faith
;
therefore
Mosiah
trusted
him
unto
the
Lord
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
multitude
bebeld
that
the
man
had
fell
dead
,
who
lifted
the
sword
to
slay
Ammon
,
fear
came
upon
them
al
,
and
they
durst
not
put
forth
their
hands
to
teuch
him
,
or
any
of
those
which
had
fallen
;
and
P
they
began
to
mary
:
al
again
among
themselves
,
what
could
be
[File:283]
the
eayse
of
this
great
power
,
or
what
all
thesg
things
could
pean
.
;
.
s
:
And
itcame_to
pass
that
-
there
was
many
among
them
,
who
said
that
Ammon
was
the
Great
Spirit
,
and
others
said
he
was
sent
by
the
Great
Spirit
;
but
others
rebuked
them
all
,
saying
,
That
he
was
a
monster
,
which
hath
been
sent
from
the
Nephites
to
torment
us
;
and
there
were
some
which
said
that
Ammon
was
sent
by
the
Great
Spirit
to
affiict
them
,
because
of
their
iniquities
,
and
that
it
was
the
Great
Spirit
that
had
ahvays
attended
the
Nephites
,
which
had
ever
dehivered
them
out
of
their
hands
;
and
they
said
that
it
was
this
Great
Spirit
which
had
destrayed
so
many
of
their
brethren
,
the
Lanianies
;
and
thus
the
contention
began
to
be
excecding
sharp
among
them
.
And
while
they
were
thus
contending
,
the
woman
servant
which
had
caused
the
multitude
to
be
gathered
fogether
,
came
;
and
when
she
saw
the
contention
which
was
among
the
multitude
,
she
was
exceeding
sorrowful
,
even
unto
tears
.
i
And
it
came
to
pass
that
she
went
and
took
the
queen
by
the
hand
,
that
perhaps
she
might
raise
her
from
the
ground
;
and
as
soon
as
she
touched
her
hand
,
she
arose
and
stood
upon
her
feet
,
and
.
cried
with
a
loud
voice
,
saying
:
O
blessed
©
Jesus
,
who
has
saved
me
from
an
awful
hell
!
O
blessed
God
,
i
ave
merey
on
this
people
.
And
when
she
had
said
this
,
she
shsped
her
hands
,
being
filled
with
joy
,
speaking
many
words
which
were
not
understood
;
and
when
she
had
done
this
,
she
took
the
king
,
Lamoni
,
-
by
the
hand
,
and
behold
,
he
arose
and
stood
upon
his
feet
;
and
he
immediately
,
sceing
the
contention
anoug
his
people
,
went
forth
and
began
to
rebuke
them
,
and
foteach
them
the
words
which
he
had
heard
from
the
mouth
of
Ammon
;
and
as
many
as
heard
his
words
,
believed
,
and
Were
conyerted
unto
.
the
Lord
.
But
there
were
many
among
them
which
would
not
hear
bis
words
;
therefore
they
went
their
way
..,
E
'
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Ammon
arose
,
jhe
also
ad
-
mMinistered
unto
them
,
and
also
did
all
the
servants
of
Lamoni
;
and
they
did
all
declare
unto
the
people
the
:
self
-
same
thing
:
that
their
hearts
had
been
changed
;
that
they
had
no
more

.
And
behold
,
many
did
declare
unto
the
people
tthey
had
seen
angels
,
and
had
conversed
with
them
;
and
s
they
had
told
them
things
of
God
,
and
of
his

commenes
among
the
Lamanites
;
thus
the
Lord
did
begin
to
pour
ou
his
spirit
upon
them
;
and
we
see
that
his
arm
is
extended
tp
all
people
who
will
repent
and
believe
on
his
name
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
established
q
church
in
that
land
,
that
king
Lamoni
desired
that
Ammop
should
go
with
him
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
that
he
might
show
him
unto
his
father
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
Lord
came
to
Ammon
,
saying
:
Thou
shalt
not
go
up
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
for
behold
,
the
king
will
seek
thy
life
;
but
thoy
shalt
go
to
the
land
of
Middoni
;
for
behold
,
thy
brother
As
ron
,
and
also
Muloki
and
Ammah
are
in
prison
,
is
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Ammon
had
heard
this
,
saith
unto
Lamoni
,
Behold
,
my
brother
and
brethren
:
are
ia
prison
at
Middoni
,
end
Igo
that
I
may
deliver
them
.
Now
Le
moni
saith
unto
Ammon
,
I
know
,
in
the
strength
of
the
Low
,
thou
canst
do
all
things
.
But
behold
,
I
will
go
with
thee
io
the
land
of
Middoni
;
for
the
king
of
the
land
of
Middosi
,
whose
name
is
Antiomno
,
is
a
friend
unto
me
;
therefore
I
go
tp
the
land
of
Middoni
,
that
I
may
flatter
the
king
of
the
land
;
and
he
will
cast
thy
brethrenout
of
prison
.
Now
Lema
saith
unto
him
,
Who
told
thee
that
my
brethren
were
in
prison
!
And
Ammon
saith
unto
him
,
No
one
.
hath
told
me
,
save
ith
:
God
:
and
he
said
unto
me
,
Go
and
deliver
thy
brethren
,
for
they
are
in
prison
in
the
land
of
Middoni
.
Now
when
Lam
ni
had
heard
this
,
he
caused
that
his
servants
should
male
-
vefidy
his
horses
,
and
his
chariots
,
And
he
saith
unto
Ant
mon
,
Come
,
will
go
with
thee
down
to
the
land
of
Mit
den}
,
and
there
J
will
plead
with
the
king
,
that
he
will
cast
thy
brethren
out
of
prison
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
Ammon
and
Lamoni
wasa
journeying
thither
,
that
they
met
the
father
of
Lamoni
,
who
was
king
over
all
the
land
.
And
behold
,
the
father
of
Lamon
saith
unto
him
,
Why
did
ye
not
come
.
to
the
feast
,
on
that
great
day
when
I
made
a
feast
unto
my
sons
,
and
unto
my
people
?
And
he
also
saith
,
Whither
art
thou
going
with
this
Nephite
,
which
is
one
of
the
childrer
of
aliar
?
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Lamoni
rehearst
unto
him
whither
he
was
going
for
he
feared
to
offend
him
.
And
he
also
told
him
all
the
cause
of
his
tarrying
in
-
his
own
kingdom
,
that
he
did
not
go”
unto
his
father
,
to
the
feast
which
he
had
-
prepared
,
And”
now
when
Lamoni
had
rehearsed
unto
him
all
these
things
,
[File:285]
Whold
,
to
-
bis
astonishment
,
his
father
was
angry
with
him
,
ad
saith
,
Lamoni
,
thou
art
going
to
deliver
these
Nephites
,
which
are
Sons
Of
a
itar
.
Behold
,
he
robbed
our
fathers
;
ad
now
his
children
are
also
come
amongst
us
,
that
they
may
,
by
their
cunning
and
their
lyings
,
deceive
us
,
that
they
gain
may
rob
us
of
our
property
.
Now
the
father
of
Lamomeommannded
him
that
hes
!
ould
slay
Ammon
,
with
the
syord
,
And
he
alao
commanded
him
thar
he
should
not
goto
the
land
of
Middoni
;
but
that
he
siould
return
with
tim
,
tothe
lend
of
Ishmael
But
Lamoni
saith
unto
him
,
I
wilnotslay
Ammon
,
neither
will
}
return
to
the
land
of
Isheel
,
but
I
vo
to
the
land
of
Middoni
,
that
1
may
release
the
lethren
of
Ammon
,
for
I
know
that
they
are
just
men
,
and
boly
prophets
of
the
true
God
.
Now
whea
his
father
heard
hese
words
,
he
was
angry
with
him
,
and
he
drew
his
sword
tat
he
might
smite
him
to
the
carth
.
But
Ammon
stood
forth
ad
saith
unto
him
,
Behold
,
thou
shalt
not
slay
thy
son
;
nevertheless
,
it
were
better
that
he
should
fall
han
thee
:
for
bebold
,
he
hath
repented
of
his
sins
;
but
if
thou
shouldst
fall
at
itis
time
,
in
thine
anger
,
thy
soul
could
not
be
saved
.
And
iin
:
Itis
expedient
that
thou
shouldst'
forbear
;
for
if
thou
swuldst
slay
thy
son
,
(
he
being
and
inmoceat
wan
,)
his
blood
mould
cry
from
the
ground
,
to
the
Lord
his
God
,
for
vengeance
loeome
upon
thee
;
and
perhaps
thou
wowldst
lose
thy
soul
.
Yow
when
Ammon
had
said
these
words
unto
him
,
rb
ansvered
him
,
saying
:
1
know
that
if
should
slay
my
son
,
that
Ishould
shed
innocent
blood
;
for
it
is
thou
that
hast
sought
bdestroy
him
:
and
he
stretched
foril
his
hand
to
slay
Amto
.
But
Ammon
withstood
his
blows
,
and
also
smote
his
am
thatke
could
not
use
it
.
Now
when
the
king
saw
that
-
atumon
could
slay
him
,
he
began
to
plead
with
Ammon
,
that
ewould
spare
his
life
,
But
Ammon
raised
his
sword
,
and
sid
unto
him
,
Behold
,
I
will
smite
thee
,
except
thou
wilt
grant
tnlo
me
that
my
brethren
may
be
cast
out
of
prison
.
Now
the
ing
,
fearing
that
he
should
Lose
his
life
,
said
,
If
thou
wilt
spare
te
,
1
willgrant
unto
thee
whatsoever
thou
wilt
ask
,
even
te
half
of
the
kingdom
.
Now
when
Ammon
saw
that
he
had
wrought
upon
the
old
cording
to
his
desire
,
he
saith
unto
him
,
If
thou
wilt

and
that
ye
be
not

with

,
but
grant
that

may
do
according

in

,
and
-
then

the

And
when
he

and
when

in

;
for
I
greatly
desire
to

for

auivity
;
and
it
was
away
joiing
the
borders
of
Mormon
.—
Now
the
Lamanites
,
and
the
Amalekitcs
,
and
the
people
of
Amalon
,
had
built
a
great
city
,
which
was
called
Jerusalem
.
Yow
the
Lamanites
,
of
themselves
,
were
sufficiently
hardened
,
fut
the
Amalekites
,
and
the
Amulonites
,
were
still
harder
5
herefore
they
did
cause
the
Lamanites
that
they
should
harden
ier
hearts
,
that
they
should
wax
stronger
in
wickedness
,
and
{heir
abominations
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
-
Aaron
came
to
the
cily
of
Jerusalm
,
end
firstly
began
to
preach
to
the
Amalekites
.
And
he
began
to
preach
to
them
in
their
synagogues
,
for
they
had
built
smazogues
,
after
the
order
of
the
Nehors
;
for
many
of
the
Amalekites
and
the
Amulomtes
were
after
the
order
of
the
Netors
,
Therefore
,
as
Aaron
entered
into
one
of
their
synagues
to
preach
unto
the
people
,
and
as
he
was
speaking
uniothem
,
behold
there
arose
an
Amatlckitc
,
and
began
to
confend
with
him
,
saying
;
What
is
that
that
thou
hast
testified
?
fast
thou
seen
an
angel
?
Why
do
not
angels
appear
unto
wt
Behold
,
are
not
this
people
as
good
as
thy
people
?—
Thou
also
sayest
,
Except
sve
repent
,
we
shall
perish
.
How
Wowest
thou
the
thought
and
intent
of
our
heart
?
How
bnowest
thou
that
we
have
cause
to
repent
?
How
knowest
thou
that
we
are
not
a
righteous
people
?
Behold
,
we
have
bill
smetuarics
,
and
we
do
assemble
ourselves
together
to
Wrskip
God
.
We
do
believe
that
God
will
save
all
men
.
Now
Aaron
said
unto
him
,
Believest
thou
that
the
Son
of
God
shall
come
to
redeem
mankind
fro
:
n
their
sins
2
)
And
the
tin
saith
unto
him
,
We
do
not
believe
that
thou
knowest
aly
such
thing
.
We
do
not
believe
in
these
foolish
traditons
.
We'do
not
believe
that
thou
knowest
of
things
to
come
,
nelther
do
we
believe
that
thy
fathers
,
and
also
that
our
fathers
i
know
concerning
the
things
which
they
spake
,
of
that
Thich
is
to
come
.
Now
Aaron
began
to
open
the
Scriptures
unto
them
,
con@ning
the
coming
of
Christ
,
and
also
concerning
the
resurRetion
of
the
dead

came

:
Cas
he

began
to
expound
these
things
unto
them
,
they
were
with
him
,
and
began
to
mock
him
;
and
they
would

the
words
which
he
spake
;
therefore
,
when
he

they
would
not

he
departed
out
of
the
gg
gogue
,
and
vame
over
to
avillage
which
was
called

and
there
he
found'
Muloki

preaching
the
word
unto

also
Ammalh

and
his
brethren

And
they
contendedy
many
about
the
word
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
that
the
people'
would
harden
their
hearts
;
therefere
they
parted
,
and
came
over

the
land
of
Middoni

And
the
preach
the
word
unto
many
,
and
few
believed
on
the
w
which
they
taught
.
Nevertheless
,
Aaron
,
and
a
certain
r
ber
of
his

,
were
taken
and
cast
into
prison
,
atid
remainder
of

fled
out

unto

And
those

were
cast
into

suilered
many

they
were
delivered
by

Lamoni

Ammon

and
they
were
fed
and
clothed
,
they
went
forth
again
to
declare
the
word
;
and
thus
they
delivered
for
the
first
time
out
of

;
and
thus
they
suifered
.
And
they
went
forth

they
were]
by
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
,
preaching
the
word
of
God
inem
synagegue
of

assembly
of
thell

where
they
could
be
admitied

'
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
began
to
bless

somuch
that
ihey
brought
many
to

they
did
convince

And
if
came
to
pass
that
Ammon

Lamoni
returned
ng
the
land

to
the
land
of

which
was

And
king
Lamoni
would
not

that

he
cat
ed
that

and
he
caused
that

he
did
rejoice
over

he
did
teach

And
he
did
also
declare
unto
them
that

that

they
were
free

were

And
he
also
declared
unto

that

And
Ammon
did
preach
unto

it
came
to

that
he

gave

Now
as
Ammon
was
thus
teaching
the
people
of
Ianont
continually
,
we
will
return
to
the
account

of
Aaron

for
after
he

departed
from

land
of

he
was
led
by
the
spirit
to
the

he
was
the

it
came
to

that

went
in
unto
him
into

,
with

bowed
himself
before

And
it

come
to

that
when

saw
that

he
began
from

reading

how

after

And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Aaron
had
said
these
wonk
the
king
did
bow
down
before
the
Lord
,
upon
his
knees
;
7
even
he
did
prostrate
himself
upon
the
earth
,
and
cried
mit

atily
,
saying
,
O
God
;
Aaron
hath
told
me
that

may
be

and

saved
at
the
last
day
.
And
now
when
the
king
had
said
thes
:
words
,
he
was
strack
as
if
he
were
dead
.
rf
And
it
came
to
pass
that
his
servants
ran
and
told
fi}
queen
all
that
had
happened
unto
the
king

And
she

Com

that

Now
the
servants
had
seen
the
usd
of
the
king's
fall
,
therefore
they
durst
not

Therefore

Now
when

she
also
began
to

commanded

her

that

that

Now
when
Aaron
saw
fe
determination
of
the
queen

and
he
also
knowing
the

feared

there
should

therefore
he
wt
forth

raised

and
said
wis
him

Stand

and
he
stood
upon

receiving

Now
this
was
done

the
presence
of
the
queen

ad
many

And
when
they
saw
it

they
greatly
anvelled
,
and
began
to
fear

And
the
King
stood
forth

And
he
did
minister
unto

that
his

Now
there
waa
multitude
gathered
together

therebegan
to

great

And
it
came

from

towards

thus
were
the

the
Nephites
divided

Now
the

manites
lived
in
the
wilderness
,
and
dwelt
in
tents
;
and
they
were
spread
through
the
wilderness
,
on
the
west
,
in
the
layj
of
Nephi
;
yea
,
and
also
on
the
west
of
the
land
of
Zarahe
in
the
borders
,
by
the
seashore
,
and
on
the
west
,
in
the
lan
of
Nephi
,
in
the
place
of
their
fathers'
first
inheritance
;
ang
thus
bordering
along
by
the
seashore
.
And
also
there
wa
many
Lamanites
on
the
east
by
the
seashore
,
whither
the
Ne
phites
had
driven
them
.
And
thus
the
Nephites
were
ne
surrounded
by
the
Lamanites
;
nevertheless
the
Nephites
baj
taken
possession
of
all
the
northern
parts
of
the
land
,
borden
on
the
wilderness
,
at
the
head
of
the
river
Sidon
,
fo
east
to
the
west
,
round
about
on
the
wilderness
side
;
on
north
,
even
until
they
came
to
the
land
which
they
,
call
Bountiful
.
And
it
bordered
upon
the
land
which
they
ob
Desolation
;
it
being
so
far
northward
that
it
came
info
th
Jand
which
had
been
peopled
,
and
had
been
destroyed
,
a
whose
bones
we
have
spoken
,
which
was
discovered
by
te
people
of
Zarahemla
;
it
heing
the
place
of
their
first
landing
And
they
came
from
there
up
into
the
south
wilderness
.
Thus
the
land
on
the
northward
was
called
Desolation
,
and
the
lad
on
the
southward
was
called
Bountiful
;
it
being
the
wildernes
,
which
-
was
filled
with
all
manner
of
wild
animals
of
-
eveq
kind
;
a
part
of
which
had
come
from
the
land
northward
,
fe
food
.
And
now
it
was
only
the
distance
of
a
day
and
a
half
joumey
for
a
Nephite
,
on
the
Jine
Bountiful
,
and
the
land
Dee
olation
,
from
the
East
to
the
West
sea
;
and
thus
the
landd
Nephi
,
and
the
land
of
Zarahomla
,
was
nearly
surrounded
by
water
;
there
being
a
small
neck
of
land
between
thela
northward
,
and
ihe
Jand
southward
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
hed
inhabited
the
jand
Bountiful
,
even
from
the
East
unto
the
West
sea
,
aut
thus
the
Nephites
in
their
wisdom
,
with
their
guards
and
thet
armies
,
had
hemmed
in
the
Lamanites
on
the
south
,
that
there
by
they
should
have
no
more
possession
on
the
north
,
that
they
might
not
overrun
the
land
northward
;
therefore
the
Li
manites
could
have
no
more
possessions

,
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
Sait
a
proclamation
among
all
his
people
,
that
they
should
not
lay
their
hands
on
Aiomon
,
or
Aaron
,
or
Omner
,
or
Tlimni
,
wt
neithet
of
their
brethren
which
should
go
forth
preaching
the
word
of
God
,
in
whatsoever
place
they
should
be
,,
in
any
part
of
their
land
;
yea
,
he
sent
a
decree
among
them
,
that
they
should
not
lay
their
hands
on
them
to
bind
them
,
or
to

neither
should

nor
cast
them
out
of
their
synagogues

nor
scourge
them

either
should
they
cast
stones
at
them
,
but
that
they
should
have
free
access
to
their
houses
,
and
also
their
temples
,
and
their
sanctuaries
;
and
thus
they
might
go
forth
and
preach
the
ord
according
to
their
desires
,
for
the
king
had
been
conyertunto
the
Lord
,
and
all
his
household
;
therefore
.
he
sent
tis
proclamation
throughout
the
land
unte
his
people
,
that
the
void
of
God
might
have
no
obstruction
,
but
that
it
might
go
rih
throughout
all
the
land
,
that
his
people
might
be
conyinted
concerning
the
wicked
traditions
of
their
fathers
,
and
that
they
might
be
convinced
that
they
were
all
brethren

and
that
ey

,
nor
to

,
nor
to

nor

,
nor
to

iudnow
it
came
to

that
when
the

as

,
as
many
of
the
Lamanites
as
believed
j
,
their
preaching
,
and
were
converted
unto
the
Lord
,
never
dij
fall
away
,
for
they
became
a
righteous
people
;
they
did
Ig
down
the
weapons
of
their
rebellion
,
that
they
did
not
fig
against
God
no
more
,
neither
against
any
of
their
brethren
.
Now
these
are
they
which
were
converted
unto
the
Lord
:
The
people
of
the
Lamanites
which
were
in
the
land
of
Ishmael
,
and
also
of
the
people
of
the
Lamanites
which
were
in
the
Jan
of
Middoni
,
and
also
of
the
people
of
the
Lamanites
which
were
in
the
city
ef
Nephi
,
and
also
of
the
people
of
the
Laman
ites
which
were
in
the
land
of
Shilom
,
and
which
were
in
Jand
of
Shemlon
,
and
in
the
city
of
Lemucl
,
and
in
the
city
of
Shimnilom
;
and
these
are
the
names
of
the
cities
of
the
Le
Inanites
which
were
converted
unto
the
Lord
;
and
these
gr
they
that
laid
down
the
weapons
of
their
rebellion
,
yea
,
a
their
weapons
of
war
;
and
they
were
all
Lamanites
,
Ay
the
Amulekites
were
not
converted
,
save
only
one
;
neithe
was
any
of
the
Amulonites
;
but
they
did
harden
their
hears
and
also
the
hearts
of
the
Lamanites
in
that
part
of
the
lay
whithersoever
they
dwelt
;
yea
,
and
all
their
villages
and
all
te
)
Cities
;
therefore
we
have
named
all
the
cities
of
the
Lamm
ites
in
which
they
did
repent
and
come
to
the
knowledge
d
the
truth
,
and
were
converted
.
And
ow
it
came
to
.
pass
that
the
king
and
those
peopl
which
were
converted
,
were
desirous
that
they
might
haves
name
,
that
thereby
they
might
be
distinguished
from
thee
brethren
;
therefore
the
king
consulted
with
Aaron
and
mak
of
their
priests
,
concerning
the
name
that
they
should
take
won
them
,
that
they
might
be
distinguished
.
And
it
came
0
pass
that
they
called
their
name
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehies
;
and
they
were
called
by
this
name
,
and
were
no
more
called
,
Lami
ites
.
And
they
began
to
be
a
very
industrious
people
;
ya
and
they
were
friendly
with
the
Nephites
;
therefore
they
dil
Open
a
correspondence
with
them
,
and

curse
of
God

no
more

them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Amalekites
,
and
the
Amulor
ites
,
and
the
Lamanites
which
were
in
the
land
of
Amulot
,
and
also
in
the
land
of
Helam
,
and
which
was
in
the
land
d
Jerusalem
,
and
in
fine
,
in
all
the
land
round
abou'
,
which
bel
not
heen
converted
,
and
had
not
taken
upon
them
the
named
!
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
,
were
stirred
up
by
the
Amalckites
,
and
by
the
Amulonites
,
to
anger
against
their
brethren
;
and
their
ht
ired
became
exceeding
sore
against
them
,
even
insomuch
thet
[File:295]
they
began
to
rebel
against
their
king
,
insomuch
that
they
would
not
thaf
he
should
be
their
king
;
therefore
they
took
up
arms
against
the
people
of
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
.
Now
the
king
conferred
the
kingdom
upon
his
son
;
and
he
,
called
his
name
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
.
And
the
king
died
in
that
sel
-
same
year
that
the
Lamanites
began
to
make
preparation
for
war
against
the
people
of
God
.
Now
when
Ammon
and
his
brethren
,
and
al
those
which
had
come
up
with
him
,
saw
the
preparations
of
the
Lamanites
to
destroy
their
brethren
,
they
came
forth
to
the
land
of
Midian
,
and
there
Ammon
met
all
his
brethren
;
and
from
thence
they
came
to
the
land
of
Ishmael
,
that
they
might
hold
a
council
with
Lamoni
,
and
also
with
his
brother
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lebi
,
what
they
should
do
to
defend
themselves
against
the
Lamanites
.
Now
there
was
not
one
soul
among
all
the
people
which
had
been
converted
unto
the
Lerd
,
that
would
take
up
arms
against
their
brethren
;
nay
,
they
would
not
even
make
any
preparations
for
war
5
.
yea
,
and
so
their
king
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
.
Now
these
are
the
words
which
he
said
unto
the
people
concerning
the
matter
:
I
thank
my
God
,
my
beloved
People
,
that
our
great
God
has
in
goodness
sent
these
our
brethren
,
the
Nephites
,
unto
us
to
preach
unto
us
,
and
to
convince
us
of
the
Seditions
of
our
wicked
fathers
.
And
bchold
,
I
thank
my
Steal
God
that
Le
bas
given
us
a
portion
of
his
spirit
to
soften
our
hearts
,
that
we
have
opencd
a
correspondence
with
these
brethren
,
the
Nephites
;
and
behold
,
I
also
thank
my
God
that
by
opening
this
correspondence
,
we
have
been
convinced
of
Gur
sins
,
and
of
the
many
murders
which
we
have
comipitted
;
and
1
also
thank
my
God
,
yea
,
my
great
God
,
that
he
hath
granted
unto
us
that
we
might
repent
of
these
things
,
and
also
that
he
hath
forgiven
us
of
those
our
many
sins
and
murders
Which
we
have
committed
,
and
took
away
the
guilt
from
our
hearts
,
through
the
merits
of
his
Son
.
And
now
behold
,
my
brethren
,
singe
it
has
been
all
that
we
could
do
,
(
as
we
were
the
most
lost
of
all
mankind
,)
to
repent
of
all
our
sins
and
the
many
murders
which
we
have
committed
,
and
to
get
God
to
ke
then
away
from
our
hearts
,
for
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
repent
sufficiently
before
God
,
that
he
wonld
take
away
our
stain
.
Now
my
best
beloved
brethren
,
since
God
hath
taken
vay
our
stains
,
and
our
swords
have
become
bright
,
then
let
¥s
stain
our
swords
no
more
with
the
blood
of
our
brethren
.
thold
,
¥
say
unto
you
,
Nay
,
let
us
retain
our
swords
,
that
they
be
not
Stained
with
the
blood
of
our
brethren
:
for
per
[File:296]
haps
,
if
we
should
stain
our
swords
again
,
they
can
nomore
be
washed
bright
through
the
blood
of
the
Son
of
our
great
God
,
which
shall
be
shed
for
the
atonement
of
our
sins
.
And
the
great
God
has
had
mercy
on
us
,
and
made
these
things
know
,
unto
us
,
that
we
might
not
perish
;
yea
,
and
he
hath
made
these
things
known
unto
us
beforehand
,
because
he
loveth
up
souls
as
well
as
he
loveth
our
children
;
therefore
in
his
me
.
ey
he
doth
visit
us
by
his
angels
,
that
the
plan
of
salvation
might
be
made
known
unto
us
as
well
as
unto
future
gener
.
tions
.
O
how
merciful
is
our
God
!
And
now
behold
,
since
it
has
been
as
much
as
we
could
do
to
get
our
stains
taken
away
from
us
,
and
our
swords
are
made
bright
,
let
us
bide
them
away
that
they
may
be
kept
bright
,
as
a
testimony
to
ou
God
at
the
last
day
,
or
at
the
day
that
we
shall
be
brought
t
stand
before
him
to
be
judged
,
that
we
have
not
stained
ow
swords
in
the
blood
of
our
brethren
since
he
imparted
his
word
unto
us
,
and
has
made
us
clean
thereby
.
And
now
my
brethren
,
if
our
brethren
scek
to
destroy
us
,
behold
,
we
wil
hide
away
our
swords
,
yea
,
even
we
will
bury
them
deep
it
the
earth
,
that
they
may
be
kept
bright
,
as
a
testimony
the
we
have
never
used
them
,
at
the
last
day
;
and
if
our
brethren
destroy
us
,
behold
,
we
shall
go
to
our
God
,
and
shall
le
saved
.
And
new
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
king
had
made
end
of
these
sayings
,
and
all
the
people
were
assembled
to
gether
,
they
took
their
swords
,
and
all
the
weapons
whieh
were
used
for
the
shedding
of
man's
blood
,
and
they
did
buy
them
up
deep
in
the
earth
;
and
this
they
did
,
it
being
in
thei
view
a
testimony
to
God
,
and
also
to
men
,
that
they
never
uw
weapons
again
for
the
shedding
of
man's
blood
;
and
this
they
did
,
vouching
and
covenanting
with
God
,
that
rather
than
to
shed
the
blood
of
their
brethren
,
they
would
give
up
their
owa
lives
;
and
rather
than
to
take
away
from
a
brother
,
they
would
give
unto
him
;
and
rather
than
to
spend
their
days
in
idle
ness
,
they
would
labor
abundantly
with
theit
hands
;
and
thus
we
see
that
when
these
Lamanites
were
drought
to
believe
and
to
know
the
truth
,
that
they
were
firm
,
and
would
suffer
even
unto
death
,
rather
than
to
commit
sin
;
and
thus
we
set
,
that
they
buried
the
weapons
of
peace
,
or
they
buried
the
weapons
of
war
,
for
peace
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
their
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
,
made
preparations
for
war
,
and
came
up
to
the
Jand
of
Nephi
,
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
the
king
,
and
to
place
anotber
;
[File:297]
in
biz
stead
,
and
also
of
destroying
the
people
of
Anti
-
NepbiLehi
out
of
the
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
peo
{e
saw
that
they
were
coming
against
them
,
they
went
out
to
meet
them
,
and
prostrated
themselves
before
them
to
the
earth
,
and
began
to
call
on
the
name
of
the
Lord
;
and
thus
they
were
in
this
attitude
,
when
the
Lamanites
began
to
fall
upon
them
,
and
began
to
slay
them
with
the
sword
;
and
thus
,
without
meeting
any
resisfance
,
they
did
slay
a
thousand
and
fve
of
them
;
and
we
know
that
they
are
blessed
,
for
they
have
gone
to
dwell
with
their
God
.
Now
when
the
Lamaniles
saw
that
their
brethren
would
not
flee
from
the
sword
,
neither
would
they
turn
aside
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
,
but
that
they
would
lay
down
and
perish
,
and
praised
God
even
in
the
very
act
of
peerishing
under
the
sword
;
now
when
the
Lamanites
saw
this
,
they
did
forbear
from
slaying
them
;
amd
there
were
many
whose
hearis
had
swollen
in
them
for
those
of
their
brethren
who
had
fallen
under
the
sword
,
for
they
repented
of
the
things
which
they
had
done
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
threw
down
their
weapons
of
war
,
and
they
would
not
take
them
again
,
for
they
were
stung
fr
the
murders
which
they
had
committed
;
and
they
came
down
even
as
their
brethren
,
relying
upon
the
mercies
of
those
those
arms
were
lifted
to
slay
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
God
were
joined
hat
dey
by
more
than
the
number
which
had
been
slain
;
and
those
which
had
been
slain
,
were
righteous
people
;
therefore
we
have
no
reason
to
doubt
but
what
they
are
saved
.—
And
there
was
not
a
wicked
man
slain
among
them
;
but
there
Were
more
than
a
thousand
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
imith
;
thus
we
see
that
the
Lord
worketh
in
many
ways
to
the
salvation
of
his
people
.
Now
the
greatest
number
of
those
ofthe
Lamanites
which
slew
so
many
of
their
brethren
,
were
Amelekites
and
Amulonites
,
the
greatest
number
of
whom
Were
after
the
order
of
the
Nehors
.
Now
among
those
which
dined
the
people
of
the
Lord
,
there
were
none
which
were
Amalekites
or
Amulonites
,
or
which
were
of
the
order
of
Ne
1
,
but
they
were
actual
descendants
of
Laman
and
Lemuel
;
md
thus
we
can
plainly
discern
,
that
afler
a
people
has
been
ones
enlightened
by
the
spirit
of
God
,
and
hath
had
great'
oWledge
of
things
pertaining

[File:298]
And
behold
,
now
it
came
to
pass
that
(
hose
Lamanites
wer
,
more
angry
,
because
they
had
slain
their
brethren
;
therefor
they
swore
vengeance
upon
the
Nephites
;
and
they
did
no
more
attempt
to
slay
the
people
of
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
at
that
time
;
but
they
took
their
armies
and
went
over
into
the
bor
ders
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
fell
upon
the
people
which
were
in
the
land
of
Ammonihah
,
and
destroyed
them
,
And
after
that
they
had
many
battles
with
the
Nephites
,
in
the
which
they
were
driven
and
slain
;
and
among
the
Lamanites
which
were
slain
,
were
almost
all
the
seed
of
Amulon
and
his
.
brethren
,
which
were
the
priests
of
Noah
,
and
they
were
slain
by
the
hands
of
the
Nephites
;
and
the
remainder
having
fled
into
the
east
wilderness
,
and
having
usurped
the
power
and
authority
over
the
Lamanites
,
caused
,
that
many
of
the
Laman
ites
should
perish
by
fire
,
because
of
their
belief
:
for
many
of
them
,
after
having
suffered
much
loss
and
so
many
afflictions
,
they
began
to
be
stirred
up
in
remembrance
of
the
words
which
Aaron
and
his
brethren
had
preached
to
them
in
their
land
;
therefore
they
began
to
disbelieve
the
traditions
of
ther
fathers
,
and
to
believe
in
the
Lord
,
and
that
he
gave
great
power
unto
the
Nephites
;
and
thus
there
were
many
of
them
converted
in
the
wilderness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
those
rulers
which
were
the
rem
nant
of
the
children
of
Amulon
,
caused
that
they
should
br
put
to
death
,
yea
,
al
!
those
that
believed
in
these
things
.
Now
tlus
martyrdom
caused
that
many
of
their
.
bretbren
should
be
stirred
np
to
anger
;
and
there
began
to
be
contention
in
the
wilderness
;
and
the
Lamanites
began
to
hunt
the
sced
of
Am
ulon
and
his
brethren
,
and
began
to
slay
them
,
and
they
fled
into
the
east
wilderness
.
And
behold
,
they
are
hunted
,
at
this
day
,
by
the
Lamanites
:
thus
the
words
of
Abinadi
was
brought
to
pass
,
which
he
said
concerning
the
seed
of
the
priests
which
,
caused
that
he
should
suffer
death
by
fire
.
For
he
said
unto
them
,
What
ye
shall
do
unto
me
,
shall
he
a
type
of
things
come
.
And
now
,
Abinadi
was
the
first
that
suflered
death
by
fire
,
because
of
his
belief
in
God
:
now
this
is
what
he
meant
,
that
many
should
sutfer
death
by
fire
,
according
as
he
had
suffered
.
And
he
said
unto
the
priests
of
Noah
,
That
ther
seed
should
canse
many
to
be
put
to
death
,
in
the
like
manner
ax
he
was
,
and
that
they
should
be
scattered
abroad
and
slain
,
even
as
a
sheep
having
no
shepherd
is
driven
and
slain
by
wild
beasts
:
and
now
behold
,
these
words
were
verified
,
for
they
[File:299]
were
driven
by
the
Lamanites
,
and
they
were
hunted
,
and
they
were
.
sinitten
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lamanites
saw
that
they
could
not
ayerpower
the
Nephites
,
they
returned
again
to
their
own
land
;
and
many
of
them
came
over
to
dwell
in
the
land
:
of
Ishmael
and
the
tand
of
Nephi
,
and
did
join
themselves
to
the
people
of
God
,
which
was
the
people
of
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
;
ad
they
did
also
bury
their
weapons
of
war
,
according
as
their
brethren
had
,
and
they
began
to
-
be
a
righteous
people
;
and
they
did
walk
in
the
ways
of
the
Lord
,
and
did
observe
tokeep
his
commandments
,
and
his
statutes
,
yea
,
and
they
did
keep
the
law
of
Moses
:
for
it
was
expedient
that
they
should
keep
the
law
of
Moses
as
yet
,
for
it
was
not
all
fulfilled
.
But
notwithstanding
the
law
of
Moses
,
they
did
look
forward
tothe
coming
of
Christ
,
considering
that
the
law
of
Moses
was
atype
of
his
coming
,
and
believing
that
they
must
keep
those
aulward
performances
,
until
the
time
that
he
should
be
revealed
unto
them
,
Now
they
did
not
suppose
that
salvation
came
by
the
law
of
Moses
;
but
the
law
of
Moses
did
save
to
.
strengthen
their
faith
in
Christ
;
and
thus
they
did
rain
a
hope
through
faith
,
unto
eternal
salvation
,
relying
uponthe
spirit
of
prophecy
,
which
spake
of
those
things
to
come
.
And
now
behold
,
Ammon
,
and
Aaron
,
and
Omner
,
and
Humni
,
amd
their
brethren
,
did
rejoice
excvedingly
,
for
the
success
which
they
had
had'
among
the
Lamanites
,
seeing
that
the
lord
had
granted
unto
them
according
to
their
prayers
,
and
thethe
had
also
verified
his
word
unto
them
in
every
particuln
,
And
now
,
these
are
the
words
of
Ammon
to
his
breth
en
,
which
sayeth
thus
:
My
brothers
and
my
brethren
,
be

Tsay
unto
you
,
how
great
reason
have
we
to

for
culd
we
have
supposed
,
when
we
started
from
the
land
of
Zarabemla
,
that
God
would
haye
granted
unto
us
such
great
blessings

And
now

What

this
is

Behold

For

out

,
these
our

which
have
so

And
it
came
to

that
when
Ammon

Aaron
rebuked
him

saying
:
Ammen

But
Ammon
saith

behold

many

wrought

we

Behold
,
how
many
thousands
of
our

hath
he
loosed
from
the
pains
of
hell
;
and
they
are
brought
to
sing
redeeming
love
;
and
this
because
of
the
power
of
his
wort
which
is
in
us
;
therefore
have
we
not
great
reason
to
rejoice
?
Yea

we
have
reason

for
he
is
the
Most

has
loosed

Yea
,
they

they
are
encircled

unto

Do

those

have
been

ye

my

,
we
came
into

wilderness
not
with
the
intent
to
destroy
our
brethren
,
but
with
the
intent
that
perhaps
we
might
Se
some

of
their

Now
when

CHAPTER
XY
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
those
Lamanites
which
had
ane
to
war
against
the
Nephites
,
had
found
,
after
their
many
snuggles
for
to
dewtroy
thein
,
that
it
was
in
yain
to
seek
their
destruction
,
they
returned
again
to
the
land
of
Nephi
.
And
it
same
to
pass
that
the
Amalekites
,
because
of
their
loss
,
were
weeeding
angry
.
And
when
they
saw
that
they
could
not
sek
revenge
from
the
Nephites
,
they
:
began
te
stir
up
the
people
in
anger
against
?
their
brethren
,
the
people
of
.
Anti
-
Nephiidi
;
therefore
they
began
again
to
desirey
them
.
Now
this
wople
again
rufused
to
take
their
arms
,
and
they
suffered
tiemselves
to
be
slain
according
to
the
desires
of
their
cnenies
,
Now
when
Ammon
and
-
his
brethren
saw
this
work
of
destruction
.
among
those
who
they
so
dearly
beloved
,
and
mong
those
who
had
so
dearly
beloved
them
;
for
they
were
teated
as
though
they
were
angels
sent
from
God
to
save
them
ftm
everlasting
destruction
;
therefore
,
when
Ammon
and
his
brethren
saw
this
great
work
of
destruction
,
they
were
moved
wih
compassion
,
and
they
seid
unto
the
king
,
Let
us
gather
lwether
this
people
of
the
Lord
,
and
let
us
go
down
to
the
Jand
dZaraherla
,
to
our
brethren
,
the
Nephites
,
and
flee
out
cf
they
hands
of
our
enemies
,
that
we
be
not
destroyed
.
But
the
king
sith
unto
them
,
Behold
,
the
Nephites
will
destroy
us
,
because
themany
murders
and
sins
we
have
committed
against
them
,
bi
Ammon
:
saith
,
I
wil
go
and
inquire
of
the
Lord
,
and
if
he
ith
unto
us
,
Go
down
unto
our
brethren
,
Will
ye
go
?
And
teking
saith
unto
him
Yea
;
ifthe
Lord
saith
unto
us
Go
,
we
till
godoywn
unto
our
brethren
,
and
we
will
be
their
slaves
til
we
repair
unto
them
the
many
murders
and
sins
which
We
have
committed
against
them
.
But
Ammon
saith
unio
bim
,
is
against
the
law
of
our
brethren
,
which
was
established
Fy
father
,
that
there
should
be
any
slaves
among
them
;
Werefore
let
us
go
.
down
and
rely
upon
the
mercies
of
our
Yretimen
,
But
the
king
saith
unto
him
,
Inquire
of
the
Lord
,
ind
ifhe
saith
unto
us
Go
,
we
will
go
;
otherwise
we
will

,
[File:304]
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Ammon
went
and
inquired
of
the
Lord
,
and
the
Lord
said
unto
him
,
Get
this
people
out
of
this
land
,
that
they
perish
not
,
for
Satan
hath
great
hold
on
th
hearts
of
the
Amalckites
,
which
do
stir
up
the
Lamanites
,
anger
against
their
brethren
,
to
slay
them
;
therefore
got
thy
out
of
this
land
;
and
blessed
art
this
people
in
this
generation
:
for
1
wil
!
preserve
them
.
:
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Ammon
went
and
told
th
king
all
the
words
which
the
Lord
had
said
unto
him
.
And
;
came
to
pass
that
they
gathered
tcgether
all
their
people
;
Yea
,
all
the
people
of
the
Lord
,
and
did
gather
together
all
the
flocks
and
herds
,
and
departed
out
of
the
land
,
and
came
iny
the
wilderness
which
divided
the
land
of
Nephi
from
the
lj
of
Zarahemla
,
and
came
over
near
the
borders
of
the
land
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Ammon
saith
unto
them
,
Behold
Zand
my
brethren
will
go
forth
into
the
land
of
Zarehenh
,
and
ye
shall
remain
here
until
we
return
;
and
we
will
try
the
hearts
of
our
brethren
,
whether
they
will
that
ye
shall
com
into
their
land
.
;
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
Ammon
was
going
forth
into
tle
land
,
that
he
and
his
brethren
met
Alma
,
over
in
the
placed
which
has
been
spoken
;
and
behold
,
this
was
a
joyful
me
:
ing
.
Now
the
joy
of
Ammon
was
so
great
,
even
that
he
wa
full
;
yea
,
he
was
swallowed
up
in
the
joy
of
his
God
,
even
the
exhausting
of
hisstrength
;
and
he
fell
again
to
the
eard
,
Now
was
not
this
exceeding
joy
?
.
Behotd
,
this
is
joy
whit
none
receiveth
save
it
he
the
truly
penitent
and
humble
seeke
of
happiness
.
Now
the
joy
of
Alma
in
meeting
his
brethe
was
truly
great
,
and
also
the
joy
of
Aaron
,
of
Omner
,
al
Himni
;
but
behold
,
their
joy
was
not
that
to
exceed
thei
strength
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
conducted
his
brethrar
back
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
even
to
his
own
house
.
Atl
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
and
told
the
Chief
Judge
all
de
things
that
had
happened
unto
them
in
the
land
of
Nephi
amoy
their
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Chief
Judge
sent
a
proclame
tion
throughout
all
the
land
,
desiring
the
voice
of
the
people
concerning
the
admitting
their
brethren
,
which
were
the
people
of
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
yoice
of
it
people
came
,
saying
,
Behold
,
we
will
give
up
the
land
of
Jer
shon
,
which
is
on
the
east
by
the
sea
,
which
joins
the
land
,
Bountifal
,
which
is
on
the
south
of
the
land
Bountiful
;
and
[File:305]
is
land
Jershon
is
the
land
which
we
will
give
unto
our
brethyn
,
for
an
inheritance
.
And
behold
,
we
will
sci
our
armics
jetween
the
land
Jershon
and
the
land
Nephi
,
that
-
we
may
fect
our
brethren
in
the
land
Jershon
;
and
this
we
do
for
our
brethren
,
on
account
of
their
fear
to
take
up
arms
against
her
brethren
,
lest
they
should
commit
sin
;
and
this
their
great
jareame
,
because
of
their
sore
repentance
which
they
had
,
maccount
of
their
many
murders
,
and
thuir
awful
wickedness
.
$od
now
behold
,
this
will
we
do
unto
onr
brethren
,
that
they
my
mherit
the
land
Jershon
;
and
we
will
guard
tiem
from
her
enemies
with
our
armics
,
on
conditions
that
they
will
give
isa
portion
of
their
substance
Lo
assist
s
,
that
we
may
mainfin
our
armies
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Ammon
had
heard
this
,
he
atuaied
to
the
people
of
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
,
znd
also
Alma
with
im
,
into
the
wilderness
,
where
they
had
pitched
their
tents
,
al
made
known
unto
them
all
these
things
.
And
Alma
also
mated
unto
them
his
conversion
with
Ammon
,
and
Aaron
,
and
lisbrethren
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
it
did
cause
great
joy
among
them
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
down
into
ieland
of
Jershon
,
and
took
possession
of
the
land
of
Jerton
;
and
they
were
called
by
the
Nephites
the
people
of
Amnon
;
therefore
they
were
distinguished
by
that
name
ever
iter
;
and
they
were
among
the
people
of
Nephi
,
and
also
tumdered
among
the
people
which
were
of
the
Church
of
God
.
And
they
were
also
distinguished
for
their
zeal
towards
God
,
mt
also
towards
men
;
for
they
were
perfectly
honest
and
tight
in
all
things
;
and
they
were
firm
in
the
faith
of
Christ
,
wnuato
the
end
.
And
they
did
look
upon
shedding
the
blood
their
brethren
with
the
greatest
abhorrence
;
and
they
never
wuld
be
prevailed
upon
to
take
up
arms
against
their
brethren
;
al
they
never
did
look
upon
death
with
any
degrce
of
terror
Ortheiy
hope
and
views
of
Chnist
anil
the
resurrection
;
therefre
death
was
swallowed
up
to
them
by
the
victory
of
Christ
Werit
;
therefore
they
would
suffer
death
in
the
most
ageratding
and
distressing
manner
which
could
be
inflicted
by
their
lhren
,
before
they
would
take
the
sword
or
the
cimeter
to
tite
them
.
And
thus
they
were
a
zealous
and
beloved
peote
ahighly
favored
people
of
the
Lord
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
people
of
Ammon
Yete
established
in
the
land
of
Jershon
,
and
a
church
also
Stiblished
im
the
land
of
Jcrshon
;
and
the
armies
of
the
No

Were
set
round
about
the
land
of
Jershon
;
yea
,
in
all
[File:306]
the
borders
round
about
the
land
of
Zarahemla
:
behold
mies
of
the
Lamanites
had
followed
their
brethren
into
they
derness
.
And
thus
a
tremendous
battle
;
yea
,
CVen
such
one
as
never
had
been
known
among
all
the
people
in
the
laa
fron
the
time
Lehi
lefi
Jerusalem
;
yea
,
and
tensof
thousand
of
the
Lumaniies
were
slain
and
scattered
abroad
.
”
Yea
,
gy
also
there
was
a
tremendous
slaughter
among
the'
people
g
Nephi
;
nevertheless
;
the
Lamanites
were
driven
and
seutyy
,
ed
,
and
the
people
of
Nephi
returned
again
to
their
lando
And
now
.
this
was
a
time
that
there
was
a
great
mourning
gg
lamentation
heard
throughout
all
the
land
,
among
all
the
peo
ple
of
Nephi
;
yea
,
the
cry
of
widows
mourning
for
theit
hy

bands
,
and
also
of
fathers
mourning
for
their
sons
,
and
th
daughter
for
the
brother
;
yea
,
the
brother
forthe
father
:
a
thus
the
cry
of
mourning
was
heard
among
every
one
of
then
;
mourning
for
their
kindred
which
had
been
slain
.
And
foy
surely
this
was
a'sorrowful
day
;
yea
,
a
time
of
solemnity
,
a
atime
of
much
fasting
and
prayer
:
and
thus
ended
the
&
teenth
year
cf
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Ne
phi
;
and
this
is
the
account
of
Ammon
and
his
brethren
,
thi
Journeyings
in
the
Tand
of
Nephi
,
their
sufferings
in
the
fait
their
sorrows
,
and
their
afllictions
,
and
their
incomprehensite
joy
,
and
the
reception
and
safety
of
the
brethren
in
the
lal
of
Jershon
,
And
now
may
the
Lord
,
the
Redeemer
of
all
ite
,
bless
their
souls
forever
.
And
thia
is
the
account
of
the
way
and
contentions
among
the
Nephites
,
and
also
the
wars
le
tween
the
Nephites
and
the
Lamanites
;
and
the
fifteenth
yer
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
is
ended
;
and
from
the
first
yeart
the
fifteenth
,
has
brought
to
pass
the
destruction
of
many
thot
sand
lives
;
yea
,
it
has
brought
to
pass
an
awful
scene
of
blook
shed
;
and
the
bodies
of
many
thousands
are
laid
low
inte
earth
,
while
the
bodies
of
many
thousands
are
mouldering
it
heaps
upon
the
face
of
de
carth
;
yea
,
and
many
thousanle
are
mourning
for
ihe
loss
of
their
kindred
,
because
they
hat
reason
to
fear
,
according
to
the
promises
of
the
Lord
,
that
they
are
consigned
to
a
slate
of
endless
wo
;
while
many
thousanis
of
others
truly
mourn
for
the
loss
of
their
kindred
,
yet
they
rejoice
and
exult
in
the
hope
,
and
even
know
,
according
tolie
promises
.
of
the
Lord
,
that
they
are
raised
to
dwell
at
the
Tigit
hand
of
God
,
in
a
state
of
never
ending
happiness
:
and
thi
we
see
how
great
the
inequality
of
man
is
because
of
sinal
tronsgression
,
and
the
power
of
the
Devil
,
which
comes
by
tit
cunning
plais
which
he
hath
devised
to
ensnare
the
hearts

;
and
-
thus
we
see
the
great
call
:
of
diligence
of
men
to
jbor
in
the
vineyards
of
the
Lord
;
and
thus
we
see
the
great
qeason
of
sorrow
,
and
also
of
rejoicing
+
sorrow
because
of
death
and
destruction
among
men
,
and
because
of
the
Jight
of

also
after

days
of

,
and

,
(
and
it
was
in

st

of

there

for
they
were

law
of

,
untilit
should
be
fulfilled
;
and
tus
the
people
did
have
vo
disturbance
in
all
the
sixteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
[File:309]
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventeenth
ycar
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
,
there
was
continual
peace
.
But
itcame
to
pass
in
the
latter
end
of
the
seventeenth
year
,
there
came
a
man
snto
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
and
he
was
Anti
-
Christ
,
for
he
pegan
to
preach
unto
the
people
against
the
prophecies
which
had
been
spoken
by
ihe
prophets
,
concerning
the
coming
of
Christ
.
Now
there
was
no
law
against
a
man's
belief
;
for
it
was
elictly
contrary
to
the
connaangs
of
God
,.
that
there
should
be
a
law
which
should
bring
men
on
to
unequal
grounds
.
Por
thus
sait
the
Scripture
:
Choose
ye
this
day
,
whom
ye
wil
serve
.
Now
if
a
man
desired
to
serve
God
,
it
was
his
pavilege
,
or
rather
if
he
believed
in
God
,
it
was
his
privilege
teserve
bim
;
but
if
he
did
not
believe
in
him
,
there
was
no
law
to
punish
him
.
.
Butif
he
murdered
,
he
was
punished
unto
death
;
and
if
he
robbed
,
he
was
also
,
punished
;
and
if
he
stole
,
he
was
also
punished
;
and
if
he
committed
adultery
,
he
was
algo
punished
;
yea
,
for
all
this
wickedness
,
they
were
punished
:
for
there
was
a
law
,
that
men
should
be
judged
weording
to
their
crimes
.
Nevertheless
,
there
was
no
law
gainst
a
man's
belief
;
therefore
,
a
man
was
punished
only
for
the
crimes
which
he
had
donc
;
therefore
all
men
were
on
equal
grounds
.
And
this
Anti
-
Christ
,
whose
name
was
Korihor
,
and
the
law
could
have
no
hold
upon
him
.
And
he
begui
to
preach
unto
the
people
,
that
there
should
be
no
Christ
.
And
er
this
manner
did
he
preach
,
saying
:
O
ye
that
are
hound
down
under
a
foolish
and
a
vain
hope
,
why
do
ye
voke
yourselves
with
such
foolish
things
?
Why
do
ye
look
for
a
Christ
?
For
no
man
can
know
of
any
thing
which
is
.
to
come
.
Behold
,
these
things
which
ye
call
prophecies
,
which
ye
say
ae
handed
down
by

prophets
,
behold
,
they
are

of

How
do
ye

of

?
Beliold
,
ye
cannot
know
of

therefore
ye

this
people
,
testifying
unto
thm
there
is
no
God
.
And
yet
will
ye
deny
against
all
these
wi
nesses
?
And
he
said
,
Yea
,
J
will
deny
,
except
ye
shall
she
me
a
sign
.
1
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
said
unto
him
,
Behold
Tam
grieved
because
of
the
hardness
of
your
heart
;
yea
,
tli
!
ye
will
still
resist
the
spirit
of
the
iruth
,
that
thy
soul
mayl
destroyed
.
But
behold
,
it
is
better
that
thy
soul
should
lost
,
than
that
thou
shouldst
be
the
means
of
bringing
may
souls
down
to
destruction
,
by
thy
lying
and
by
thy
flatter
words
;
therefore
if
thou
shalt
deny
again
,
behold
,
God
shi
smite
thee
,
that
thou
shalt
become
dumb
,
that
thou
sbaltze
ver
open
thy
mouth
any
more
,
that
thou
shalt
not
deceit
?
this
people
any
more
.
Now
Korihor
saith
unto
him
,
I
dom
deny
the
existence
of
a
God
,
but
I
do
not
believe
that
there'
a
God
;
and
I
say
also
,
that
ye
do
not
know
that
there
is4
God
;
and
except
ye
shew
me
a
sign
,
I
will
not
believe
.
Nor
Alma
saith
unto
him
,
This
will
I
give
unto
thee
fora
si
that
thou
shalt
be
struck
dumb
,
according
to
my
words
;
J
say
,
tbat
in
the
name
ef
God
,
that
ye
shall
be
struck
dumh
[File:313]
that
ye
shail
no
more
have
utterance
.
Now
when
Alma
had
sid
these
W
ords
,
Korihor
was
struck
dumb
,
that
he
could
not
jave
utterance
,
according
to
the
words
of
Alma
.
And
now
hen
the
Chief
Judge
saw
this
,
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
wrote
unto
Korihor
,
saying
:
Art
thou
convinced
of
the
power
ofa
God
?
In
whom
did
ye
desire
that
Alma
should
shew
forth
jis
sign
?
Would
ye
that
he
should
afflict
others
,
to
shew
unjo
iiee
a
sign
?
Behold
,
he
hath
showed
unto
you
a
sign
;
and
wow
,
will
ye
dispute
more
t
And
Koriher
put
forth
his
band
,
and
wrote
,
saying
:
I
know
that
Lam
dumb
,
for
I
cannot
speak
;
iad]
know
that
nothing
,
save
it
were
the
power
of
God
,
could
bring
this
upon
me
;
yea
,
and
Talso
knew
that
there
was
a
God
,
But
behotd
,
the
Devil
hath
deceived
me
;
for
he
apgered
unto
me
in
the
form
of
an
angel
,
and
said
unto
me
,
Go
.
adreclaim
this
people
,
for
they
have
all
gone
astray
after
an
wrnowr
God
.
And
he
saith
unto
me
,
There
is
no
God
;
yea
,
and
he
taught
me
that
which
I
should
say
.
And
1
have
fight
his
words
;
and
{
taught
them
,
because
they
were
pleasig
upto
the
carnal
mind
;
and
J
taught
them
,
even
until
I
had
much
success
,
insomuch
that
I
verily
believed
that
they
were
we
;
and
for
this
cause
,
]
withstood
the
truth
,
even
until
I
lave
brought
this
great
curse
upon
me
.
Now
when
he
had
sid
this
)
he
besought
that
Alma
should
pray
unto
God
,
that
hecurse
might
be
taken
from
him
,
But
Alma
said
unto
him
,
Wikis
curse
should
be
taken
from
thee
,
thou
wouldst
again
ludayay
the
hearts
of
this
people
;
therefore
,
it
shall
be
un]
thee
,
even
as
the
Lord
will
.
Andit
came
to
pass
that
the
curse
was
not
taken
off
of
Kothor
;
but
he
was
cast
out
,
and
went
about
from
house
to
house
,
a
begging
for
his
food
.
Now
the
knowledge
of
what
hat
happened
unto
Korihor
,
was
immediately
published
throughout
ail
the
land
;
yea
,
the
proclamation
was
sent
forth
bythe
Chief
Judge
,
to
all
the
people
in
the
land
,
declaring
untothose
who
had
believed
in
the
words
of
Korihor
,
that
they
tiust
speedily
repent
,
lest
the
same
judgments
would
come
unto
them
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
all
convinced
of
the
Wickedness
of
Korihor
;
therefore
they
were
all
converted
Sin
unto
the
Lord
;
and
this
put
an
end
to
the
iniquity
after
©
he
manner
-
of
Korihor
.
And
Korihor
did
go
about
from
house
Shouse
,
a
begging
food
for
his
support
.
And
il
came
to
pass
that
as
he
went
forth
among
the
people
,
Ye
,
among
a
people
which
had
separated
themselves
from
the
[File:314]
Nephites
,
and
called
themselves
Zoramites
,
being
led
bya
man
whose
name
was
Zoram
;
and
as
he
went
forth
among
them
,
behold
,
he
was
run
upon
,
and
trodden
down
,
even
ugg
he
was
dead
;
and
thus
we
sce
the
end
of
him
who
pervert
the
ways
of
the
Lord
;
and
thus
we
see
that
the
Devil
will
ne
support
his
children
at
the
last
day
,
but
doth
speedily
drag
them
down
to
hell
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
end
of
Koribor
,
Alm
having
received
tidings
that
the
Zoramites
were
perverting
the
ways
of
the
Lord
,
and
that
Zoram
,
which
was
their
leade
,
was
leading
the
hearts
of
the
people
to
bow
down
to
duh
idols
,
&e
.,
his
heart
again
began
to
sicken
,
because
of
the
ig
.
qmity
of
the
people
;
for
it
was
the
cause
of
great
sorrow
Alma
,
to
know
of
iniquity
among
his
people
;
therefore
bs
heart
was
exceeding
sorrowful
,
hecause
of
the
separation
if
the
Zoramites
from
the
Nephites
.
Now
the
Zoramites
hal
gathered
themselves
together
in
a
land
which
they
called
a1
tioaum
,
which
was
east
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
which
iy
nearly
bordering
upon
the
seashore
,
which
was
south
af
tk
land
of
Jershon
,
which
also
bordered
upon
the
wildemes
south
,
which
wilderness
was
full
of
the
Lamanites
.
Now
te
Nephites
greatly
feared
that
the
Zoramites
would
enter
into
:
correspondence
with
the
Lamanites
,
and
that
it
would
he
the
means
of
great
loss
on
the
part
of
the
Nephites
.
And
nom
,
as
the
preaching
of
the
word
had
a
great
tendency
to
lead
tk
people
to
do
that
which
was
just
;
yea
,
it
had
had
more
pon
ful
eflect
upon
the
minds
of
the
people
than
the
sword
,
or
amy
thing
else
,
which
had
happened
unto
them
;
therefore
Alm
thought
it
was
expedient
that
they
should
try
the
virtee
of
the
word
of
God
.
Therefure
he
took
Ammon
,
and
Aeron
,
al
Omner
;
and
Himni
he
did
leave
in
the
church
in
Zarahuml
but
the
former
three
he
took
with
him
,
and
also
Amulek
ant
Zeezrom
,
which
were
at
Melek
;
and
he
aleo
tool
:
two
of
lis
sons
.
Now
the
cldest
of
his
sons
he
took
not
with
him
;
aul
his
name
was
Helaman
;
but
the
names
of
those
which
kt
took
with
him
,
were
Shiblon
and
Corianton
:
and
these
at
the
names
of
those
which
went
with
him
among
the
Zoramiies
to
preach
unto
them
the
word
.
Now
the
Zoramites
were
dissenters
from
the
Nephites
;
therefore
they
had
the
word
of
God
preached
unto
them
.
But
they
had
fell
into
great
errors
,
for
they
would
not
oliserve
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
his
statetes
,
according
1o
the
law
of
Moses
;
neither
would
they
observe
the
perfom
[File:315]
wees
of
the
church
,
to
continue
in
prayer
and
supplication
to
God
daily
,
that
they
might
not
enter
into
temptation
;
yea
,
in
ine
,
they
did
pervert
the
ways
of
the
Lord
in
very
many
inances
;
thereforc
,
for
this
cause
,
Alma
and
his
brethren
went
jato
the
land
,
to
preach
the
word
unto
them
.
Now
when
they
had
come
into
the
land
,
behold
,
to
their
asjishment
,
they
found
that
the
Zoramites
had
built
synagogues
,
and
that
they
did
gather
themselves
together
on
one
day
of
the
week
,
which
day
they
did
call
the
day
of
the
Lord
;
md
they
did
worship
after
a
manner
which
Alma
and
bis
brethren
had
never
beheld
;
for
they
had
a
place
built
up
in
the
cenire
of
their
synagogue
,
a
place
of
standmg
,
which
was
high
above
the
head
;
and
the
top
thereof
would
only
admit
oue
person
.
Therefore
,
whosoever
desired
to
worship
,
must
go
forth
and
stand
upon
the
top
thereof
,
and
stretch
forth
his
lands
towards
heaven
,
and
cry
with
aloud
voice
,
saying
:
Hojj
,
holy
God
;
we
believe
that
thou
art
God
,
and
we
believe
that
thou
art
holy
,
and
that
thou
wast
a
spirit
,
and
that
thou
ata
spirit
,
and
that
thou
wilt
bea
spirit
forever
.
Holy
God
,
yebelieve
that
thou
hast
separated
us
from
our
brethren
;
and
vedo
not
believe
in
the
tradition
of
our
brethren
,
which
was
landed
down
to
them
by
the
childishness
of
their
fathers
;
lit
we
believe
that
thou
hast
elected
us
to
be
thy
holy
children
;
and
also
thou
hast
made
it
known
unto
us
that
there
shall
be
no
Christ
;
but
thou
art
the
same
,
yesterday
,
to-day
,
wd
forever
;
and
thou
hast
clecied
us
,
that
we
shall
besaved
,
whilst
all
around
us
are
elected
to
be
cast
by
thy
wrath
down
tohell
;
for
the
which
holiness
,
O
God
,
we
thank
thee
;
and
we
also
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
elected
us
,
that
we
may
not
teled
away
after
the
foolish
traditions
of
our
brethren
,
which
doth
bind
them
down
to
a
belief
of
Christ
,
which
doth
lead
their
hearts
to
wander
far
from
thee
,
our
God
.
And
again
:
Wethank
thee
,
O
God
,
that
we
are
a
chosen
and
a
holy
people
.
Amen
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Alma
and
his
brethren
,
and
lis
sons
,
had
heard
these
prayers
,
they
were
astonished
beyoud
all
measure
.
For
behold
,
every
man
did
go
forth
and
-
ofier
up
the
same
prayers
.
Now
the
place
was
called
by
them
Rameumptom
,
which
being
interpreted
,
is
the
Ioly
Stand
.—
Yow
from
this
stand
,
they
did
offer
up
,
every
man
,
the
selfame
prayer
unto
God
,
thanking
their
God
that
they
were
—
chosen
of
him
,
and
that
he
did
not
lead
them
away
after
the
tradition
of
their
brethren
;
and
that
their
hearts
were
not
[File:316]
stolen
away
to
believe
in
things
to
come
,
which
they
knew
nothing
about
.
7
Now
after
the
people
had
all
offered
up
thanks
after
thy
tmanner
,
they
returned
to
their
homes
,
never
speaking
of
they
God
again
,
until
they
had
assembled
themselves
together
again
,
to
the
holy
stand
,
to
offer
up
thanks
after
their
manner
,
Now
when
Alma
saw
this
,
his
heart
was
grieved
:
for
he
saw
that
they
were
a
wicked
and
a
perverse
people
;
yea
,
he
saw
typ
their
heavts
were
vet
upon
gold
,
and
upon
silver
,
and
upon
al}
manner
of
fine
gonds
.
Yea
,
and
he
also
saw
that
their
hearty
were
lifted
up
unto
great
kousting
,
in
their
pride
.
And
tp
difted
up
his
voiee
to
Heaven
,
and
cried
,
saying
:
O
how
lon
O
Lord
,
wilt

Now
it
cameto
pass
,
that
when
Alma
had
said
these
words
,
athe
clappe
?
his
hands
upon
all
they
which
were
with
his
.
And
behold
,
.
2s
he
clapped
his
hands
upon
them
,
they
were
filed
with
the
holy
Spirit
,
And
after
that
,
they
did
separate
hemvelves
one
from
another
,
taking
no
thought
for
themselves
phat
they
should
eat
,
or
what
they
should
drink
,
or
what
they
gould
put
on
.
And
the
Lord
provided
for
them
that
they
ould
hunger
not
,
neither
should
they
thirst
;
yca
,
and
he
ikogave
them
strength
,
that
they
should
sufferno
manner
of
iflictions
,
save
it
were
swallowed
up
in
the
joy
of
Christ
,—
Now
this
was
according
to
the
prayer
of
Alma
;
and
this
,
because
he
prayed
in
faith
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
go
forth
,
and
began
to
preach
ihe
word
of
God
unto
the
people
,
entering
into
their
,
smagogues
,
and
into
their
houses
;
yea
,
and
even
they
did
peach
the
word
in
their
streets
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
der
much
labor
emong
them
,
they
began
to
have
success
among'the
poor
class
of
people
;
for
behold
,
they
were
cast
aitof
the
synagogues
,
because
of
the
coarseness
of
their
ap
pre
;
therefore
they
were
not
permitted
to
enter
into
their
smazogues
to
worship
God
,
being
ceteemed
as
filthiness
;
therefore
they
were
poor
;
yea
,
they
were
esteemed
by
their
hethren
as
dross
;
therefore
they
were
poor
as
to
things
of”
te
world
;
and
also
they
were
poor
in
heart
.
Now
as
Alma
was
teaching
and
speaking
unto
the
peopic
.
wpon
the
hill
Onidah
,
there
came
a
great
multitude
unto'him
,
which
were
those
of
which
we
have
been
speaking
,
of
whieh
Were
poor
in
heart
,
because
of
their
poverty
as
to
the
things
of
te
world
.
And
they
came
unto
Alma
;
and
the
one
which
was
the
most
foremost
among
them
,
saith
unto
him
,
Behold
.
That
shall
these
my
brethren
do
,
for
they
are
despised
of
all
nen
,
hecause
of
their
poverty
;
yea
,
and
more
especially
by
our
priests
;
for
they
have
east
us
out
of
our
synagogues
,
Which
we
have
labored
abundantly
to
build
,
with
our
own
hands
;
and
they
have
cast
us
out
becanse'of
this
our
exceed
,
ing
poverty
,
that
we
have
no
place
to
worship
our
God
;
and
behold
,
what
shall
we
do
?
And
now
when
Alma
heard
this
,
te
tumed
him
about
,
his
face
immediately
towards
him
,
and
he
beheld
,
with
great
joy
;
for
he
beheld
that
their
alllictions
had
truly
humbled
them
,
and
that
they
were
in
a
preparation
:
[File:318]
io
hear
the
word
;
therefore
he
did
say
no
more
to
the
othe
.
multitude
,
but
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
,
and
cried
unto
those
which
he
beheld
,
which
were
truly
penitent
,
and
saith
unto
them
,
I
behold
that
ye
are
lowly
in
heart
;
and
if
%
,
blessed
are
ye
.
Behold
,
thy
brother
hath
Said
,
What
.
shal}
we
do
?
for
we
are
cast
out
of
our
synagogues
,
that
we
cay
.
not
worship
our
God
.
Behold
I
say
unto
you
,
Do
ye
Suppose
that
ye
cannot
worship
God
,
saye
it
be
in
your
synagogues
only
?
Aud
moreover
,
I
would
ask
,
Do
ye
suppose
that
ye
must
not
worship
God
only
once
in
a
week
?
Tsay
unto
you
,
Itis
wa}
that
ye
are
cast
out
of
your
synagogues
,
that
ye
may
be
hum
dle
,
and
that
ye
nay
learn
wisdom
;
for
it
is
necessary
the
ye
should
learn
wisdom
,
for
it
is
because
that
ye
are
cast
ou
,
that
ye
are
despised
of
your
brethren
;
because
of
your
ey
ceeding
poverty
,
thai
ye
are
brought
to
a
lowliness
of
heart
;
'
for
ye
are
necessarily
brought
to
be
hamble
.
And
now
be
.
cause
ye
are
compellcd
to
be
humble
,
blessed
are
ye
;
forg
man
sometimes
,
if
he
is
compelled
to
be
humble
,
seeketh
rp
.
peniance
;
and
now
surely
,
whosoever
repenteth
,
shall
find
mercy
;
and
he
that
findeth
mercy
and
cndureth
to
the
ent
,
the
same
shall
be
saved
.
And
now
as
I
said
unto
you
,
Tha
because
ye
were
compelled
to
be
humble
,
ye
were
blessed
,
do
ye
nol
suppose
that
they
are
more
blessed
who
truly
bunhie
themselves
because
of
the
word
?
Yea
,
he
that
truly
bum
bleth
himself
,
and
repenteth
of
his
sins
,
and
endureth
to
the
end
,
the
same
shall
be
blessed
;
yea
,
much
more
blessed
than
they
who
art
compelled
to
be
humble
,
because
of
their
exceciing
poverty
;
therefore
blessed
are
they
who
humbleth
them
selves
without
being
compelled
to
be
bumble
;
or
rather
,
in
,
other
words
,
blessed
is
he
that
believeth
in
the
word
of
God
,
and
is
haptized
without
stubborness
of
heart
;
yea
,
without
being
brought
to
know
the
word
,
or
even
compelled
to
know
,
before
they
will
believe
.
Yea
,
there
are
many
which
do
say
,
Mf
thou
wilt
show
unto
us
a
sign
from
Heaven
,
then
we
shall
know
ofa
surety
;
then
we
shall
believe
.
Now]
ask
,
Is
this
faith
?
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
Nay
;
for
if
a
man
knowetha
thing
,
he
hath
no
cause
to
believe
,
for
he
knoweth
it
.
And
now
,
how
much
more
cursed
is
he
that
knoweth
the
will
of
God
and
docth
it
not
,
than
he
that
only
believeth
,
or
only
hath
cause
to
believe
,
and
falleth
into
transgression
?
Now
of
this
thing
,
ye
must
judge
.
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
That
it
is
on
the
on
hand
,
even
as
itis
on
the
other
;
and
it
shall
be
unto
evay
manaccording
to
his
work
.
[File:319]
And
now
as
I
said
concerning
faith
:
Faith
,
is
not
to
have
a
rfect
knowledge
of
things
;
therefore
if
ye
have
faith
,
ye
hope
for
things
which
is
not
seen
,
which
are
true
.
And
now
,
behold
,
Tsay
unto
you
:
and
J
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
God
is
merciful
unto
all
who
believe
on
his
name
;
therefore
he
desireth
,
in
the
first
place
,
that
ye
should
believe
,
yea
,
even
on
his
word
.
And
now
,
he
imparteth
his
word
by
angels
,
unto
men
;
yea
,
not
only
men
,
but
women
also
.
Now
fhix
is
not
all
:
little
children
doth
have
words
given
unto
them
many
times
,
which
doth
confound
the
wise
and
the
learned
.
And
now
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
as
ye
have
desired
to
know
of
me
what
ye
shall
do
because
ye
are
afflicted
and
cast
out
:
now
Ido
not
desire
that
ye
should
suppose
that
I
mean
to
jndge
you
only
according
to
that
which
is
true
;
for
I
do
not
mean
that
ye
all
of
you
have
been
compelled
to
humble
yourelves
;
for
I
verily
believe
there
are
some
among
you
which
would
humble
themselves
,
let
them
be
in
whatsoever
circmmnsancesthey
might
.
Now
as
I
said
concerning
faith
—
that
it
was
nota
perfect
knowledge
,
even
so
it
is
with
my
words
.
Ye
cannot
know
of
their
surety
at
first
,
unto
:
perfection
,
any
more
than
fith
is
a
perfect
knowledge
.
But
behold
,
if
ye
will
awake
and
arouse
your
faculties
,
even
to
an
experiment
upon
my
words
,
and
exercise
a
particle
of
faith
;
yea
,
evenif
ye
can
no
more
than
desire
to
betieve
,
let
this
desire
work
in
you
,
even
until
ye
believe
in
a
manner
that
ye
can
give
place
for
a
portion
of
my
words
.
Now
we
will
compare
the
word
unto
a
sed
.
Now
if
ye
give
place
,
that
a
seed
may
be
planted
in
your
heart
,
behold
,
if
it
be
a
true
seed
,
or
a
good
sced
,
if
ye
do
not
cast
it
out
by
your
unbelicf
,
that
.
ye
will
resist
the
spirit
ofthe
Lord
,
behold
,
it
will
begin
to
swell
withirl
your
breasts
;
and
when
you
feel
these
swelling
motions
,
ye
will
begin
to
say
within
yourselves
,
It
must
needs
be
that
this
is
a
good
seed
,
orthat
the
word
is
good
,
for
it
beginneth
to
enlarge
my
soul
;
yea
,
it
beginneth
to
enlighten
my
understanding
;
yea
,
and
it
beginueth
to
he
delicious
to
me
.
Now
behold
,
would
not
this
increase
your
faith
?
I
say
unto
you
,
yea
;
nevertheless
it
hath
tot
grown
up
to
a
perfect
knowledge
.
But
behold
,
as
the
seed
swelleth
,
and
sprouteth
,
and
beginneth
to
grow
,
and
ther
.
ye
must
needs
say
,
That
the
sced
is
good
;
for
behold
it
swellath
,
and
sprouteth
,
and
begimcth
to
grow
.
And
uow
behold
,
ate
ye
sure
that
this
is
a
good
seed
?
I
say
unto
you
,
Yea
;
for
every
seed
bringeth'
forth
unto
its
own
likeness
;
therefore
,
if
a
seed'
groweth
,
it
is
good
,
but
if
it
groweth
not
,
he
[File:320]
hold
,
if
is
not
good
;
therefore
it
is
cast
away
.
And
now
he
Lold
,
because
ye
have
tried
the
experiment
,
and
planted
the
seed
,
and
it
swelleth
,
and
sprouteth
,
and
beginncth
to
erom
,
ye
must
needs
know
that
the
seed
is
good
.
And
now
behold
,
is
your
knowledge
perfect
?
Yea
,
your
knowledge
is
perteg
in
that
thing
,
and
your
fuith
is
dormant
;
and
this
because
you
know
;
for
ye
know
that
the
word
hath
swelled
your
souls
and
ye
also
kmow
that
it
hath
sprouled
up
,
that
your
undep
standing
doth
begin
to
be
enlightened
,
and
your
mind
doth
be
gin
to
expand
.
©
then
,
is
not
this
real
?
I
say
unto
you
yea
;
because
it
is
ight
;
and
whatsoever
is
light
,
is
good
,
be
.
cause
it
is
discernible
;
therefore
ye
must
know
that
it
is
good
,
And
now
behold
,
after
ye
have
tasted
this
light
,
is
your
kuowh
edge
perfect
?
Behold
,
1
say
unto
you
,
Nay
;
neither
must
ye
lay
aside
your
faith
,
for
ye
have
only
exercised
your
faith
ta
plant
the
sced
,
that
ye
might
try
the
experiment
,
to
know
j
the
seed
was
good
.
Ana
behold
,
as
the
tree
beginneth
to
gron
,
ye
will
say
,
Let
us
nourish
it
with
great
care
,
that
it
may
gd
root
,
that
it
may
grow
up
and
bring
forth
fruit
unio
us
.
Ani
now
behold
,
if
ye
nourish
it
with
much
care
,
it
will
get
rool
,
and
grow
up
,
and
bring
forth
fruit
,
But
if
ye
neglect
the
tres
and
take
no
thought
for
its
nourishment
,
behold
,
it
will
a
set
any
root
;
and
when
the
heat
of
the
sun
cometh
and
score
eth
it
,
and
because
it
hath
no
voot
,
it
withereth
away
,
and
pluck
it
up
and
cast
it
out
.
Now
this
is
not
because
the
set
was
not
good
;
neither
is
it
hecause
the
fruit
thereof
would
not
be
desirable
.
But
itis
because
your
ground
is
barren
,
ail
¥e
will
not
nourish
the
tree
;
therefore
ye
cannot
have
the
fruit
thereof
.
And
thus
if
ye
will
not
nourish
the
word
,
lookia
forward
with
au
cye
of
fiith
to
the
fruit
thereof
,
ye
can
never
pluck
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
Jife
.
But
if
ye
will
nourish
the
word
,
yea
,
nourish
the
tree
es
ii
beginneth
to
grow
,
ly
your
faith
,
with
great
diligence
,
and
with
patience
,
looking
forward
to
the
fruit
thereof
,
and
it
shall
take'root
;
and
behold
,
it
shall
be
a
tree
springing
up
unto
everlasting
life
;
'
and
be
cause
of
your
diligence
,
and
your
faith
,
and
your
patience
with
the
word
,
in
nourishing
it
,
that
it
may
take
root
in
you
,
beholll
by
and
by
,
ye
shall
pluck
the
fruit
thereof
,
which
is
most
pre
cious
,
which
is
sweet
above
all
that
is
sweet
,
and
which
®
white
above
all
that
is
white
;
yea
,
and
pure
above
all
that#
pure
;
and
ye
stiall
feast
upon
this
fruit
,
even
utitil
ye
are
ed
,
that
ye
hunger
not
,
neither
shall
ye
thirst
,
Then
my
bref

ye
shall
reap
the
rewards
of
your

your

waiting
for

Now
alter
Alma
had
spoken
these
words
,
they
sent
forth
unto
hin
desiring
to
know
whether
they
should
believe
in
one
God
,
that
they
might
obtain
this
fruit
of
which
he
had
spoken
,
or
how
they
should
plant
the
seed
,
or
the
word
,
of
which
he
had
spoken
,
which
he
said
must
be
planted
in
their
hearts
;
or
in
what
manner
they
should
begin
to
exercise
their
faith
.
Aad
Alma
saith
unto
them
,
Behold
,
ye
have
said
that
ye
could
not
worship
your
God
,
because
ye
are
cast
out
of
your
syuaogucs
.
But
behold
,
{say
unto
you
,
H
ye
suppose
that
ye
cammot
worship
God
,
ye
do
greatly
err
,
and
ye
had
ought
to
search
the
Scriptures
;
for
it
ye
suppose
that
they
have
taught
.
you
this
,
ye
do
not
understand
them
,
Do
ye
remember
to
have
read
what
Zenos
,
the
prophet
of
old
,
hath
said
conceruing
prayer
or
Worship
?
for
he
saith
,
Thou
art
merciful
O
God
,
for
thou
hast
heard
my
prayer
,
even
when
I
was
in
the
wilderness
;
yea
,
thou
wast
merciful
when
I
prayed
concerning
those
which
were
mine
cnemies
,
and
thou
didst
turn
them
tome
;
yea
,
O
God
,
and
thou
wast
merciful
unio
me
when
Gil
ery
unto
thee
in
my
field
;
when
I
did
cry
unto
thee
in
my
prayer
,
end
thou
didst
hear
me
.
And
again
,
O
God
,
whea
did
turn
to
toy
house
thou
didst
hear
me
in
my
prayer
.
And
when
1
did
turn
unto
my
closet
,
O
Lord
,
and
prayed
unto
thee
,
thou
didst
hear
me
;
yea
,
thou
art
mercifnl
unto
thy
children
,
when
they
ery
unto
thee
to
be
heard
of
thee
,
and
not
of
men
;
and
thou
wilt
hear
them
;
yea
,
O
God
,
thou
hast
been
mereiful
unto
me
,
and
beard
my
cries
in
the
midst
of
thy
congregations
;
yea
,
and
thou
hast
also
heard
me
when
1
have
been
cast
out
,
and
have
been
despised
by
mine
enemies
;
yea
;
thou
didst
hear
my
cries
,
and
wast
angry
wilh
maine
enemies
,
and
thov
didst
visit
them
in
thine
anger
,
with
speedy
destruction
;
and
thou
didst
hear
me
because
of
mine
afitictions
and
my
sinceri
;
and
it
is
becausc
of
thy
Son
that
thou
hast
been
thus
mer
eifil
unto
me
;
therefore
I
will
cry
unto
thee
in
all
mine
afllictions
;
for
in
thee
is
my
joy
;,
for
thou
hast
turncd
thy
judyments
away
from
me
,
because
of
thy
Son
,
And
now
Alma
saith
unto
them
,
De
ye
believe
those
Seriptimes
which
have
been
written
by

of

Behold
,
if
ye
do
,
ye
must
believe
what
Zenos
saith
;
for
behold
,
he
saith
,
thou
hast
turned
away
thy
judgments
,
because
of
thy

Ifye

how
can

disbelieve
on

also
spake
of
these
things
;
for
behold
,
he
saith
,
hou
art
angry
,
O
Lord
,
with
this
peaple
,
because
they
will
ina
understand
of
thy
mercies
which
thou
hast
boston
upon
them
,
becanse
of
thy
Son
.
And
now
my
brethren
,
ye
see
that
a
second
prophet
of
old
has
testified
of
the
Sono
God
;
and
because
the
people
would
not
understand
his
words
,
they
patorred
him
to
death
.
-
But
behold
,
this
is
not
all
;
thes
are
not
the
only
ones
which
have
spoken
concerning
the
Son
of
God
.
Behold
,
he
was
spoken
of
by
Moses
;
yea
,
aud
be
hold
,
a
type
was
raised
up
in
the
wilderness
,
that
wi
hosoem
w
ula
look
upon
it
might
live
,
And
many
did
look
and
five
,
But
few
understood
the
meaning
of
those
things
,
and
this
he
cause
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
.
But
there
were
many
which
were
so
hardened
that
they
would
not
look
;
therefor
they
perished
.
Now
the
reason
that
they
would
not
look
,
is
because
they
did
not
believe
that
it
would
heal
them
.
O
m
brethren
,
if
ye
could
be
healed
by
merely
casting
about
your
eyes
,
that
ye
migh
!
be
healed
,
would
ye
not
behold
quickly
,
or
would
ye
rather
harden
your
hearts
in
uabelief
,
and
be
sloth
iu
),
that
ye
would
not
cast
about
your
cycs
,
that
ye
might
per
ish
?
If
so
,
wo
shall
come
upon
you
;
bi
:
if
not
so
,
then
cat
about
your
eyes
,
and
begin
to
believe
in
the
Son
of
God
,
thal
lie
will
come
to
redeem
his
people
,
and
that
he
shall
suffer
and
.
die
to
atone
for
their
sins
;
and
that
he
shall
rise
again
from
the
dead
,
which
shall
bring
to
pass
the
resurrection
,
that
al
men
shall
stand
before
him
,
to
-
be
judged
,
at
the
last
and
judg
ment
day
,
according
to
their
works
.
And
now
my
brethren
,
desire
that
ye
should
plant
this
word
in
your
hearts
,
and
asit
beginneth
to
swell
,
even
so
nourish
it
hy
your
faith
.
And
be
hold
,
it
will
become
a
tree
,
springing
up
in
you
unto
everlast
ing
life
.
And
then
may
God
grant
anto
you
that
your
burdem
may
be
light
,
through
the
joy
of
his
Son
.
And
even
all
thy
can
ye
do
,
if
ye
will
,
Amen
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Alma
had
spoken
thes
words
unto
them
,
he
sat
down
upon
the
ground
,
and
Anulek
arose
and
began
to
teach
them
,
s
saying
:
My
brethren
,
1
think
that
it
is
impossible
that
ye
should
be
ignorant
of
the
things
which
have
been
spoken
concerning
the
coming
of
is
taught
by
us
to
be
the
Son
of
God
;
yea
,
I
know
:
at
things
were
taught
unto
you
,
bountifully
,
before
,
your
diss
tion
from
among
us
.
And
as
ye
have
desired
of
brother
,
that
he
should
make
known
urto
you
whal
[File:323]
do
,
because
of
your
afflictions
;
and
he
hath
spoken
somewhat
:
uito
you
fo
prepare
your
minds
;
yea
,
and
he
hath
exhorted
you
unto
faith
,
and
to
patience
;
yea
,
even
that
ye
would
have
so
much
faith
as
even
to/plant
the
word
in
your
hearts
,
that
may
try
the
experiment
of
its
goodness
;
and
we
have
be
ield
that
the
great
question
which
is
in
your
minds
,
is
whethtrthe
word
be
in
the
Son
of
God
,
or
whether
there
shall
be
no
Christ
,
And
ye
also
beheld
that
my
brother
hath
proven
unto
you
,
in
many
instances
,
that
the
word
is
in
Christ
,
unto
silvation
.
My
brother
hath
called
upon
the
words
of
Zenos
,
at
redemption
cometh
through
the
Son
of
God
,
and
also
upon
the
words
of
Zenock
;
and
also
he
hath
appealed
unto
Mows
,
to
prove
that
these
things
are
true
.
And
now
behold
,
I
wil
testify
unto
you
of
myself
,
that
these
things
are
true
.—
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
1
do
know
that
Christ
shall
come
among
the'children
of
inen
,
to
take
upon
him
the
transeressins
of
his
people
,
and
that
he
shall
atone
for
the
sins
of
the
world
;
for
the
Lord
God
hath
spoken
it
;
for
it
is
expedient
that
an
atonement
should
be
made
;
for
according
to
the
great
plan
of
the
Erernal
God
,
there
must
be
an
atonement
made
,
or
tse
all
mankind
must
unaveidably
perish
;
yea
,
all
are
hardmed
;
yea
,
all
arc
fallen
,
and
are
Jost
,
and
must
perish
,
except
ithe
through
the
atonement
which
it
is
expedient
should
be
made
;
for
it
is
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
great
and
last
sarifice
;
yea
,
not
a
sacrifice
of
man
,
neither
of
beast
,
neither
ofany
manner
of
fowl
;
for
it
shall
not
be
a
human
sacrifice
;
bit
it
must
be
an
Infinite
and
an
-
Eternal
sacrifice
.
Now
there
snot
any
man
that
can
sacrifice
his
own
blood
,
which
will
done
for
the
sins
of
another
.
Now
if
a
man
murdereth
,
behold
,
will
our
law
,
which
ts
just
,
take
the
life
of
bis
brother
?
fay
unto
you
Nay
.
But
the
law
requireth
the
life
of
him
who
hath
murdered
;
therefore
there
ean
nothing
,
which
is
short
of
Infinite
atonement
,
which
will
suilice
for
the
sins
of
the
World
;
therefore
it
is
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
great
ind
last
sacrifice
;
and
then
shall
there
he
,
or
it
is
expedient'
there
should
be
,
a
stop
to
the
shedding
of
blood
;
then
shall
the
law
of
Moses
be
fulfilled
;
yea
,
it
shall
all
be
fulfilled
;
eySyget
and
tittle
,
and
none
shall
have
passed
away
.
And
hethis
is
the
whole
meaning
of
the
law
;
every
whit
a
pointthat
great
and
last
sacrilice
;
and
that
great
and
last
sacwill
he
the
Son
of
God
;
yea
,
Infinite
and
Eternal
;
and
®he
shall
bring
salvation
to
all
those
who
shall
believe
on
oes
this
being
the
intent
of
this
last
sacrifice
,
to
bring

But
this
is

:
ye

unto

for

and
also
for

welfare
of
those
which
&
around
you
.
And
now
behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
say
unto
you
,
D
not
suppose
that
this
is
all
;
for
after
ye
have
done
all
the
things
,
if
ye
turn
away
the
needy
,
and
the
naked
,
and
visilw
the
sick
and
afilicted
,
and
impart
of
your
substance
,
if
ye
hy
,
to
those
which
stand
in
need
;
I
say
unto
you
,
if
ye
do
notay
of
these
things
,
bchold
,
your
prayer
is
vain
,
and
availelh
nothing
,
and
ye
are
as
hypoerites
which
do
deny
the
failh
therefore
,
if
ye
do
not
remember
to
be
charitable
,
ye
ares
dross
,
which
the
refiners
do
cast
out
,
(
it
being
of
no
worth
and
is
trodden
under
foot
of
men
.
And
now
,
my
brethren
,
1
would
that
after
ye
have
receitt
so
many
witnesses
,
seeing
that
the
Holy
Scriptures
testify
dl
these
(
nings
,
come
forth
and
bring
fruit
unto
repentancegy&
i
would
that
ye
would
come
forth
and
harden
not
your
any
longer
;
for
behold
,
now
is
the
time
,
and
the
day
ol
salvation
;
and
therefore
,
if
ye
will
repent
and
bardemm
)
your
hearts
,
immediately
shall
the
great
plan
of
redemptt
brought
about
unto
you
.
For
behold
,
this
life
is
the
time
(
a
[File:325]
men
to
prepare
to
meet
God
;
yea
,
behold
,
the
day
of
this
life
js
the
day
for
men
to
perform
their
labors
.
And
now
as
Lsaid
ato
you
before
,
as
ye
have
had
so
many
witnesses
,
therefore
[beseech
of
you
,
that
ye
do
not
proerasiinate
the
day
of
your
yepentance
until
the
end
;
for
after
this
ay
of
life
,
which
is
given
us
to
prepare
for
eternity
,
behold
,
if
we
do
not
improve
our
time
while
in
this
life
,
then
cometh
the
ght
of
darkness
,
wherein
there
can
be
no
labor
performed
.
Ye
cannot
say
,
wien
ye
are
brought
to
that
awful
crisis
,
that
1
will
repent
,
dat
Iwill
return
to
my
God
.
Nay
,
ye
cannot
say
this
;
for
that
same
spirit
which
doth
possess
your
bodies
at
the
time
that
ye
go
out
of
this
life
,
that
same
spirit
will
have
power
to
possess
your
body
in
that
eternal
world
.
For
behold
,
if
ye
have
procrastinated
the
day
of
your
repentance
,
even
until
death
,
behold
,
ye
have
become
subjected
to
the
spirit
of
the
Devil
,
and
he
doth
seal
you
his
;
therefore
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
hath
withdrawn
from
you
,
and
hath
no
place
in
you
,
and
the
Devil
hath
all
power
over
you
:
and
this
is
the
final
state
athe
wicked
.
And
this
I
know
,
because
the
Lord
hath
said
,
hedwelleth
not
in
unholy
temples
,
but
in
the
hearts
of
the
ngiteous
doth
he
dwell
;
yea
,
and
he
hath
also
said
,
that
the
tgltcous
should
sit
down
in
his
kingdom
,
to
go
no
more
out
;
bat
their
garments
should
be
made
white
,
through
the
blood
othe
Lamb
.
And
now
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
desire
that
ye
should
remember
these
things
,
and
that
ye
should
work
out
your
salyation
with
fear
before
God
,
and
that
ye
should
no
more
deny
te
coming
of
Christ
:
that
ye
contend
no
more
against
the
Holy
Ghost
,
but
that
ye
receive
it
,
and
take
upon
yon
the
mame
of
Christ
;
that
ye
humble
yourselves
even
to
the
dust
,
td
worship
God
in
whatsoever
place
ye
may
be
in
,
in
spirit
and
in
au
.
and
that
ye
live
in
thanksgiving
daily
,
for
the
Many
mercies
and
blessings
which
he
doth
bestow
upon
you
;
Yel
,
and
T
also
exhort
you
,
my
brethren
,
that
ye
be
watchful
into
prayer
continually
,
that
ye
uray
not
be
Jed
away
by
the
lmpiation
of
the
Dovil
,
that
he
may
not
overpower
you
,
that
femay
not
become
his
subjects
ot
the
last
day
:
for
behold
,
he
Rwardeth
you
no
good
thing
.
And
now
my
beloved
brethMa
exhort
you
10
have
putience
,
and
that
ye
bear
Wi
all
manner
of
afflictions
;
that
ve
do
not
revile
against
:
;
tose
Who
do
cast
you
out
because
of
your
exceeding
poverty
,
re
Ye
hecome
sinners
hike
unto
them
;
but
that
ye
have
pa
[File:326]
tience
,
and
bear
with
those
afilictions
,
with
a
firm
hope
thy
ye
shall
one
day
rest
from
all
your
elilictions
,
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Amuiek
had
made
an
end
g
these
words
,
they
withdrew
themselves
from
the
multitude
and
came
ever
into
the
land
of
Jershon
;
yea
,
and
the
rest
g
the
brethren
,
after
they
had
preached
the
word
unto
the
2
ramites
,
also
came
over
into
the
land
ef
Jershon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
more
popular
part
of
te
Zoramites
had
consulted
together
,
concerning
the
words
whi
had
been
preached
unto
them
,
they
were
angry
because
of
tly
word
,
for
it
did
destroy
their
craft
;
therefore
they
would
py
hearken
unto
the
words
.
And
they
sent
and
gathered
toga
).
er
throughout
all
the
land
,
all
the
people
,
and
consulted
wil
them
concerning
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
.
Noy
their
rulers
,
and
their
priests
,
and
their
teachers
,
did
not
ly
the
people
know
concerning
their
desires
;
therefore
thy
found
out
privily
the
minds
of
all
the
people
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
found
out
the
mink
of
all
the
people
,
those
which
were
in
favor
of
the
words
whit
had
been
spoken
by
Alma
and
his
brethren
,
were
cast
out
the
Jand
;
and
they
were
many
;
and
they
came
over
also
inh
the
land
of
Jershon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
and
his
brethren
did
ming
ter
unto
them
.
Now
the
people
of
the
Zoramites
were
aug
with
the
people
of
Ammon
which
were
ia
Jershon
,
and
te
chief
ruler
of
the
Zoramites
being
a
very
wicked
man
,
sm
over
unto
the
people
of
Ammon
desiring
them
that
they
shall
east
out
of
their
land
all
those
which
came
over
from
themin
their
land
.
And
he
breathed
out
many
threatnings
again
them
.
And
now
the
people
of
Ammon
did
not
fear
thet
words
,
therefore
they
did
not
cast
them
out
,
buf
they
didi
'
ceive
all
the
poor
of
the
Zoramites
that
came
over
unto
them
and
they
did
nourish
them
,
and
did
clothe
them
,
and
did
git
unto
them
lands
for
their
inheritance
;
and
they
did
adminite
unto
them
according
to
their
wants
.
Now
this
did
stiruplt
Zoramites
to
anger
against
the
people
of
Ammon
,
and
tht
began
to
mix
with
the
Lainanites
,
and
to
stir
them
up
also

XVIL
The
Commandments
of
Alma

Helaman

_
My
son
,
give
car
to
my
words
;
for
I
swear
unto
you
,
that
uasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
.
I
would
that
ye
should
do
as
I
have
Aone
,
in
remembering
the
captivity
of
our
fathers
;
for
they
Were
in
bondage
,
and
none
could
deliver
them
,
except
it
was
the
God
of
Abraham
,
and
the
God
of
Isaac
,
and
the
God
of
Jacob
;
and
he
surely
did
deliver
them
in
their
afflictions
,
—
now
,
O
my
son
Telaman
,
behold
,
thou
art
in
thy
youth
,
aud
therefore
I
beseech
of
thee
that
thou
wilt
hear
my
words
,
[File:328]
and
learn
of
me
;
for
I
doknow
that
whomsoever
shall
put
his
trust
in
God
,
shall
be
supported
in
their
trials
,
and
their
troub
.
les
,
and
their
afflictions
,
and
shall
be
lified
up
at
the
last
day
;
and
I
would
not
that
ye
think
that
I
know
of
myself
,
not
of
the
temporal
,
but
of
the
spiritual
;
not
of
the
carnal
mind
,
buy
of
God
,
Now
behold
I
say
unto
you
,
If]
had
not
been
bom
of
God
,
1
should
not
have
known
these
things
;
but
God
hath
,
by
the
mouth
of
his
holy
angel
,
made
these
things
known
uw
.
to
me
,
not
of
any
worthiness
of
myself
,
for
I
went
about
with
the
sons
of
Mosiah
,
sccking
to
destroy
the
church
of
God
;
but
behold
,
God
sent
his
holy
angel
to
stop
us
by
the
way
—
And
behold
,
he
spake
unto
us
,
as
it
were
the
voice
of
thun
der
,
and
the
whole
carth
did
tremble
beneath
our
feet
,
and
we
all
fell
1o
the
earth
,
for
the
fear
of
the
Lord
came
upon
us
But
behold
,
the
voice
said
unto
me
,
Arise
.
And
I
arose
and
stood
up
,
and
beheld
the
angel
.
And
he
said
unto
me
,
[f
thoy
wilt
of
thyself
be
destroyed
,
seek
no
more
to
destroy
the
church
of
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
fell
to
the
earth
;
and
it
was
for
the
space
of
three
days
and
three
nights
,
that
T
could
not
open
my
mouth
;
neither
had
I
the
use
of
my
limbs
.
And
the
angel
spake
more
things
unto
me
,
which
were
heard
by
my
brethren
,
but
[
did
not
hear
them
;
for
when
I
heard
the
words
,
If
thou
wilt
be
destroyed
of
thyself
,
seek
no
more
to
destroy
the
church
of
God
,
I
was
struck
with
such
great
fear
and
amaze
ment
,
lest
perhaps
that
I
should
be
destroyed
,
that
I
fell
to
the
earth
,
and
I
did
hear
no
more
;
but
I
was
racked
with
etemal
torment
,
for
my
soul
was
harrowed
up
to
the
greatest
degree
,
and
racked
with
all
my
sins
.
Yea
,
I
did
remember
all
m
sins
and
iniquities
,
for
which
Twas
tormented
with
the
pains
of
hell
;
yea
,
I
suw
that
I
had
rebelled
against
my
God
,
ani
that
I
had
not
kept
his
holy
commandments
;
yea
,
and
I
hal
murdered
many
of
his
children
,
or
rather
led
them
away
unio
destruction
;
yea
,
and
in
fine
,
so
great
had
been
my
iniquilies
that
the
very
thoughts
of
coming
into
the
presence
of
my
Gol
,
did
rack
my
soul
with
inexpressible
horror
.
_O
,
thought
J
,
thet
I
could
be
banished
and
become
extinct
both
soul
and
hody
,
that
I
might
not
be
brought
to
stand
in
the
presence
of
my
Goi
,
to
be
judged
of
my
deeds
.
And
now
,
for
three
days
and
for
three
nights
was
I
racked
,
even
with
the
pains
of
a
damned
soul
,
s
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
I
was
thus
racked
with
torment
while
J
was
harrowed
up
by
the
memory
of
my
many
siM§
[File:329]
behold
,
f
remembered
also
to
have
heard
ny
father
prophecy
uno
the
people
,
concerning
the
coming
of
one
Jesus
Christ
,
a
Son
of
God
,
to
atone
for
the
sins
of
the
world
.
Now
as
my
mind
caught
hold
upon
this
thought
,
I
cried
within
my
heart
,
0
Jesus
,
thou
Son
of
God
,
have
mercy
on
me
,
who
art
in
the
gall
of
bitterness
,
and
art
encircled
about
by
the
everlasting
chains
of
death
.
And
now
behold
,
when
}
thought
this
,
1
could
remember
my
pains
no
more
;
yea
,
I
was
harrowed
up
by
the
memory
of
my
sins
no
more
.
And
O
,
what
Joy
,
anc
what
marvellous
light
I
did
behold
;
yea
,
my
sou
!
was
filled
with
joy
as
exceeding
as
wasmy
pain
;
yea
,
I
say
unto
you
,
my
son
,
that
there
could
be
nothing
so
exquisite
and
so
bitter
,
as
was
my
pains
.
Yea
,
and
again
I
say
unto
you
,
iny
son
,
that
onthe
other
hand
,
there
can
be
nothing
so
exquisite
and
sweet
as
was
my
joy
;
yea
,
and
methought
I
saw
even
as
our
father
Lehi
saw
,
God
sitting
upon
his
throne
,
surrounded
with
numherless
concourses
of
angels
,
in
the
attitude
of
singing
and
.
puising
their
God
;
yea
,
and
my
soul
did
long
to
be
there
.
But
behold
,
my
limbs
did
receive
their
strength
again
,
and
I
stood
upon
my
feet
,
and
did
manifest
unto
the
pcople
that
I
tad
been
born
of
God
;
yea
,
and
from
that
time
,
even
until
now
,
Ihave
labored
without
ceasing
,
that
I
might
bring
souls
wto
repentance
;
that
I
might
bring
them
to
taste
of
the
exceeding
joy
of
which
]
did
taste
;
that
they
might
also
be
born
of
God
,
and
be
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost
.
Yea
,
and
now
behold
,
O
my
son
,
the
Lord
doth
give
me
exceeding
great
joy
in
the
fruit
of
my
labors
;
for
because
of
the
word
which
he
hath
imparted
unto
me
,
behold
,
many
hath
been
born
of
God
,
and
hath
tasted
as
I
have
tasted
,
and
hath
seen
eye
to
eye
,
as
T
have
seen
;
therefore
they
do
know
of
these
things
of
which
Thave
spoken
,
as
I
do
know
;
and
the
knowledge
which
I
have
is
of
God
.
And
I
have
been
supported
under
trials
and
troubles
of
every
kind
,
yea
,
and
in
all
manner
of
afflictions
;
yea
,
God
hath
delivered
me
from
prison
,
and
from
bonds
,
and
ftom
death
;
yea
,
and
I
do
put
my
trust
in
him
,
and
he
wilt
still
deliver
me
;
and
I
know
that
he
will
raise
me
up
at
the
hist
day
,
to
dwell
with
him
in
glory
;
yea
,
and
J
will
praise
him
forever
,
for
he
hath
brought
our
fathers
out
of
Egypt
,
and
le
hath
swallowed
up
the
Egyptians
in
the
red
sea
;
and
-
he
led
them
hy
his
power
into
the
promised
land
;
yea
,
and
he
hath
delivered
them
out
of
bondage
and
captivity
,
from
fime
to
lime
;
yea
,
and
he
hath
also
brought
our
fathers
out
of
the
d
of
Jerusalem
;
and
he
hath
also
,
by
his
everlasting
power
,
[File:330]
delivered
them
out
of
bondage
and
captivity
,
from
time
to
time
even
down
to
the
present
day
;
and
I
have
always
retained
iy
remembrance
their
captivity
;
yea
,
and
ye
also
had
ought
to
retain
in
remembrance
,
as
I
haye
done
,
their
captivity
—
But
behold
,
my
son
,
this
is
not
all
:
for
ye
had
ought
to
know
,
as
I
do
know
,
that
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
the
command
.
ments
of
God
,
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
;
and
ye
had
ought
to
know
also
,
that
inasmuch
as
ye
will
not
keep
the
command
ments
of
God
,
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
his
presence
.
Nog
this
is
according
to
his
word
.
And
now
my
son
Helaman
,
J
command
you
that
ye
take
the
records
which
have
been
entrusted
with
me
;
and
also
com
mand
you
that
ye
shall
keep
a
record
of
this
people
,
according
as
I
have
done
,
upon
the
plates
of
Nephi
,
and
keep
all
these
things
sacred
which
I
have
kept
,
even
as
I
have
kept
them
;
for
it
is
for
a
wise
purpose
that
they
are
kept
;
and
these
plates
of
brass
which
contain
these
engravings
,
which
have
the
records
of
the
Holy
Scriptures
upon
them
,
which
have
the
genealogy
of
our
forefathers
,
even
from
the
beginning
.
Aut
behold
,
it
hath
been
prophesied
by
our
fathers
,
that
they
should
be
kept
and
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
another
,
and
be
kept
and
preserved
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
until
they
should
go
forth
unto
every
nation
,
kindred
,
tongue
and
peo
ple
,
that
they
shall
know
of
the
mysteries
contained
thereon
,
And
now
behold
,
if
they
are
kept
,
they
must
retain
their
brightness
;
yea
,
and
they
will
retain
their
brightness
;
yea
,
and
also
shall
all
the
plates
which
do
contain
that
which
is
Holy
Writ
Now
ye
may
suppose
that
this
is
foolishness
in
me
;
but
behold
I
say
ynto
you
,
hat
by
small
and
simple
things
,
are
great
things
brought
to
pass
;
and
small
means
,
in
manyinstances
,
doth
eon
found
the
wise
.
And
the
Lord
God
doth
work
by
means
to
bring
about
his
great
and
eternal
purposes
;
and
by
yery
small
means
the
Lord
doth
confound
the
wise
,
and
bringeth
about
the
salvation
of
many
souls
,
And
now
,
it
hath
hitherto
been
wisdom
it
God
,
that
these
things
should
be
preserved
:
for
behold
,
they
have
enlarged
the
memory
of
this
people
,
yea
,
and
convinced
many
of
the
error
of
their
ways
,
and
brought
them
to
the
knowledz
of
their
God
,
unto
the
salvation
of
theirsouls
,
Yea
,
J
say
unto
you
,
were
it
not
for
these
things
that
these
records
do
contain
,
which
are
on
these
plates
,
Ammon
and
his
brethren
could
net
lave
convinced
so
.
many
thousand
of
the
Laznanites
,
of
the
incorrect
tradition
of
their
fathers
;
yea
,
these
records
and
their
words
,
brought
them
unto
repentance
;
that
is
,
they
[File:331]
prought
them
to
the
knowledge
of
the
Lord
their
God
,
and
to
rejoice
in
Jesus
Christ
,
thcir
Redeemer
.
And
who
knaweth
but
what
they
will
be
the
means
of
bringing
many
thousands
of
them
,
yea
,
and
elso
many
thousands
of
our
stiffnecked
brethren
,
the
Nephites
,
which
are
now
hardening
their
hearts
in
sin
and
imiquities
,
to
the
knowledge
of
their
Redeemer
?—
Now
these
mysteries
are
noi
yet
fully
made
known
unto
me
;
therefore
I
shall
forbear
.
And
it
may
suffice
,
if
L
only
say
,
ihey
are
preserved
for
awise
purpose
,
which
purpose
is
known
uto
God
:
for
he
doth
counsel
in
wisdom
over
all
his
works
,
and
his
paths
are
straight
,
and
his
course
is
one
eternal
round
,
Oremember
,
remember
,
my
son
Helaman
,
how
strict
are
the
commandments
of
God
.
And
he
saith
,
If
ye
will
keep
my
coomandments
,
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
;
but
if
ye
keep
uot
his
commandments
,
ye
shull
be
cut
off
from
his
presence
.
And
now
remember
,
my
son
,
that
God
hath
entrusted
you
wilh
these
things
,
which
are
sacred
,
which
he
hath
kept
saeed
,
and
also
which
he
will
keep
and
prescrve
for
a
wise
purpose
in
him
,
that
he
may
shew
forth
his
power
unto
future
gencrations
,
And
now
behold
,
I
tell
you
by
the
spirit
of
prophecy
,
that
if
ye
transgress
the
commandments
of
God
,
behold
,
these
things
which
are
sacred
,
shall
be
taken
away
from
you
by
the
power
of
God
,
and
ye
shall
be
delivered
up
unto
satan
,
that
he
may
sift
you
as
chail'
before
the
wind
;
but
if
ye
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
do
with
these
things
which
are
saered
,
according
to
that
which
the
Lord
doth
command
you
,
(
for
you
mnust
appeal
unio
tie
Lord
for
all
things
whatsoever
ye
must
do
with
them
,)
behold
,
no
power
of
earth
or
hell
can
take
them
from
you
,
for
Cod
is
powerful
to
the
fulfilling
of
all
his
Words
:
for
he
will
fulfil
all
his
promises
which
he
shall
make
tato
you
,
for
he
hath
fulfilled
his
promise
which
he
hath
made
unto
our
fathers
.
For
he
promised
unto
them
that
he
would
Tesetve
these
things
for
a
wise
purpose
in
him
,
that
he
might
shew
forth
his
power
unto

.
And
now
behold
,
one
purpose
hath
he
fulfilled
,
even
to
the
'estoraiion
of
many
thousands
of
the
Lamanites
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
;
and
he
hath
shewn
forth
his
power
in
them
,
and
he
will
also
still
shew
forth
his
power
in
them
,
unto

Seherations
;
therefore
they

therefore
J
Command

,
and
that

[File:332]
And
now
,
Iwill
speak
unto
you
concerning
those
twenty
.
four
plates
,
that
ye
keep
them
,
that
the
mysteries
and
the
works
of
darkness
,
and
their
secret
works
,
or
the
sceret
works
of
those
people
,
which
have
been
destroyed
,
may
be
mate
manifest
unto
this
people
;
yea
,
all
their
murders
,
and
rohbings
and
their
plunderings
,
and
all
their
wickedness
,
and
aboming
.
tions
,
may
be
made
manifest
unto
this
people
;
yea
,
and
the
ye
preserve
these
directors
.
For
behold
,
the
Lord
saw
thr
his
people
began
to
work
in
darkness
,
yea
,
work
secret
my
.
ders
and
abominations
;
therefore
the
Lord
said
,
If
they
did
not
repent
,
they
should
be
destroyed
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
.
And
the
Lord
said
,
1
will
prepare
unto
my
servan
,
Gazelem
,
a
stone
,
which
shall
shine
forth
in
darkness
uni
light
that
T
may
discover
unto
my
people
which
serve
me
that
I
may
discover
unto
them
the
works
of
their
brethren
;
yea
,
their
sceret
works
,
their
works
of
darkness
,
and
their
wickedness
and
abominations
.
And
now
my
son
,
these
dire
tors
were
prepared
,
that
the
word
of
God
might
be
fulfilled
,
which
he
spake
,
saying
:
I
will
bring
forth
out
of
darknes
unto
light
,
all
their
secret
works
and
their
abominations
;
ani
except
they
repent
,
I
will
destroy
them
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
;
and
I
will
bring
to
light
.
all
their
secrets
and
abomins
tions
,
unto
every
nation
that
shall
hereafter
possess
the
land
And
now
,
my
son
,
we
see
that
they
did
not
repent
;
therefor
they
have
been
destroyed
,
and
thus
far
the
word
of
God
bath
been
fulfilled
;
yea
,
their
secret
abommations
have
been
brought
out
of
darkness
,
and
made
known
unto
us
.
And
now
my
son
,
command
you
that
ye
retain
all
ther
oaths
,
and
their
covenants
,
and
their
agreements
in
theirsecrt
abominations
;
yea
,
and
all
their
signs
and
their
wonders
ye
shall
retain
from
this
people
,
that
they
know
them
not
,
let
peradventure
they
should
{all
into
darkness
also
,
and
be
des
troyed
.
For
behold
,
there
is
a
curse
upon
all
this
Tand
,
th
!
destruction
shall
come
upon
all
those
workers
of
darkness
,
according
to
the
power
of
God
,
when
they
are
fully
ripe
;
therefore
I
desire
that
this
people
might
not
be
destroyed
—
Therefore
,
ye
shall
keep
these
secret
plans
of
their
oaths
and
their
covenants
from
this
people
,
and
only
their
wickedness
and
their
murders
,
and
their
abominations
,
shall
ye
make
known
unto
them
;
and
ye
shall
teach
them
to
abhor
such
wicked
ness
,
and
abominations
,
and
murders
;
and
ye
shall
also
teach
them
,
that
these
people
were
destroyed
on
account
of
theit
wickedness
,
and
abominations
,
and
their
murders
,
For
behold
,
[File:333]
they
murdered
all
the
prophets
of
the
Lord
which
came
among
then
,
to
declare
unto
them
concerning
,
their
iniquities
;
and
the
blood
of
those
which
they
murdered
,
did
cry
unto
the
Jord
their
God
,
tor
vengeance
upon
those
which
were
their
murderers
;
and
thus
the
judgments
of
God
did
come
upon
these
workers
of
darkness
and
sceret
combinations
;
yea
,
and
qursed
be
the
land
forever
and
cve
r
unto
those
workers
of
darkness
and
sceyet
combinations
,
even
unto
destruction
,
except
they
repent
before
they
are
fully
ripe
.
And
now
my
soa
,
remember
the
words
which
I
have
spokon
unto
you
:
trust
not
those
secret
plans
unto
this
people
,
but
teach
them
an
everlasting
hatred
againsi
sin
and
iniquity
5
preach
unto
them
repentance
,
end
faith
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
;
teach
them
to
humble
themselves
,
and
to
be
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
;
teach
them
to
withstand
every
temptation
of
the
Devil
,
with
their
faith
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
;
teach
them
to
never
be
weary
of
good
works
,
but
to
be
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
:
for
such
shall
find
rest
to
their
souls
.
O
remember
my
son
,
and
learn
wisdom
in
thy
youth
;
yea
,
learn
inthy
youth
to
keep
the
commandments
of

and

atlections
of
thy
heart
be
placed
upon

Lord
forever
;

Lord
in
all
thy
doinys
,
and
he
will

when
thou
liest
down
at
night
,
lie
down
uato
the
Lord
,
iathe

watch
over
you
in
your
sleep
;
and
when
thou

,
let

be
full
of
thanks
unto

;
and
if

do
these
things
,
ye

at
the
last
day
.
4nd
now
my
son
,
have
somewhat
to
say
concerning
the
thing
which
our
fathers
call
a
ball
,
or
director
;
or
our
fathers
called
itliahona
,
which
is
,
being
interpreted
,
a
compass
;
and
the
lord
prepared
it
.
And
behold
,
there
cannot
-
any
man
work
ler
the
manner
of
so
curious
a
workmanship
.
And
behold
,
it
was
prepared
to
shew
unto
our
fathers
the
course
which
they
should
travel
in
the
wilderness
;
and
it
did
work
for
them
according
to
their
faith
in
God
;
therefore
if
they
had
faith
to
believe
that
God
could
cause
that
those
spindles
should
Point
the
way
they
should
go
,
behold
,
it
was
done
;
therefore
—
y
had
this
miracle
,
and
also
many
other
miracles
wrought
ly

power
of
God
,
day
by
day
;
nevertheless
,
because
those
mncles
were
worked
by
small
means
,
nevertheless
it
did
thew
unto
thom
marvellous
works
.
They
were

,
and
they
did
not
progress
in
their
joup

which

point
unto
them
a
straight
course
forgot
to
exereise
their
faith
and

,
and
then
those
ma

ney
;
therefore
they
tarried
in
the
wilderness
,
or
did
not
trayg
a
divect
course
,
and
were
afflicted
with
hunger
and
thirst
,

of
their
transgressions

a
Aud
now
my
son
,
I
would
that
ye
should
understand
thy
these
things
are
not
without'a
shadow
;
for
as
our
fathe
were
sloth{ul
to
give
hecd
to
this
compass
,
(
now
these
thig
were
temporal
,)
they
did
not
prosper
;
evem
so
itis
with
thing
which
are
spintual
.
For
behold
,
it
is
as
easy
to
give
hoy
tothe
word
of
Chyist
,
which
will
point
to
you
a
straight
cour
to
eternal
bliss
,
as
it
was
for
our
fathers
to
give
heed
to
th
the
promised
land
.
And
now
1
say
,
Is
there
not
a
type
in
tis}
thing
?
Lor
just
as
suredly
as
this
director
did
bring

by
following
its
course
,
to
the
promised
land
,

of
Christ
,
if
we
follow
its
course
,
carry
us
beyond
fig
vale
of
sorrow
,
into
a
far
better
land
of
promise
.
r
O
my
son
,
do
not
let
us
be
slothful
,
because
.
of
the
easi
of
the
way
;
for
so
was
it
with
our
fathers
;
for
so
was
it
me
pared
for
them
,
that
if
they
would
look
,
they
might
live
;
erg

8o
it
is
with

The
way
is
prepared
,
and
if
we
will
look

may
live
forever

And

sacred
things

my
words
:
for
I
say
unto
you
,
event
said
unto
Helaman
,
That
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
commandments
of
God
,
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
;
and
asmuch
as
ye
will
not
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
shall
be
cast
off
from
his
presence
.
And
now
my
son
,
J
tnt
that
I
shall
have
great
joy
in
you
,
because
of
your
steadinet
and
your
faithfulness
unto
God
;
for
as
you
have
commencel
in
your
youth
,
to
look
to
the
Lord
your
God
,
even
so
1
how
)
that
you
will
continue
in
keeping
his
commandments
:
blessed
is
he
that
endureth
to
the
end
.
1
say
unto
you
[File:335]
ot
,
that
I
have
had
great
joy
in
thee
already
,
because
of
thy
gildulness
,
and
(
hy
diligence
,
and
thy
patience
,
and
thy
long
fering
among
the
people
of
the
Zoramites
.
For
1
knew
bal
thou
wast
in
bonds
;
yea
,
and
I
also
knew
that
thou
wast
amed
for
the
word's
sake
;
and
thou
cidst
bear
all
these
tings
with
patience
,
because
the
Lord
was
with
thee
:
and
mwthou
knowest
that
the
Lord
did
deliver
thee
.
And
now
my
son
Shiblon
,
I
would
that
ye
should
rememi
that
as
much
as
ye
shall
put
your
trust
in
God
,
even
so
puch
ye
shall
be
delivered
out
of
your
trials
,
and
your
troubjg
and
your
afflictions
;
and
ye
shall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
iy
.
Now
my
son
,
1
would
not
that
ye
should
think
that
4
jnow
those
things
of
myself
,
but
it
is
the
spirit
of
God
which
sin
me
,
which
maketh
these
things
known
unto
me
:
for
if
I
wdnot
been
born
of
God
,
1
should
not
have
known
these
tings
,
But
behold
,
the
Lord
in
his
great
merey
sent
his
anato
declare
unto
me
,
that
I
must
stop
the
work
of
destrucim
among
his
people
;
yea
,
and
J
have
seen
an
angel
face
to
fe
;
amd
be
spake
with
me
,
and
his
voice
was
as
thunder
,
adit
shook
the
whole
earth
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
was
three
days
and
three
nights
ithe
most
bitter
pain
and
anguish
of
soul
;
and
never
,
until
I
dil
cry
out
unto
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
for
mercy
,
did
1
reeivearemission
of
my
sins
.
But
behold
,
I
did
ery
unto
him
,
ad{did
find
peace
to
my
soul
.
And
now
my
sop
,
I
have
.
aldyou
this
,
that
ye
may
learn
wisdom
,
that
ye
may
learn
of
me
that
there
is
no

whereby

can
be

only
in
and
through
Christ

_
Behold

of
the
world
.
Behold
,
he
is

And
now
,
as
ye
have
begun
to
teach
the
word
,
even
so
¥
would
that
ye
should
continue
to

and
©
lwould
that
ye
would
be
diligent
and
temperate
in
all
things
.
See
that
ye
are
not
lifted
up
unto
pride
;
yea
,
see
that
ye
do
tot
boast
in
your
own
wisdom
,
nor
of
your
much
strength
;
ite
holdness
,
but
not
overbearance
;
and
also
sce
that
ye
bride
all
your
passions
,
that
ye
may
be
filled
with
love
;
see
that
Terefrain
from
idleness
;
do
not
pray
as
the
Zoramites
do

for
Je
have
seen
that
they
pray
to
he
heard
of
men
,
and
to
be
thised
for
their
wisdom
.
Do
not
say
,
O
God
,
I
thank
thee
ative

better
than
our
brethren
;
but
rather

,
O

;
Orive
my
unworthiness

and

in

;

CHAPTER
XIX
.
The
Commandments
of
Alma
,
to
his
son
Corianion
,
And
now
my
son
,
I
have
somewhat
more
to
Say
unto
thy
than
what
I
suid
unto
thy
brother
:
for
behold
,
have
ye
ne
observed
the
steadiness
of
thy
brother
,
his
faithfulness
,
a}
his
diligence
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
God
?
Behae
hus
he
not
set
a
good
example
for
thee
?
For
thon
didst
by
give
so
much
heed
unto
my
words
as
did
thy
brother
,
am
the
people
of
the
Zoramites
.
Now
this
is
what
Thave
againg
thee
:
Thou
didst
go
on
unto
boasting
in
thy
strength
,
aj
thy
wisdom
.
And
this
is
not
all
,
my
son
.
Thou
didsth
that
which
was
grievous
unto
me
;
for
thou
didst
forsake
th
ministry
,
and
did
go
over
into
the
land
of
Siron
,
among
te
borders
of
the
Lamanites
,
after
the
harlot
Isabel
3
yea
,
she
dil
steal
away
the
hearts
of
many
;
but
this
was
no
excuse
fr
thee
,
my
son
.
Thou
shouldst
have
tended
to
the
uninisty
,
wherewith
thou
wast
entrusted
.
Know
ye
not
,
my
son
,
thi
these
things
are
an
abomination
in
the
sight
of
the
Lord
:
yeu
most
abominable
above
ail
sins
,
save
it
he
the
shedding
of
innocent
blood
,
or
denying
the
Holy
Ghost
?
for
behold
,
ifr
deny
the
Holy
Ghost
when
it
once
hath
had
place
in
you
,
and
ye
know
that
ye
deny
it
;
behold
,
this
isa
sin
which
is
unpar
donable
;
yea
,
and
whosoever
murdcreth
against
the
light
and
Imowledge
of
God
,
it
is
not
easy
for
him
to
obtain
forgiveness
;
yea
,
Tsay
unto
you
,
my
son
,
that
it
is
not
easy
for
hin
tool
tain
a
forgiveness
.
And
now
my
son
,
I
would
to
God
thet
it
had
not
been
guilty
of
so
great
a
crime
.
{
would
not
dye
upon
your
crimes
,
1o
harrow
up
your
soul
,
if
it
were
not
fir
your
good
.
But
beheld
,
ye
cannot
hide
your
crimes
from
God
;
and
except
ye
repent
,
they
will
stand
as
a
testimony
against
you

Now

should
repent
,
and
forsake

sins
,
and
go

more
aller
the
lusts
of
your
eyes
,
but
cross
yourself
in
all
these
things
;
.
for
exeept
ye
do
this
,
ye
can
in
no
wise
inherit
the
Kingdon
of
God
.
O
remember
,
and
take

upon
you
,
and

And
I

upon
you
eounsel
your
elder
brothers
in
your
undertakings
;
for
bejold
,
thou
art
in
thy
youth
,
and
ye
stand
in
need
to
be
nourshed
by
your
brothers
.
And
give
heed
to
their
counsel
;
afer
not

to
be
led
away
by
any
vain
or
foolish
fing
;
suffer
not
that
the
Devil
lead
away
your
heart
again
,
dier
those
wicked
harlots
,
Behold
,
O
my
:
son
,
how
great
inqity
ye
brought
upon
the
Zoramites
:
for
when
they
saw
jor
conduct
,
dicy
would
not
believe
in
my
words
.
And
now
feepinit
of
the
Lord
doth
say
unto
me
,
Command
thy
chiljun
to
do
good
,
lest
they
lead
away
the
hearts
of
many
peoeto
destruction
:
therefore
1
command
you
,
my
son
,
in
the
iar
of
God
,
that
ye
refrain
from
your
iniquities
;
that
ye
turn
othe
Lord
with
all
your
mind
,
might
and
strength
;
that
ye
lead
way
the
hearts
of
no
more
,
to
do
wickedly
;
but
rather
rewn
unto
them
,
and
acknowledge
your
faults
,
and
retain
that
wong
which
ye
have
done
;
seck
not
after
riches
,
nor
the
ain
things
of
this
world
;
for
behold
,
you
cannot
carry
them
eh
you
.
Aad
now
,
my
son
,
I
would
say
somewhat
unto
you
concern
.
igthe
coming
of
Christ
.
Behold
,
1
say
unto
you
,
that
it
is
lm
that
surely
shall
come
,
to
take
away
the
sins
of
the
wold
;
yea
,
he
cometh
to
declare
glad
tidings
of
salvation
glo
brs
people
.
And
now
my
son
,
this
was
the
ministry
unto
whieh
ye
were
called
,
to
declare
these
glad
tidimgs
unto
this
imple
,
to
prepare
their
minds
;
or
rather
that
salvation
might
cone
unto
them
,
that
they
may
prepare
the
minds
of
their
diliren
to
hear
the
word
at
the
time
of
his
coming
.
And
tow
J
will
ease
your
mind
somewhat
on
this
subject
.
Behold
,
ju
marvel
why
these
things
should
be
known
so
long
beforetnd
.
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
fs
not
a
soul
at
this
time
as
fecious
unto
God
,
as
a
soul
will
be
at
the
time
of
his
coming
?
Kitnot
as
necessary
that
the
plan
of
redemption
should
be
mde
known
unto
this
people
,
as
well
as
unto
their
children
?
kitnot
as
easy
at
this
time
,
for
the
Lord
to
send
his
angel
to
declare
these
glad
tidings
unto
us
,
as
unto
our
children
;
or
efter
the
time
of
his
coming
?
Now
my
son
,
here
is
somethat
more
I
would
say
unio
thee
;
for
I
perceive
that
thy
and
is
worried
concerning
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
.—
Behold
,
1
say
unto
you
,
that
there
is
no
resurrection
;
or
I
fould
say
,
in
other
:
words
,
that
this
mortal
does
not
put
on
ality
;
this
corruption
does
not
put
en
incorruption
,
uner
the
coming
of
Christ
.
Behold
,
he
bringeth
to
pass
[File:338]
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
.
But
behold
,
my
son
,
the
ms
urrection
is
not
yet
.
Now
unfold
unto
you
a
mystery
;
py
ertheless
,
there
are
many
mysteries
,
which
are
kept
,
th
one
knoweth
them
,
save
God
himself
.
But
]
shew
unte
oue
thing
,
which
I
have
inquired
diligently
of
God
,
that
I
qi
know
;
that
is
,
concerning
the
resurrection
.
Bchold
,
theres
a
time
appointed
that
all
shall
come
forth
from
.
the
dead
.
Now
when
this
time
cometh
,
no
one
knows
;
but
God
kings
eth
the
time
which
is
appointed
.
Now
whether
there
ski
be
one
time
,
or
a
second
time
,
or
a
third
time
,
that
men
shi
come
forth
irom
the
dead
,
it
mattereth
not
;
for
God
lnony
all
these
things
;
and
it
sufficeth
me
to
know
that
this
ish
case
;
that
there
is
a
time
appointed
that
all
shall
rise
ty
the
dead
.
'
Now
there
must
needs
be
a
space
betwixt
§
time
of
death
,
and
the
time
of
the
resurrection
.
And
nop
!
would
inquire
what
becometh
of
the
souls
of
men
,
fron
dy
time
of
death
,
to
the
time
appointed
for
the
resurrectionh
Now
whether
there
is
more
than
one
time
appointed
for
ae
to
rise
,
it
mattereth
not
;
for
all
do
not
die
at
once
;
and
thi
mattercih
not
;
all
is
as
one
day
,
with
God
;
and
time
oni
:
measured
unto
men
;
therefore
there
is
a
time
appointed
my
men
,
that
they
shall
rise
from
the
dead
;
and
there
is
sper
between
the
time
of
death
and
the
resurrection
,
And
mm
concerning
this
space
of
time
.
What
becometh
of
the
suk
of
men
,
is
the
thing
which
I
have
inquired
diligently
of
&
Lord
to
know
;
and
this
is
the
thing
of
which
Ido
knor~
And
when
the
time
cometh
when
all
shall
rise
,
then
shall
the
know
that
God
knoweth
all
the
times
which
are
appoinie
unto
man
.
Now
concerning
the
state
of
the
soul
betwer
death
and
the
resurrection
.
Behold
,
it
hath
been
made
knon
unto
me
,
by
an
angel
,
that
the
spirits
of
all
men
,
as
soon
&
they
are
departed
from
this
mortal
body
;
yea
,
the
spirils
all
men
,
whether
they
be
good
or
evil
,
are
taken
home
to
tht
God
who
gave
them
life
.
And
then
shall
it
come
to
pass
th
the
spirits
of
those
which
are
righteous
,
are
received
into
!
state
of
happiness
,
which
is
called
paradise
;
a
state
of
ret
astate
of
peace
,
where
they
shall
rest
from
all
their
troubles
and
from
all
care
,
and
sorrow
,
&c
.
And
then
shall
it
cam
to
pass
,
that
the
spirits
of
the
wicked
,
yea
,
which
are
evil
;
behold
,
they
have
no
part
nor
portion
of
the
spirit
of
lle
Liord
;
for
behold
,
they
chose
evil
works
,
rather
than
gout
;
therefore
the
spirit
of
the
Devil
did
enter
into
them
,
and
take
possession
of
their
house
;
and
these
Shall
be
cast
out
inl
[File:339]
miter
darkness
;
there
shall
be
weeping
,
and
wailing
,
and
mashing
of
teeth
;
and
this
because
of
their
own
iniquity
;
being
led
captive
by
the
will
of
the
Devil
.
Jsow
this
is
the
date
of
tle
souls
of
the
wicked
;
yea
,
in
darkness
,
and
a
date
of
awful
,
fearful
looking
for
of
the
fiery
indignation
of
the
wrath
of
God
upon
them
;
thus
they
remain
in
this
st
2s
wellas
the
righteous
in
paradise
,
until
the
time
of
their
resurmetion
.
Now
there
are
some
that
have
undersicod
that
this
date
of
happiness
,
and
this
state
of
misery
of
ihe
soul
,
hefore
the
resurrection
,
was
a
first
resurrection
.
Yea
,
admit
it
may
te
termed
a
resurrection
;
the
raising
of
the
spirit
or
the
soul
,
and
their
consignation
to
happiness
or
misery
,
according
to
ihe
words
which
,
have
been
spoken
.
And
behold
,
again
it
jath
been
spoken
,
that
there
is
a
first
resurrection
;
a
resurs
rection
of
all
those
which
have
been
,
or
witch
are
,
or
which
shall
be
,
down
to
the
resurrection
of
Christ
from
the
dead
.—
Now
we
do
not
suppose
that
this
first
resurrection
which
is
spoken
of
in
this
manner
,
cani
be
the
resurrection
of
the
souls
,
amd
their
consignation
to
happiness
or
misery
.
Ye
cannot
suppose
that
this
is
what
it
meaneth
.
Bebold
,
fsay
unto
you
Nay
;
but
it
meaneth
the
re
-
uniting
of
the
soul
with
the
body
ofthose
from
the
days
of
Adam
,
down
to
the
resurrection
of
Christ
.
Now
whether
the
souls
and
the
bodies
of
thoxe
of
which
have
been
spoken
,
shall
all
be
re
-
united
at
once
,
the'
Wicked
as
well
as
the
righteous
,
Ido
not
say
;
let
it
suffice
,
tat
1
say
that
they
all
come
forth
;
orin
other
words
,
their
tesntrection
cometh
to
pass
before
the
resurrection
of
those
which
die
after
the
resurrection
of
Christ
.
Now
my
son
,
I
do
ttsay
that
their
resurrection
cometh
at
the
resurrection
of
Christ
;
but
behold
,
1
give
it
as
my
opinion
,
that
the
souls
and
the
bodies
are
re
-
united
,
of
the
righteous
,
at
the
resurrection
of
Christ
,
and
his
ascension
into
Heaven
.
But
whether
itbeat
his
resurrection
,
or
after
,
Ido
not
say
;
but
this
much
sty
:
That
there
isa
space
between
death
and
the
resurrectin
of
the
body
,
and
a
state
of
the
soul
in
happiness
or
in
isery
,
until
the
time
which
is
appointed
of
God
that
the
dead
shall
come
forth
,
and
be
re
-
united
,
both
soul
and
body
,
aid
be
brought
to
stand
before
God
,
and
be
judged
according
,
te
their
works
;
yea
,
this
bringeth
about
the
restoration
of
those
things
of
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
mouths
of
the
hets
.
The
soul
shall
be
restored
to
the
body
,
and
the
to
the
soul
;
yea
,
and
every
limb
and
joint
shall
be
red
to
its
body
,
yea
,
even
a
hairof
the
head
shall
not
be
[File:340]
lost
,
but
all
things
shall
be
restored
to
its
proper
and
perfect
frame
,
And
now
my
son
,
this
is
tie
restoration
of
which
hes
been
spoken
by
the
mouths
of
the
prophets
:
And
then
shalj
the
righteous
shine
forth
in
the
Kingdom
of
God
.
But
behold
an
awful
death
cometh
upon
the
wicked
;
for
they
die
as
t
things
pertaining
to
things
of
righteousness
;
for
they
are
up
clean
,
and
no
unclean
thing
can
inherit
the
Kingdom
of
God
:
but
they
are
cast
out
,
and
consigned
to
partake
of
the
fruits
of
their
labors
or
their
works
,
which
have
been
evil
;
and
the
drink
the
dregs
of
a
bitter
cup
.
And
now
mny
von
,
have
somewhat
to
say
concerning
the
restoration
of
which
has
been
spoken
;
for
bebold
,
some
bay
arrested
the
Scriptures
,
and
have
gone
far
astray
,
becauseof
this
thing
.
And
perceive
that
thy
mind
hath
been
wormed
also
,
concerning
this
thing
.
But
behold
,
¥
will
explain
it
un
thee
.
Isay
unto
thee
,
my
son
,
that
the
plan
of
restoration'
:
requisite
with
the
justice
of
God
;
for
it
is
requisite
thatall
things
should
be
restored
to
their
proper
order
.
Behold
,
its
requisite
and
just
,
according
to
ihe
power
and
resurrection
d
Christ
,
that
{he
soul
of
man
should
he
restored
to
its
body
,
ant
that
every
part
of
the
body
should
be
restored
to
itxellAnd
it
is
requisite
with
the
justice
of
God
,
that
men
shoud
be
judged
according
to
their
works
;
and
if
their
warks
wer
good
in
this
life
,
and
the
desires
of
their
hearts
were
gool
,
that
they
should
also
,
at
the
last
day
,
be
restored
unto
tha
which
is
good
;
and
it
their
works
are
evil
,
they
shall
be
m
stored
unto
him
for
evil
;
therefore
,
all
things
shall
be
restored
to
their
proper
order
;
every
thing
to
its
natural
frame
;
mor
tality
raised
to
immortality
;
corruption
to
incorruption
;
ri
sed
to
endless
happiness
,
to
inherit
the
Kingdom
of
God
,
orlo
endless
misery
,
to
inherit
the
kingdom
of
the
Devil
;
the
ot
on
one
hand
,
the
other
on
the
other
;
the
one
raised
to
hap
ness
,
according
to
his
desires
of
happiness
;
or
good
,
accorditg
to
his
desires
of
good
;
and
the
other
to
evil
,
according
to
his
desires
of
evil
;
for
as
he
has
desired
to
do
evil
all
the
day
long
,
even
so
shall
he
have
his
reward
of
evil
,
when
the
nigh
cometh
,
And
so
itis
on
the
other
hand
.
If
he
hath
repent
of
his
sins
,
and
desired
righteousness
until
the
end
of
his
deys
,
even
so
le
shall
be
.
rewarded
unto
righteousness
These
are
they
that
are
redeemed
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
these
at
they
the
!
are
taken
out
,
that
sre
delivered
from
that
endles
night
of
darkness
;
and
thus
they
stand
or
fall
;
for
beliold
they
are
their
own
judges
,
whether
to
do
good
or
do
evil=
[File:341]
Now
the
decrees
of
God
are
unalterable
;
therefore
the
way
is
prepared
,
that
whosoever
will
,
may
wail
therein
and
be
saved
.
jad
now
behold
,
my
son
,
do
uot
risk
one
more
offence
against
your
God
upon
those
points
of
doctrine
,
which
ye
hath
hithaio
risked
to
commit
sin
.
Do
not
suppose
,
because
it
hath
been
spoken
concerning
restoration
,
that
ye
shall
be
restored
fot
sin
to
happiness
.
Behold
I
say
unio
you
,
Wickedness
neyer
was
happiness
.
And
now
,
my
son
,
all
men
that
are
in
avlate
of
nature
,
or
would
say
,
in
a
carnal
state
,
are
im
the
gal
of
bitterness
,
and
in
the
bonds
of
iniquity
;
they
are
without
God
in
the
world
,
and
they
have
gone
contrary
to
the
natureol
God
;
therefore
they
are
in
a
state
contrary
to
the
nature
ofhappiness
.
And
now
bedold
,
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
restoration
,
to
take
a
thing
of
a
natural
state
,
and
place
it
in
aunnaiural
state
,
or
to
place
it
in
a
state
opposite
to
its
nate
?
O
,
my
son
,
this
is
not
the
case
;
but
the
meaning
of
the
word
restoration
,
is
to
bring
back
again
evil
for
evil
,
or
tamal
for
carnal
,
or
devilish
for
devilish
;
yood
for
that
which
isgood
;
righteous
for
that
which
is
righteous
;
just
for
that
Which
is
just
;
merciful
for
that
which
is
merciful
;
therefore
,
hy
son
,
see
that
ye
are
merciful
unto
your
brethren
;
deal
jusily
,
judge
righteously
,
and
do
good
continually
;
and
if
ye
doall
these
things
,
then
shall
ye
receive
your
reward
;
yea
,
ye
shall
have
merey
restored
uato
you
again
;
ye
shall
have
justverestored
unto
you
again
;
ye
shall
have
a
righteous
jadgment
restored
unto
yon
again
;
and
ye
shall
have
good
rewarded
uno
you
again
:
for
that
which
ye
doth
send
out
,
shell
retum
unto
you
again
,
and
be
restored
;
therefore
the
word
rextorafon
,
more
fully
condemneth
-
the
sinuer
,
and

And
now

my

I
perceive
there
is
someswhat
more
which
doth
worry
your
mind
,
which
ye
cannot
understaad
,
which
is
tonceruing
the
justice
of
God
,
in
the
punishment
of
the
sinner
:
for
ye
do
try
to
suppose
that
it
is
injustice
that
whe
sinner

be
consizned
to
a
state
of
misery

Now
behold

my

I
will

to
the
word
of

,
having
no

for

ye
,
and
also
the
word
of
God
would
have

and
the

plan
of
salyation
would
have

But
behold
,
i
was
appointed
unto
man
to
die
;
therefore
as
they
were
ii
off
from
the
tree
of
Jife
,
therefore
they
should
be
cut
off
ftun
the
face
of
the
carth
;
and
man
became
lost
forever
;
ye
,
they
became
fallen
man
,
And
now
we'see
by
this
,
that
our
iy
parents
were
cut
off
,
both
temporally
and
spiritually
,
fromih
;
presence
of
the
Lord
;
and
thus
we
see
they
became
subjecs
to
follow
after
their
own
will
.
Now
behold
,
it
was
not
exye
dient
that
man
should
he
reclaimed
from
this
temporal
deal
,
for
that
would
destroy
the
great

as

thatis
,

of
the

;
therefore
it
m
expedient
that
mankind
should
be
reclaimed
from

al
death
;
therefore
as
they
had
become
carnal
,
sensual

devilish
,
by
nature
,
this
probationary
state
became
a
state
fe
them
to
prepare
:
it
became
a
preparatory
state
.
And
nor
remember
,
my
son
,
if
it
were
not
for
the
plan
of
redemptin
(
laying
it
aside
,)
as
soon
as
they
were
dead
,
their
souls
ner
miserable
,
being
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
,
An
now
there
was
no
means
to
reclaim
men
from
this
fallen
sit
!
which
man
had
brought
upon
himself
;
because
of
his
owndit
hedience
;
therefore
,
according
to
jystice
,
the
plan
of
redemp
tion
could
not
be
brought
about
,
only
,
on
conditions
:
of
rept
tance
of
men
inthis
probationary
state
;
yea
,
this
prepara

;

were
:
for
these
conditions
,

not

except
it
should
destroy
the
work
ofji
tice
.
Now
the
work
of
justice
could
not
be
destroyed
:
il
God
would
cease
to
be
God
.
And
thus
we
see
that
all
me
kind
were
fallen
,
and
they
were
in
the
grasp
of
justice
;
1
the
justice
of
God
,
which
consigned
them
forever
to
bet
off
from
his
presence
,
And
now
the
plan
of
mercy
cowldi
be
brought
about
,
except
an
atonement
should
be
malt
;
therefore
God
himself
atoneth
for
the
sins
of
the
world
,
®
bring
about
the
plan
of
mercy
,
to
appease
the
demands
of
[File:343]
fice
,
that
God
might
he
a
perfect
,
just
God
,
and
a
merciful
God
,
Also
,
now
repentance
could
not
come
unto
men
,
except
there
were
a
punishment
,
which
also
was
as
eternal
as
the
life
of
the
soul
should
be
,
affixed
opposite
to
the
plan
of
happiuess
,
which
was
as
eternal
also
as
the
life
of
the
soul
.—
Now
,
how
could
a
man
repent
,
except
he
should
sin
?
How
could
he
sin
,
if
there
was
no
law
?
How
could
there
be
a
law
,
save
there
was
a
punishment
?
Now
there
was
a
punishmeut
affixed
,
and
a
just
law
given
,
which
brought
remorse
of
conscience
unto
man
.
Now
if
there
was
no
law
given
,
if
a
man
murdered
he
should
die
,
would
he
be
afraid
he
should
die
if
he
should
murder
?
And
also
,
if
there
was
no
law
given
against
sin
,
men
would
not
be
afraid
to
sin
.
And
if
there
was
no
Jaw
given
if
men
sinned
,
what
could
justice
do
,
or
mercy
either
,
for
they
would
have
no
claim
upon
the
creature
?
But
there
isa
law
given
,
and
a
punishment
affixed
,
and
repeniance
granted
;
which
repentance
,
mercy
claimeth
;
othenwise
,
justice
claimeth
the
creature
,
and
executeth
the
law
,
and
the
law
inflicteth
the
punishment
;
if
not
so
,
the
works
of
justice
would
be
destroyed
,
and
God
would
cease
to
be
God
.
But
God
ceaseth
not
to
be
God
,
and
mercy
claimeih
the
penitent
,
and
mercy
cometh
because
of
the
atonement
;
and
the
etonement
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
;
and
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
bringcth
back
men
into
the
presence
ofGod
;
and
thus
they
are
restored
into
his
presence
,
to
be
judged
according
to
their
works
;
according
to
the
law
and
justice
;
for
behold
,
justice
exerciseth
all
his
demands
,
and
also
merey
claimeth
all
which
is
ber
own
;
and
thus
,
none
but
the
truly
penitent
are
saved
.
Whal
,
do
ye
suppose
that
mercy
can
rob
justice
?
Isay
unto
you
,
Nay
;
not
one
whit
,
Ifso
,
God
would
cease
to
be

And
thus
God
bringeth
about
his
great
and
eternal
purposes
,
which
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
.
And
thus
cometh
about
the
salvation
and
the

,
and
also
their

and

;
therefore

CHAPTER
XX
.
ANp
now
it
came
to
pass
,
that
the
sons
of
Alma
did
goforh
among
the
people
,
to
declare
the
word
unto
them
,
And
ab
ma
also
,
himscif
,
could
not
rest
,
and
he
also
went
forthNow
we
shall
say
no
mare
concerning
their
preaching
,
except
that
they
preached
the
word
,
and
the
truth
,
according
the
spirit
of
prophecy
and
revelation
;
and
they
preached
alle
the
holy
order
of
God
,
by
which
they
were
called
.
And
now
I
return
to
an
account
of
the
wars
between
the
Nephites
and
the
Lamanites
,
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
th
reign
of
the
Judges
.
For
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
te
Zoramites
became
Lamanites
;
therefore
,
in
.
the
comment
ment
of
the
eighteenth
year
,
the
people
of
the
Nephites
sar
that
the
Lamanites
were
coming
upon
them
;
therefore
ther
made
preparations
for
war
;
yea
,
they
gathered
together
ther
armies
in
the
land
of
Jershon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
thil
the
Lamanites
came
with
their
thousands
;
and
they
came
tothe
land
of
Antionam
,
which
was
the
land
of
the
Zonttt
ites
;
and
aman
by
the
name
of
Zerahemnah
was
their
leat
And
now
as
the
Amalekites
were
of
a
morewicked
and
9
init
derous
disposition
than
the
Lamanites
were
,
in
and_
of
thet
selves
,
therefore
Zerahemnah
appointed
Chief
Captains
ort
the
Lamanites
,
and
they
were
all
the
Amalekites
and
the
@
ramites
.
Now
this
he
done
,
that
he
might
preserve
their
lt
tred
towards
the
Nephites
;
that
he
might
bring
them
i
?
subjection
,
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
designs
;
for
hehelt
is
designs
were
to
stir
up
the
Lamanites
to
anger
agall®
[File:345]
the
Nephites
;
this
he
done
that
he
might
usurp
great
power
qver
them
;
and
also
that
he
might
gain
power
over
the
Nephites
,
by
bringing
them
into
bondage
,
&c
.
And
now
the
desgn
of
the
Nephites
were
to
support
their
lands
,
and
their
houses
,
aud
their
wives
,
and
their
children
,
that
they
might
preserve
them
from
the
hands
of
their
enernies
,
and
also
,
that
tiey
ight
preserve
their
rights
and
their
privileges
;
yea
,
and
dso
their
liberty
,
that
they
might
worship
God
according
to
their
desires
;
for
they
knew
that
if
they
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
whosoever
should
worship
God
,
inspirit
and
in
truth
,
the
true
and
the
living
God
,
the
Lanmanites
would
destroy
;
yea
,
and
they
also
knew
the
extreme
hatred
of
the
Lamanites
towards
their
brethren
,
which
were
the
people
of
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
;
which
were
called
the
people
d
Ammon
;
and
they
would
not
take
up
arms
;
yea
,
they
had
atered
into
a
covenant
,
and
they
would
not
break
it
;
therefore
,
if
they
should
fall
into
the
bands
of
the
Lamanites
,
they
mould
be
destroyed
.
And
the
Nephites
would
not
suffer
that
they
should
be
destroyed
;
therefore
they
gave
them
lands
for
their
inheritance
.
And
the
people
of
Ammon
did
give
unto
the
Nephites
a
large
portion
of
their
substance
,
to
support
der
armies
;
and
thus
the
Nephites
were
compelled
,
alone
,
withstand
against
the
Lamanites
,
which
were
a
compound
ofLaman
and
Lemuel
,
and
the
sons
of
Ishmacl
,
and
all
those
which
had
dissented
from
{he
Nephites
,
which
were
Amalekites
,
and
Zoramites
,
and
the
descendants
of
,
the
priests
of
Noah
.
Now
those
descendants
were
as
numerous
,
nearly
,
swere
the
Nephites
;
and
thus
the
Nephites
were
obliged
to
tontend
with
their
tirethren
,
even
unto
bloodshed
.
_
And
it
came
to
pass
,
as
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
bad
githered
together
in
the
land
of
Antionum
,
behold
,
the
armies
ifthe
Nephites
were
prepared
to
meet
them
in
the
land
of
Jershon
.
Now
the
leader
of
the
Nephites
,
or
the
man
which
had
heen
appointed
to
be
the
Chief
Captain
over
the
Nephites
:
ow
the
Chief
Captain
took
the
command
of
all
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
;
and
his
name
was
Moroni
;
and
Moroni
.
all
the
command
,
and
the
governments
of
their
wars
.—
dhe
was
only
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
was
ap
Pointed
Chicf
Commander
over
the
armies
of
the
N
eplites
.
,
Andit
came
to
pass
that
he
met
the
Lamanites
in
the
borders
of
Jershon
,
and
his
people
were
armed
with
swords
,
and
Witheimeters
,
and
all
manner
of
weapons
of
war
.
And
it
Gime
to
pass
,
that
when
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
saw
that
[File:346]
the
people
of
Nephi
,
or
that
Moroni
had
prepared
his
pedple
with
breast

plates
,
and
with
arm

shiclds
;
yea
,
and
also
-
shields
:
to
defend
their
heads
;
and
also
they
were
dressed
with
thick
clothing
.
Now
the
army
of
Zerahemnah
was
not
prepared
with
any
such
thing
.
They
had
only
their
swords
,
and
their
cimeters
,
their
bows
and
their
arrows
,
their
stones
and
their
slings
;
but
they
were
naked
,
save
it
were
a
skin
which
was
girded
about
their
loins
;
yea
,
all
were
naked
,
saveitwere
the
Zoramites
and
the
Amalekites
.
But
they
were
not
armed
with
breast
-
plates
,
nor
shields
;
therefore
they
were
exceed
ing
afraid
of
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
,
because
of
their
av
mour
,
notwithstanding
their
number
being
so
much
greater
than
the
Nephites
.
Behold
,
now
it
came
to
pass
,
that
they
durst
not
come
against
the
Nephites
in
the
borders
of
Jershon
;
therefore
they
departed
out
of
the
land
of
Antionum
,
into
the
wilderness
,
and
ak
their
journey
round
about
in
the
wilderness
,
away
by
the
head
of
the
river
Sidon
,
that
they
might
come
into
the
land
of
Manti
,
and
take
possession
of
the
land
;
for
they
dif
not
suppose
that
the
armies
of
Moroni
would
know
whither
they
had
gone
.
But
it
came
to
pass
,
as
soon
as
they
had
de
:
parted
into
the
wildemess
,
Moroni
sent
spies
into
ihe
wilder
ness
,
to
watch
their
carnp
;
and
Moroni
,
also
,
knowing
of
the
prophecies
of
Alma
,
sent
certain
men
unto
bim
,
desiring
hint
that
he
should
inquire
of
the
Lord
whither
the
armies
of
the
Nev
phites
should
go
,
to
defend
themselves
against
the
Lamanites
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
word
of
the
Lord
canie
unto
Almay
and
Alma
informed
the
messengers
of
Moroni
that
the
armies
ot
the
Lamanites
were
marching
round
about
in
the
wilderness
,
that
they
might
come
over
into
the
land
of
Manti
,
that
they
might
commence
an
attack
upon
the
more
weak
part
of
the
people
And
those
messengers
went
and
delivered
the
message
unto
Moroni
.
Now
Moroni
,
leaving
a
part
of
his
army
in
the
land
of
Jer
~
shon
,
lest
by
any
means
,
a
part
of
the
Lamanites
should
come
into
that
land
and
take
possession
of
the
city
;
and
Moroni
took
the
remainder
part
of
his
army
and
marched
over
into
fhe
land
of
Manti
.
And
he
caused
that
all
the
people
in
thit
quarter
of
the
land
,
should
gather
themselves
together
to
battle
,
against
the
Lamanites
,
to
defend
their
tands
and
their
counlry
,
their
rights
and
their
liberties
;
therefore
they
were
prepared
against
the
time
of
the
coming
ofthe
Lamanites
.
And
it
cable
to
pass
,
that
Moroni
caused
that
his
army
should
be
secreted
[File:347]
inthe
valley
which
was
near
the
bank
of
the
riyer
Sidon
,
which
was
on
the
west
of
the
river
Sidon
,
in
the
wilderness
.
And
Moroni
placed
spies
round
about
,
that
he
might
know
iyhen
the
camp
of
the
Lamanites
should
come
,
And
now
as
Moroni
knew
the
intention
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
it
was
their
intention
to
destroy
their
brethren
,
or
to
subject
them
and
bring
them
into
bondage
,
that
they
might
esiablish
a
kingdom
unto
themselves
,
over
all
the
Jand
;
and
healso
knowing
that
it
was
the
only
desire
of
the
Nephites
lo
reserve
their
lands
and
their
liberty
,
and
their
church
,
therefore
he
thought
it
no
sin
that
he
should
defend
them
by
stratagem}
;
therefore
he
found
,
by
his
spies
,
which
course
the
Lamanites
rere
to
take
,
Therefore
he
divided
his
army
,
and
brought
a
put
over
into
the
valley
,
and
concealed
them
on
the
east
,
and
othe
south
of
the
hill
Riplah
;
and
the
remainder
he
convealed
in
the
west
valley
,
on
the
west
of
the
river
Sidon
,
and
so
.
down
into
the
borders
of
the
land
Manti
.
And
thus
having
placed
his
army
according
to
his
desire
,
he
was
prepared
to
meet
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
came
up
on
the
worth
of
the
hill
where
part
of
the
army
of
Moroni
was
concealed
,
And
it
came
to
.
pass
that
as
the
Lamanites
had
pass
ed
the
hill
Riplah
,
and
came
into
the
valley
,
and
began
to
toss
the
riyer
Sidon
,
the
army
which
was
concealed
on
the
south
of
the
hill
,
who
was
led
bya
man
whose
name
was
Leli
;
and
he
ted
his
army
forth
and
encircled
the
Lamanites
about
,
on
the
east
,
in
their
rear
.
eae
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
,
when
they
saw
the
Nephites
coming
tipon
them
in
their
rear
,
tarned
them
about
,
ad
began
to
contend
with
the
army
of
Lehi
;
and
the
work
of
death
commenced
,
on
both
sides
;
bat
it
was
more
dreadful
h
the
part
of
the
Lamanites
;
for
their
nakedness
was
expoted
to
the
heavy
blows
of
the
Nephites
,
with
their
swords
aid
their
cimeters
,
which
,
brought
death
alniost
at
every
stroke
;
while
on
the
other
hand
,
there'
was
now
and
then
a
nan
fell
among
the
Nepbites
,
by
their
swords
,
and
the
loss
of
tlood
;
they
being
shielded
from
the
more
vital
parts
of

hody
,
or
the
more

parts
of

of
the
Lamanites
,
by
their

,
and

,
and
their

;
and
thus
the
Nephites

carry
on
the
work
of
death
among
the
Lamanites
.
And
me
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
became
frightened
,
because

among

hi
and
his
men
,
and
they
were
driven
by
Lebi
into
the
wates
of
Sidon
;
and
they
crossed
the
waters
of
Sidon
.
And
Lehj
retained
his
armies
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
Sidon
,
tha
they
should
not
cross
,
a
And
it
came
to
pays
that
Moroni
and
his
army
met
the
La
manites
in
the
valley
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
Sidone
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
and
his
army
began
to
fall
upon
them
,
and
toslay
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
flee
again
before
them
,
towards
the
land
gp
Manti
;
and
they
were
met
again
by
the
armies
of
Moronin
Now
in
this
case
,
the
Lamanites
did
fight
exceedingly
;
yea
never
had
the
Lanianites
been
known
to
have
fought
with
suc
exceeding
great
strength
and
courage
;
no
,
not
even
from
tle
beginning
;
und
they
were
inspired
by
the
Zoramites
,
and
the
Amalekites
,
which
were
their
Chief
Captains
and
leader
and
by
Zerahcmmah
,
who
was
their
Chief
Captain
,
or
thay
:
chief
leader
and
commander
;
yea
,
they
did
fight
like
dragons
;
and
many
of
the
Nephites
were
slain
by
their
hands
;
yea
,
fp
they
did
smite
in
two
many
of
their
head
-
plates
;
and
they
dif
pierce
many
of
their
breast
-
plates
;
and
they
did
smite
of
many
of
their
arms
;
and
thas
the
Lamanites
did
smite
their
fierce
anger
.
Nevertheless
,
the
Nephites
were
inspint
by
a
better
cause
;
for
they
were
not
fighting
for
monarely
nor
power
;
but
they
were
fighting
for
their
homes
,
and
ther
liberties
,
their
wives
,
and
their
children
,
and
their
all
;
yea
for
their
rites
of
worship
,
and
their
church
;
and
they
wen
doing
that
which
they
felt
it
was
the
duty
which
they
owedto
their
God
;
for
the
Lord
had
said
unto
them
)
and
also
unto
their
fathers
,
That
inasmuch
as
ye
are
not
guilty
of
the
tint
offence
,
neither
the
second
,
ye
shall
not
suffer
yoursclves
be
slain
by
the
hands
of
your
enemies
.
And
again
:
The
Lord
hath
said
That
ye
shall
defend
your
families
,
even
unio
bloodshed
;
therefore
,
for
this
cause
were
the
Nephites
cole
tending
with
the
Jamanites
,
to
defend
themselves
,
and
thet
families
,
and
their
lands
,
their
country
,
and
their
rights
,
all
their
religion
.
i
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
men
of
Moroni
sat
the
fiercencss
and
the
anger
of
the
Lamanites
,
they
were
about
to
shrink
and
flee
from
them
.
And
Moroni
,
perceiving
thet
intent
,
sent
forth
and
inspired
their
hearts
with
these
thoughts
;
yea
,
the
thoughts
of
their
lands
,
their
liberty
,
yea
,
hea
dom
from
bondage
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
fu

jgon
the
Lamanites
,
and
they
cried
with
one
voice
unto
the
Jord
their
God
,
for
their
liberty
,
and
their
freedom
from
bonface
.
And
they
began
to
stand
against
the
Lamanites
with
yer
;
and
in
that
self
-
same
hour
that
they
cried
unto
the
dord
for
their
freedom
,
the
Lamanites
began
to
flee
before
em
;
and
they
fled
even
to
the
waters
of
Sidon
.
Now
the
jamanites
were
more
numerous
;
yea
,
by
more
than
double
genumber
of
the
Nephites
;
nevertheless
,
they
were
driven
gsomuch
that
they
were
gathered
together
in
one
body
,
in
ie
valley
,
upon
the
bank
,
by
.
the
river
Sidon
;
therefore
the
mies
of
Moroni
encircled
them
about
;
yea
,
even
on
both
sive
of
the
river
;
for
behold
,
on
the
east
,
were
the
men
of
jehi
;
therefore
when
Zerahemnah
saw
the
men
of
Lehi
on
the
east
of
the
river
Sidon
,
and
the
armies
of
Moroni
on
the
nest
of
the
river
Sidon
,
that
they
were
encircled
about
.
by
the
Nephites
,
they
were
struck
with
terror
.
Now
Moroni
,
whem
je
saw
their
terror
,
he
commanded
bis
men
that
they
shoule
sop
shedding
their
blood
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
stop
,
and
withdrew
a
from
them
.
And
-
Moroni
said
unto
Zerahemnah
,
Behold
,
Zerahemnab
,
that
we
do
not

yea
,
and
the
is

;
I
command

by

that

And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Zerahemnah
had
heay
these
sayings
,
he
came
forth
and
delivered
up
his

his

,
and
his

,
into

hands
of

unto

Behold

we

we
know

but
take

and

that

may
depart
into

wilderness
;
otherwise
we
will
retain
or

,
and
we
will
perish
or

,
Behold
,
we
are
noted

;
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is

that
hath

And
nom
when
Zeraemnah
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
these
words
Moronireturned
the
sword
,
and
the
weapons
of

whiehhe
had
received
,
unto
,
Zerahemnah
,
saying
,
Behold
,
we

Now
I
cannot
retain
the
words
which
I
hav
spoken
;
therefore
,
as
the
Lord
liveth
,
ye
shall
not
depul
except
ye
depart
with
an

,
that
ye

Now
as
ye

we

or
ye
shall

T

proposed

And
now
when
Moroni
lal
said
these
words
,
Zerahemnah
retained
his
sword
,
and
he
wi
angry
with
Moroni
,
andshe
rushed
forward
that
he
might
sit
Moroni
;
but
ashe
raised
his
syvord
,
belold
,
one
of
Morons
soldiers
smote
it
even
to
the
earth
;
and
it
broke
by
the
hilt
;
ail
he
also
smote
Zerahemnah
,
that
he
took
off
his
scalp
,
andt
fell
to
the
earth
.
And
Zeraherunal
withdrew
from
belo
them
,
into
the
nidst
of
his
soldiers
.
:
x
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
soldier
which
stood
by
,
whith
smote
off
the
scalp
of
Zerahemnahtoolk
up
the
scalp
from
a
the
ground
,
by
the
hair
,
and
laid
it
upon
the
point
of
his
ewan
[File:351]
i
al
stretched
it
forth
unto
them
,
saying
unto
them
with
a
loud
ice
,
saying
:
Even
as
this
scalp
hath
fallen
to
the
earth
,
ghich
is
the
scalp
of
your
Chief
,
so
shall
ye

acept
ye
Will

,
and

gith

i
.
Now
there
were
many
,
when
they
heard
these
words
,
and
aw
the
scalp
which
was
upon
the
sword
,
they
were
struck
sith
fear
,
and
many
came
forth
and
threw
.
down
their
weapan
of
war
,
at
the
feet
of
Moroni
,
and
entered
into
a
covenant
peace
.
And
as
many
as
entered
into
a
covenant
,
they
suffred
to
depart
into
the
wilderness
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
Zerahemnah
was
exceeding
wroth
,
adhe
did
stir
up
the
remainder
of
his
soldiers
to
,
anger
,
to
woteud
more
powerfully
against
the
Nephites
..
And
now
Voroni
was
angry
,
because
of
the
stubbornness
of
the
:
Laomites
;
therefore
he
commanded
his
people
that
they
should
.
all
upon
them
and
slay
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
ian
to
slay
them
;
yea
,
and
the
Lamanites
did
contend
with
ir
swords
and
their
mights
.
But
behold
,
their
naked
skins
,
ud
their
bare
heads
,
were
exposed
to
the
sharp
swords
of
ihe
Nephites
;
yea
,
behold
,
they
were
pierced
and
smitten
;
jeu
,
and
did
fall
exceeding
fast
before
the
swords
of
the
Nejliies
;
and
they
began
to
be
swept
down
,
even
as
the
soldir
of
Moroni
had
prophesied
.
Now
Zerahemnah
,
when
hesaw
that
they
were
all
about
to

And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
ninctcenth
year
of
the
reign
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
that
Alma
came
uniofy
son
Helaman
,
and
saith
unto
him
,
Believest

the
wor
which
I
spake
unto
thee
concerning

which

And
Helaman
saith
unto
him
,
Yea
,
I
believ
,—
And
Alma
saith
again
,
Believest
uiow
in
Jesus
Christ
,
whid
shall
come
?
And
he
saith
,
Yea
,
believe
all
the
words
which
thou
hast
spoken
.
And
Alma
saith
unto
him
again
,
Wile
keep
my
commandments
?
And
he
said
,
Yea
,
1
will
kep
thy

.
Then
Almaailh
unto
him
,
Blessed
art
thou
;
and
the
Lord
shall
prosper
the
in
this
land
.
But
behold
,
T
have
somewhat
to
prohesy
uni
thee
;
but
what
I
prophesy
unto
thee
,
ye
shall
not

Known
:
yea
,
what
I
prophesy
unto
thee
shall
not
be
made
knom
even
until
the
prophecy
is
fulilled
;
therefore
write
the
wank
which
T
shall
say
.
And
these
are
the
words
:
Behoid
,
I
per
ceive
that'
this
.
very
people
,
the
Nephites
,
according
tothe
spiritiof
revelation
which
is
in
me
,
in
four
hundred
yearsfwum
the
time
that
Jesus
Christ
shall
raanifest
himself
unto
thet
,
shall
dwindle
in
unbelief
;
yea
,
and
then
shall
they
see
was
and
:
pestilences
,
yea
,
famines
and
.
bloodshed
,
even
until
{ht
people
of
Nephi
shall
become
extinet
;
yea
,
and
this
becaus
they
shall
dwindle
in
unbelicf
,
and
fall
into
the
works
of
det
ness
and
lasciviousness
,
and
all
manner
of
iniquitics
;
yea
,
say
unto
you
,
that
because
they
shall
sin
against
so
gril
light
and
knowledge
;
yea
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
from
that
day
,
even
the
fourth
generation
shall
not
all
pass
away
,
before
this
great
iniquity
shall
come
;
and
when
that
great
day
cometh
,
behold
,
the
time
very
soon
cometh
that
those
which
are
20%
or
the
seed
of
those
which
are
Bow
numbered
among
the
ooo
people
of
Nephi
,
shall
no
more
be
numbered
among
tlt
[File:353]
Je
of
Nephi
;
but
whosoever
remaincth
,
and
is
not
destoyed
in
that
great
and
dreadful
day
,
shall
be
numbered
among
he
Lamanites
,
and
shall
become
like
unto
them
all
,
save
it
jeafew
,
which
shall
be
called
the
disciples
of
the
Lord
;
and
hem
shall
the
Lamanites
pursue
,
even
until
they
shall
become
tinct
.
And
now
,
because
of
iniquity
,
this
prophecy
shall
be
fulfilled
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Alma
lad
said
these
things
to
Helama
,
he
blessed
him
,
and
also
his
other
sons
;
wl
be
also
blessed
the
earth
,
for
the
mghteous'
sake
.
And
hie
ail
,
Thus
saith
the
Lord
God
;
Cursed
shalt
be
the
land
,
yea
,
ihigland
,
uuto
every
nation
,
kindred
,
tongue
,
and
people
,
unto
estruction
,
which
do
wickedly
,
when
they
are
fully
ripe
;
and
aT
have
said
,
so
shall
it
be
:
for
this
is
the
cursing
and
the
sessing
of
God
upon
the
land
,
for
the
Lord
cannot
look
upon
go
with
the
least
degree
of
allowance
.
And
now
,
when
Alm
had
said
these
words
,
he
blessed
the
church
,
yea
,
alt
hose
which
should
stand
fast
in
the
faith
,
from
that
time
jecelorth
;
and
when
Alma
had
done
this
,
he
departed
out'
ithe
land
of
Zarabemla
,
as
if
to
go
into
the
land
of
Melek
.—
dnd
it
vame
to
pass
that
he
was
never
heard
of
mere
;
as
to
Ys
death
or
his
burial
,
we
know
not
of
.
Behold
,
this
we
fnow
,
that
he
was
a
righteous
man
;
and
the
saying
went
dtoad
in
the
church
,
that
he
wes
taken
up
by
the
spinit
,
or
buried
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
even
as
Moses
.
But
behold
,
the
Scripture
saith
the
Lord
togk
Moses
unto
hinself
;
and
we
snppose
that
he
hath
also
received
Alma
in
the
spirit
,
unto
himself
;
therefore
,
for
this
cause
,
we
know
nothing
concerting
his
death
and
burial
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
nineteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
af
Nephi
,
that
-
Helaman
went
forth
among
the
people
(
o
declare
the
Word
unto
them
:
for
behold
,
because
of
their
wars
with
the
lamanites
,
and
the
many
little
dissentions
and
disturbanecs
Which
had
been
among
the
people
,
it
hecame
expedient
thai
,
the
word
of
God
should
be
declared
among
them
;
yea
,
and
flat
@
regiation
should
be
made
throughout
the
chureh
;
therefore
Helaman'
and
his
brethren
went
forth
to
establish
the
church
aan
in
all
the
Jand
,
yea
,
in
every
city
throughout
all
the
land
which
was
possessed
by
the
people
of
Nephi
,
And
ame
to
pass
that
they
did
appoint
,
priests
and
teachers
fitoiehoar
atthe
land
,
oyer
all
the
charches
.
¥/
And
wow
it
came
to
pass
that
after
[Tclaman
and
his
breth
[File:354]
ren
had
appointed
priests
and
teachers
over
the
churches
,
ti
there
arose
a
dissention
among
them
,
and
they
would
Noteip
heed
to
the
words
of
Melaman
aud
his
brethren
;
but
they
gm
proud
,
being
lifted
up
in
their
hearts
;
because
of
their
ex
mig
great
riches
;
therefore
they
grew
rich
in
their
owne
and
would
not
give
heed
to
their
words
,
to
walk
uprightly
fore
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
many
as
would
not
hearke
,
the
words
of
Helaman
and
his
brethren
,
were
gathered
f
ft
er
against
their
brethren
.
And
now
behold
,
they
were
exg
ing
wroth
,
insomuch
that
they
were
determined
to
slay
the
Now
the
leader
of
those
which
were
wroth
against
their
bret
ren
,
was
a
large
and
a
strong
man
;
and
his
name
was
4p
lickiah
.
And
Amalickiah
was
desirous
to
be
a
king
:
q
those
people
which
were
wroth
,
were
2lso
desirous
thal
should
be
their
king
;
unl
they
were
the
greater
part
ofthe
the
lower
Judges
of
tie
land
;
and
they
were
seeking
for
po

er
.
And
they
had
been
led
by
the
flatteries
of
Atualickia
that
if
they
would
support
him
,
and
establish
him
to
be
th

king
,
that
he
would
make

rulers
over
the
people

Th
they
were
Ied

by
Amalickiah
,
to
dissentions

Pricsts
over

And
theres
many
in
the
chureh
which
believed
in
the
flattering
words
:
Amalickiah
;
therefore
they
dissented
even
from

the
chue
and
thus
were
the
affairs
of
the
people
of
Nephi
exctuiy
precarious
and
dangerous
,
notwithstanding
their
great
viet
which
they
had
had
over

,
and
their
great
me
cings
which
they
had
had
,
because
of
their
deliverance

hands
of
the
Lord

Thus
we
see
how
quick
the
childwnr

doth
forget
the
Lord
their
God
:
yea
,
how
quick
tot
iniquity
,

hecause
he
was
a
man
of
cunning

,
and
aml
of
many
flattering
words
,
thai
he
led
away
the
hearts
of

to

wickedly
;
yea

and
toscek
to

unto
them
,
or
which
blessing
God
had
sent
ut
the
face

,
for

suke
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Moroni
,
which
was
chief
commander
of
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
,
had
let
[File:355]
of
these
dissentions
,
he
was
angry
with
Amalickiah
.
'
<And
it
,
came
to
pass
that
he
rent
his
coat
;
and
he
iook

,
and
wrole
upon
it
,
In

,
and
our

,
our

,
and
our
children
;
and
he
fsiened
it
upon
the
end
of
a
pole
thereof
.
And
he
fastened
m
his
headsplate
,
and
his
breast

plate
,
and
his
shields
,
and
grded
on
bis
armour
about

loins
;
and
he
took
the
pole
,
which
had
on
the
end
thereof
his
rent
coat
,
(
and
be
called
it
the
title
of
liberty
,)
and
he
bowed
himsel
!
'
to
the
earth
,
and
he
prayed
mightily
unto
bis
God
for
the
blessings
of
liberty
forest
upon
his
prethren
so
loug
as
there
should
a
band
of
Christians
remain
to
possess
the
land
:
for
thus
were
all
the
tne
believers
of
Christ
,
which
belonged
to
the
church
of
God
,
called
,
by
those
which
did
not
belong
to
the
church
;
and
those
who
did
belong
to
the
church
,
were
faithful
;
yea
,
all
}
those
who
were
true
believers
in
Christ
,
took
npon
them
,
dadly
,
the
name
of
Christ
,
or
Christians
,
as
they
were
called
,
because
of
their
belief
in
Christ
,
which
should
come
;
end
therefore
.
at
this
time
,
Moroni
prayed
that
the
canse
of
the
Chrstiens
,
and
the
freedom
of
the
land
,
might
be
fayored
.—
~
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
poured
out
his
soul
lo
God
,
he
gave
all
the
land
which
was
south
of
the
land
.
Desolation
;
yea
,
and
in
fine
,
all
the
land
,
both
on
the
north
and
.
on
the
south
,
a
chosen
land
,
and
the
land
of
liberty
,
—,
And
he
saith
,
Surely
God
shall
not
suffer
that
we
,
who
are~
despised
because
we
take
upon
us
the
name
of
Christ
,
shall
Aetrodden
down
and
destroyed
,
until
we
bring
it
upon
us
,
Ly
or
own
transgressions
.
And
when
Moroni
had
said
these
words
,
he
went
forth
among
the
people
,
waving
the
rent
of
his
gament
in
the
air
,
that
allfinight
see
the
writing
which
he
had
wrote
upon
the
rent
,
and
erying
with
a
loud
voice
,
saying
:

,
whosoever
wil

maintain
this

,
let
hem
come
forth
in
the
strength

Lord
,

enter
into

covenant
(
hat
they
will
maintain
their
rights
,
and
their
religion
,
that
the
Lord
God
may
bless
them
.
And
it
caine
to
pass
that
when
Moroni
had
proclaimed
these
words
,
behold
,
the
people
came
running
together
,
with
their
armours
girded
about
their
loins
,
resding
their
garments

as
a

that
they
would
not

and
be

this
was
the
covenant
which
they
made
;
and
they
cast
they
garments
at
the
feet
of
Moroni
,
saying
:
We

that

would
stir
up
the
Lamanites
to
anger
against
them
,
and
cause
them
to
come
to

against
them
;
and
this
he
knew
that
Amalickiah
would
do
,
that
he
might
obtain
his
purposes
;
therefore
Moroni
thought
it
was
expedient
that
he
should

armies
,
which
had
gathered
themselves
together
,
and
armed
themselves

And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
took
his
army
,
and
marched
out
info
the
wilderness
,
to
cut
off
the
course
of
Amalickiah
in
the
wilderness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
according
to
his
desires
,
and
marched
forth
into
the
wilderness
,
and
headed
the
armies
of
Amalickiah
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
fled
with
a
small
number
of
his
men
,
and
the
remainder
were
delivered
up
into
the
bands
of
Moroni
,
and
were
taken
back
into
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
Now
Moroni

a
man
which

the

people
,
therefore
fe
had

according
to
his
will
,
with
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
,
to
establish
and
to
exercise
authority
over
them
.
And
it
came
10
pass
that
whomsoever
of
the
Amalickiahites
that
would
not
enter
into
a
covenant
to
support
the
cause
of
freedom
,
that
they
might
maintain
a
free
government
,
he
caused
to
be
put
to
death
;
and
there
was
but
few
which
denied
the
covenant
of
freedom
.
And
it
came
to
pass
also
,
that
he
caused
the
title
of
liberty
fo
be
hoisted
upon
every
tower
which
was
in
all

Jand
,
which
was
possessed

thus

the
standard

And
they

And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
who
died
,
firmly
believing
that
their
souls
were
redeemed
by
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
;
thus
they
went

And
there
_
Were
some
who
died

fevers

scasotis

very
frequent
in

not

with
him
,
and
went
up
into
the
land
of
Nephi
,
among
the
La
manites
,
and
did
stir
up
the
Lamanites
to
anger
,
against
the
people
of
Nephi
,
insomuch
that
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
sent
2
proclamation
throughout
all
his
land
,
among
all
his
People
,
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
again
,
to
go
tg
battle
against
the
Nephites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
proclamation
had
gone
forth
among
them
,
they
were
exceeding
fraid
;
yea
,
they
feared
to
displease
the
king
,
and
they
also
feared
to
go
to
batle
against
the
Nephites
,
lest
they
should
lose
-
their
lives
.
Andit
came
to
pass
that
they
would
uot
,
or
the
more
part
of
them
would
not
obey
the
commandments
of
the
king
,
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
was
wroth
,
because
of
their
disobedience
;
therefore
he
gave
Amalickiah
the
com
mand
of
that
part
of
his
army
which
was
cbedient
unto
his
commands
,
and
commanded
him
that
he
should
go
forth
and
compel
them
to
arms
.
Now
behold
,
this
was
the
desire
of
Amalickiah
:
for
he
being
a
very
subile
man
to
do
evil
,
ther
.
fore
he
laid
the
plan
in
his
heart
to
dethrone
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
now
he
had
got
the
command
of
those
paris
of
the
Lamanites
which
were
in
favor
of
the
king
;
and
be
sought
to
gain
favor
of
those
which
were
not
obedient
;
there
:
fore
he
went
forward
to
the
place
which
was
called
Onidah
,
for
thither
had
all
the
Lamanites
fled
;
for
they
discovered
the
ariny
coming
,
and
supposing
that
they
were
coming
to
destmy
them
,
therefore
they
fled
to
Onidah
,
to
the
place
of
arms
.—
And
they
had
appointed
a
man
to
he
a
king
and
a
leader
over
them
,
being
fixed
in
their
minds
with
a
determined
resolution
that
they
would
not
be
subjected
to
go
against
the
Nephites
.
and
it
came
to
pass
that
they
had
gathered
themselves
te
gether
upon
the
top
of
the
mount
which
was
called
Antipas
,
in
preparation
to
battle
.
Now
it
was
not
Amalickiah's
intention
to
give
them
battle
,
according
to
the
commandments
of
the
king
;
but
behold
,
it
was
his
intention
to
gain
favor
with
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
he
might
place
bimself
at
their
head
,
and
dethrone
the
king
,
and
take
possession
of
the
kingdom
.
And
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
he
caused
his
army
0
pitch
their
tents
in
the
valley
which
was
near
the
mount
Anltipas
,
And
it
came
to

that
when
it
was

,

of
those
which
were
upon
the
mount
,
whose
name
was
Lebonti
,
that
he
should
come
down
to
the
foot
of
the
mount
,
for
he
desired
to
speak
with
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Lehonti
received
the
message
,
he
durst
not
go
down
to
the
foot
of
the
monnt
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
sent
again
the
second
time
,
desing
him
to
come
down
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Lehonti
would
not
;
and
he
sent
again
the
third
time
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Amalickiah
found
that
he
could
not
get
Lehonti
tocome
down
off
from
the
mount
,
he
went
up
into
the
mount
,
nearly
to
Lehont's
camp
;
and
he
sent
again
the
fourth
time
,
his
message
unto
Lehonti
,
desiring
that
he
would
come
down
,
and
that
he
would
bring
his
guards
with
him
.
And
it
came
to
puss
that
when
Lehonti
had
come
down
with
his
guards
to
Amalickiah
,
that
Amalickiab
desired
him
fo
come
down
with
his
army
in
the
night
time
,
and
surround
those
men
in
their
camps
,
over
whom
the
king
had
gave
him
command
,
and
that
he
would
deliver
them
up
into
Lehonti's
hands
,
if
he
would
make
him
,
(
Amalickiah
,)
a
second
leader
over
the
whole
army
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Lehonti
came
down
with
his
men
,
and
surrounded
the
men
of
Amalickiah
,
so
that
before
they
awoke
at
the
dawn
of
the
day
,
they
were
surrounded
by
the
amies
of
Lehonti
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
saw
that
they
were
surrounded
,
they
plead
with
Amalickiah
that
he
would
suffer
them
to
fall
in
with
their
brethren
,
that
they
might
not
be
destroyed
.
Now
this
was
the
very
thing
which
Amalickiah
desired
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
delivered
his
men
,
contrary
tothe
commands
of
the
king
.
Now
this
was
the
thing
that
Amalickiah
desired
,
that
he
might
accomplish
his
designs
in
dethroning
the
king
.
Now
it
was
the
custom
among
the
Lamanics
,
if
their
chief
leader
was
killed
,
to
appoint
the
second
leader
to
be
their
chief
leader
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
caused
that
one
of
his
servants
should
administer
poison
,
by
degrees
,
to
Lehonti
,
that
he
died
.
Now
when'
Lehonti
was
dead
,
the
Lamanites
appointed
Amalickiah
to
be
their
Ieader
and
their
chief
commander
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
marched
with
his
armies
(
for
he
had
gained
his
desires
)
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
to
the
cily
of
Nephi
,
which
was
the
chief
city
.
And
the
king
eame
outto
meet
him
,
with
his
guards
:
for
he
supposed
that
Amalickiah
bad
fulfilled
his
commands
,
and
that
Amalickiah
[File:360]
had
gathered
together
so
great
an
army
for
to
go
against
the
Nephiles
to
battle
.
But
behold
,
as
the
king
came
out
to
mee
,
him
,
Amalickiah
caused
that
his
servants
should
go
forth
tg
meet
the
king
.
And
they
went
and
bowed
themselves
before
the
king
,
as
if
to
reverence
him
,
because
of
his
greatness
—
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
put
forth
his
hand
to
raise
them
,
as
was
the
custom
with
the
Lamanites
,
and
a
token
of
peace
,
which
custom
they
had
taken
from
the
Nephites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
raised
the
first
from
the
ground
,
behold
,
he
stabbed
the
king
to
ihe
heart
;
and
he
fell
to
the
earth
.
Now
the
servants
of
the
king
fled
;
and
the
ser
.
vants
of
Amalickiah
raised
a
cry
,
saying
:
Behold
,
the
servants
of
the
king
have
stabbed
him
to
the
heart
,
and
he
has
fell
,
and
they
have
fied
;
behold
,
come
and
see
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
commanded
that
his
armies
should
march
forth
,
and
see
what
had
happened
to
the
king
;
and
when
they
had
come
to
the
spot
,
and
found
the
king
lyingin
his
gore
,
Amalickiah
pretended
to
be
wroth
,
and
said
,
Whosoever
loved
the
king
,
let
him
go
forth
and
pursue
lis
servants
,
that
they
may
be
slain
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
all
they
who
loved
the
king
,
when
they
heard
these
words
,
came
forth
and
pursued
after
the
servants
of
the
king
.
Now
when
the
servants
of
the
king
saw
an
army
pursuing
after
them
,
they
were
frightened
agaty
,
and
fled
into
the
wilderness
,
and
came
over
into
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
joined
the
people
of
Ammon
;
and
the
amy
which
pursued
after
them
,
returned
,
having
pursued
after
them
in
vain
:
and
thus
Amatickiah
,
by
his
fraud
,
gained
the
hearts
of
the
people
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
,
he
entered
the
city
Nephi
,
with
his
armies
,
and
took
possession
of
the
city
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
queen
,
when
she
had
heard
that
the
king
was
slain
:
for
Amalickial
had
sent
an
embassy
to
the
queen
,
informing
her
that
the
king
had
been
stain
by
his
servants
;
that
he
had
pursued
them
with
his
army
,
but
it
was
in
vain
,
and
they
had
made
their
escape
:
Therefore
when
the
queen
had
received
this
message
,
she
sent
unto
Amalickizh
,
desiring
him
that
he
would
spare
the
people
of
the
city
;
and
she
also
desired
him
that
he
should
come
in
unto
her
;
and
she
also
desired
him
that
he
should
bring
witnesses
with
hin
,
to
testify
concerning
the
death
of
the
king
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
took
the
same
servant
that
slew
the
king
,
and
also
they
which
were
with
him
,
ad
[File:361]
went
in
unto
the
queen
,
unto
the
place
where
she
sat
;
and
they
all
testified
unto
her
that
the
king
was
slain
by
his
own
servants
;
and
they
said
,
also
,
They
have
fled
:
Does
not
this
iestify
against
them
?
And
thus
they
satisfied
the
queen
concerning
the
death
of
the
king
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
sought
the
favor
of
the
queen
,
and
took
her
unto
him
to
wife
;
and
thus
by
his
fraud
,
and
hy
the
assistance
of
his
cunning
servants
,
he
obtained
the
kingdom
;
yea
,
he
was
acknowledged
king
throughout
all
the
land
,
among
all
the
people
of
the
Lamanites
,
which
was
com
osed
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
the
Lemuelites
,
and
the
Ishmaeltes
,
and
all
the
dissenters
of
the
Nephites
,
from
the
reign
of
Nephi
down
to
the
present
time
.
Now
these
dissenters
,
having
the
same
instruction
and
the
same
information
of
the
Nephites
;
yea
,
having
been
instructed
in
the
same
Imowledge
of
the
Lord
;
nevertheless
,
it
is
strange
to
relate
,
not
jong
after
their
dissentions
,
they
became
more
hardened
and
impenitent
,
and
more
wild
,
wicked
and
ferocious
,
than
the
Lamanites
;
drinking
in
with
the
traditions
of
the
Lamanites
;
giving
way
to
indolence
,
and
all
manner
of
lasciviousness
;
yea
,
entirely
forgeting
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
as
soon
as
Amalickiah
had
obtained
the
kingdom
,
be
began
to
inspire
the
hearts
of
the
Lamanites
against
the
people
of
Nephi
;
yea
,
he
did
appoint
men
to
speak
unto
the
Lamanites
from
their
towers
,
against
the
Nephites
;
and
thus
he
did
inspire
their
hearts
against
the
Nephites
,
insomuch
,
that
in
the
latter
end
of
the
nineteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
,
he
having
accomplished
his
designs
thus
far
;
yea
,
having
been
made
king
over
the
Lamanites
,
he
sought
also
to
reign
over
all
the
land
;
yea
,
and
all
the
people
which
were
in
the
land
;
the
Nephites
as
well
as
the
Lamanites
;
therefore
he
had
accomplished
his
design
;
for
he
had
hardened
the
hearts
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
blinded
thelr
minds
,
and
stirred
them
up
to
anger
,
insomuch
that
he
had
gathered
together
a
numerous
host
,
to
go
to
battle
against
the
Nephites
.
For
he
was
determined
,
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
number
of
his
people
,
to
overpower
the
Nephites
,
and
to
bring
them
into
bondage
;
and
thus
he
did
appoint
Chief
Captains
of
the
Zoramites
,
they
being
the
most
acquainted
with
the
strength
of
the
Nephites
,
and
their
places
of
resort
,
and
the
weakest
parts
of
their
cities
;
therefore
he
appointed
them
tobe
Chief
Captains
over
his
armies
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
their
camp
,
and
moved
[File:362]
forth
towards
dhe
land
of
Zarahemla
,
in
the
wilderness
.
Noy
it
came
to

sort
;
throwing
up
banks
of
earth
round
about
,
to
enclose
his
armies
,
and
also
building
walls
of
stone
to
encircle
them
about
,
round
about
their
cities
,
and
the
borders
of
their
lands
;
yea
,
all
round
about
the
land
;
and
in
their
weakest
fortifications
,
he
did
place
the
greater
number
of
men
;
and
thus
he
did
fori
and
strengthen
the
land
which
was
possessed
by
the
Nephites
,
And
thus
he
was
preparing
to
support
their
liberty
,
their
lands
,
their
wives
,
and
their
children
,
and
their
peace
,
and
that
they
might
live
unto
the
Lord
their
God
,
and
that
they
might
main
.
tain
that
which
was
called
by
their
enemies
the
cause
of
Chris
tans
.
And
Moroni
was
a
strong
and
a
mighty
man
;
hie
was
a
mau
of
a
perfect
understanding
;
yea
,
a
man
that
did
notde
.
light
in
bloodshed
;
a
man
whose
soul
did
joy
in
the
liberiy
and
the
freedom
of
his
country
,
and
his
brethren
from
bondage
and
slavery
;
yea
,
a
man
whose
heart
did
swell
with
thanks
.
giving
to
bis
God
,
for
the
many
privileges
and
blessings
which
he
bestowed
upon
his
people
;
a
man
who
did
labor
exceedingly
for
the
welfare
and
safety
of
his
people
;
yea
,
and
he
was
aman
who
was
firm
in
the
faith
of
Christ
,
and
he
had
sworn
with
an
oath
,
to
defend
his
people
,
his
rights
,
and
his
country
,
and
his
religion
,
even
to
the
loss
of
his
blood
.
Now
the
Nephites
were
taught
to
defend
themselves
against
their
enemies
,
even
to
the
shedding
of
blood
,
if
it
were
necessary
;
yea
,
and
they
were
also
taught
never
to
give
an
ollence
;
yee
,
and
never
to
raise
the
sword
,
except
it
were
againat
an
enemy
,
except
it
were
to
preserve
their
lives
:
and
this
was
their
faith
,
that
by
so
doing
,
God
would
prosper
them
in
the
Jand
;
or
in
other
words
,
if
they
were
faithful
in
keeping
the
command
ments
of
God
,
that
he
would
prosper
them
in
the
land
;
yea
,
warn
them
to
flee
,
or
to
prepare
for
war
,
according
to
their
danger
;
and
also
,
that
God
would
make
it
known
unto
them
,
whither
they
should
go
to
defend
themselves
against
their
enemies
;
and
by
so
doing
,
the
Lord
would
deliver
them
:
and
this
was
the
faith
of
Moroni
;
and
his
heart
did
glory
in
it
;
not
in
the
shedding
of
blood
,
but
in
doing
good
,
in
preserving
his
people
;
yea
,
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
God
;
yea
,
and
:
resisting
iniquity
.
Yea
,
verily
,
verily
I
say
unto
you
,
[fall
men
[File:363]
had
been
,
and
were
,
and
ever
would
be
,
like
unto
Moroni
,
be
hold
,
the
very
powers
of
hell
would
have
been
shaken
forever
;
yea
,
the
Devil
would
never
have
no
power
over
the
hearts
of
jhe
children
of
men
.
Behold
,
he
was
aman
like
unto
Ammon
,
the
son
of
Mosiah
,
yea
,
and
even
the
other
sons
of
Mosiah
;
yea
,
and
also
Alma
and
his
sons
:
for
they
were
all
men
of
God
.
Now
bebold
,
Helaman
and
his
brethren
were
no
less
serviceable
unto
the
people
,
than
was
Moroni
;
for
they
did
preach
the
word
of
God
,
and
they
did
baptize
unto
repentance
,
a}}
men
whosoever
would
hearken
unto
their
words
.
And
thus
they
went
forth
,
and
the
people
did
humble
themselves
because
of
their
words
,
insomuch
that
they
were
highly
favored
of
the
Lord
;
and
thus
they
were
free
from
wars
and
confentions
among
themselves
;
yea
,
even
for
the
space
of
four
years
.
Butas
Ihave
said
in
the
latter
end
of
the
nineteenth
;
yea
,
notwillstanding
their
peace
amongst
themselves
,
they
were
compelled
reluctantly
to
contend
with
their
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
;
yea
,
and
im
fine
,
their
wars
neyer
did
cease
for
the
space
of
many
years
with
the
Lamanites
,
notwithstanding
their
much
reluctance
.
Now
they
were
sorry
to
take
up
arms
against
the
Lamanites
,
because
they
did
not
delight
in
the
shedding
of
blood
;
yea
,
and
this
was
not
all
;
they
were
sorry
to
be
the
means
of
sending
so
many
of
their
brethren
out
of
this
world
into
an
eternal
world
,
unprepared
to
meet
their
Goad
;
nevertheless
,
they
could
not
suffer
to
lay
down
their
lives
,
that
—
their
wives
and
their
children
should
be
massacred
by
the
barbarous
cruelty
of
those
who
was
once
their
brethren
,
yea
,
and
had
dissented
from
their
church
,
and
had
left
them
,
and
had
gone
to
destroy
them
,
by
joining
the
Lamanites
;
yea
,
they
could
not
bear
that
their
brethren
should
rejoice
over
the
blood
of
the
Nephites
,
so
long
as
there
were
any
who
should
keep
the
commandments
of
God
:
for
the
promise
of
the
Lord
were
,
If
they
should
keep
his
commandments
,
they
should
prosper
in
the
land
.
;
_
And
now
it
came
to
pass
,
in
the
eleventhmonth
of
the
nineteenth
year
,
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
,
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
were
seen
approaching
towards
the
land
of
Ammonihah
.
And
behold
,
the
city
had
been
re
-
built
,
and
Moroni
had
stationed
an
army
by
the
borders
of
the
city
,
and
they
had
cast
up
dirt
round
about
,
to
shield
them
from
the
arrows
and
the
stones
of
the
Lamanites
;
for
behold
,
they
fought
with
stones
,
and
with
arrows
.
Behold
,
I
said
that
the
city
of
Ammonihah
had
-
been
re
-
built
,
.
I
say
unto
you
,
yea
,
that
it
[File:364]
es
et
ae
was
in
part
re
-
built
,
and
because
the
Lamanites
had
destroyei
)
3t
once
because
of
the
iniguity
of
the
people
,
they
supposed
that
it
would
again
become
an
ersy
prey
for
then
.
But
he
:
hold
,
how
.
great
was
their
disappomtment
;
for
behold
,
the
Nephites
had
dug
up
aridge
of
earth
round
about
them
,
which
was
so
high
that
the
Lamanites
could
not
cast
ther
stones
and
their
arrows
at
them
,
that
they
might
take
effect
:
neither
could
they
come
upon
them
,
save
it
was
by
their
place
of
entrance
.
Now
at
this'time
,
the
Chief
Captains
of
the
La
.
manites
were
astonished
excecdingly
,
because
of
the
wisdom
ofthe
Nephites
in
preparing
their
places
of
security
.
Now
the
leaders
of
the
Lamanites
had
supposed
,
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
numbers
;
yea
,
they
supposed
that
they
should
be
privileged
to
come
upon
them
as
they
had
hitherio
done
;
yea
,
end
they
had
also
prepared
themselves
with
shields
,
aud
with
breast
-
plates
;
and
they
had
also
prepared
themselves
with
garments
of
skins
;
yea
,
very
thick
garments
,
to
cover
their
nakedness
,
And
being
thus
prepared
,
they
supposed
that
they
should
casily
overpower
and
subject
their
brethren
to
the
yoke
of
bondage
,
or
slay
and
massacre
them
according
to
their
pleasure
.
But
behold
,
to
their
uttermost
astonish
.
ment
,
they
were
prepared
for
them
,
in
a
manner
which
never
had
been
known
among
all
the
children
of
Lehi
.
Now
they
were
prepared
for
the
Lamanites
,
to
battle
,
after
the
manner
of
the
instructions
of
Moroni
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
,
or
the
Amalickiahites
,
were
exccedingly
astonished
at
their
manner
of
preparation
for
war
.
Now
if
king
Amalickiah
had
come
down
out
of
the
land
of
Nephi
,
at
the
head
of
his
army
,
perhaps
he
would
have
caused
the
Lamanites
to
have
attacked
the
Nephites
at
the
city
of
Ammonihah
;
for
behold
,
be
did
care
not
for
the
blood
of
his
people
.
But
behold
,
Amalickiah
did
not
come
down
himself
,
to
battle
.
And
behold
,
his
Chief
Captains
durst
not
attack
the
Nephites
at
the
city
of
Ammonibah
,
for
Moroni
had
altered
the
management
of
affairs
among
the
Nephites
,
insomuch
that
the
Lamanites
were
disappointed
in
their
places
of
retreat
,
and
they
could
not
come
upon
them
;
therefore
they
retreated
into
the
wilderness
,
and
took
their
camp
,
and
marched
towards
the
land
of
Noah
,
supposing
that
to
be
the
next
best
place
for
them
to
come
against
the
Nophites
;
for
they
knew
not
that
Moroni
had
fortified
or
had
built
forts
of
security
for
every
city
in
all
the
land
round
about
;
therefore
they
marched
forward
to
the
land
of
Noah
,
witha
firm
.
determination
;
yea
,
their
Chief
Captains
ST
[File:365]
cane
forward
,
and
took
an
oath
that
they
would
destroy
the
ople
of
that
city
.
But
behold
,
to
their
astonishment
,
the
city
a
Noah
,
which
had
hitherio
been
a
weak
place
,
had
now
,
by
te
means
of
Moroni
,
become
strong
;
yea
,
even
to
excced
the
grength
of
the
city
Ammonihah
.
And
now
behold
,
this
was
yisdom
in
Moroni
;
for
he
had
supposed
that
they
would
he
fightened
at
the
city
Ammonihah
;
and
as
the
city
of
Noah
tad
hitherto
been
the
weakest
part
of
the
land
,
therefore
they
would
march
thither
to
battle
;
and
thus
it
was
,
according
to
tisdesires
.
And
behold
,
Moroni
had
appointed
Lehi
to
be
Chief
Captain
over
the
men
of
that
city
;
and
it
was
that
same
(
chi
which
fought
with
the
Lamanites
in
the
valley
,
on
the
ast
of
the
river
Sidon
.
And
new
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
,
that
when
the
Lamanites
tatfound
that
Lehi
commanded
the
city
,
they
were
again
iisappointed
,
for
they
feared
Lehi
exceedingly
;
nevertheless
,
tieir
Chief
Captains
had
sworn
with
un
oath
,
to
attack
the
tiy
;
therefore
they
brought
up
their
armies
.
Now
behold
,
be
Lamanites
could
not
get
into
their
forts
of
security
,
by
any
lier
way
save
hy
the
entrance
,
because
of
the
highness
of
lie
bank
which
had
been
thrown
up
,
and
the
depth
of
the
ich
which
had
been
dug
round
about
,
save
it
were
by
th
airance
,
And
thus
were
the
Nephites
prepared
to
destroy
all
whas
should
attempt
to
climb
up
to
enter
the
fort
,
by
any
ier
Way
,
by
casting
over
stones
and
arrows
at
them
,
Thus
bey
were
prepared
;
yea
,
a
body
of
their
most
strong
men
,
vid
their
swords
and
their
slings
,
to
smite
down
all
who
ould
attempt
to
come
into
their
place
of
security
,
by
the
we
of
entrance
;
and_
thus
were
they
prepared
to
defend
lenselves
against
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pasa
that
te
Captains
of
the
Lamanites
brought
up
their
armies
before
teplace
of
entrance
,
and
began
to
contend
with
the
Nephites
,
gt
mto
their
place
of
security
;
but
behold
,
they
were
drihack
from
time
to
time
,
insomuch
:
that
they
were
slain
,
lh
an
immense
slaughter
.
Now
when
they
found
that
they
ould
not
obtain
power
over
the
Nephites
by
the
pass
,
they
to
dig
down
their
banks
of
earth
,
that
they
might
obtain
iiss
to
their
armies
,
that
they
might
have
an
equal
chance
ight
;
but
behold
,
im
these
attempts
,
they
were
swept
off
te
stones
and
the
arrows
which
were
thrown
at
them
;
tstead
of
filling
up
their
ditches
by
pulling
down
the
tks
-
of
carth
,
they
were
filled
up
in
a
measure
,
with
their
and
wounded
bodies
.
Thus
the
Nephites
had
all
pow
[File:366]
er
over
their
enemies
;
and
thus
the
Lamanites
did
attenpt
,,
destroy
the
Nephites
,
until
their
Chicl
Captains
were
y
slain
;
yea
,
and
more
than
a
thousand
of
the
Lamanites
wm
slain
;
while
on
the
other
hand
,
there
was
not
a
single
soulg
the
Nephites
which
wereslain
,
There
were
about
fifty
why
were
wounded
,
which
had
been
exposed
to
the
arrows
of
Lamanites
through
the
pass
;
but
they
were
shielded
by
th
shields
,
and
their
breast
-
plates
,
and
their
head
-
plates
,
insomy
that
their
wounds
were
upon
their
legs
;
many
of
which
we
very
severe
.
And
it
came
to
pass
,
that
when
the
Lamanites
saw
their
Chief
Gaptains
were
al}
slain
,
they
fled
into
the
wille
ness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
returned
to
the
lanty
Nephi
,
to
inform
their
King
,
Amalickiah
,
who
was
a
Nepht
by
birth
,
concerning
their
great
loss
.
And
it
came
tope
that
he
was
exceeding
angry
with
his
people
,
because
hehi
not
obtained
his
desire
over
the
Nephites
;
he
had
not
subj
.
ted
them
to
the
yoke
of
bondage
;
yea
,
he
was
excetly
wroth
,
and
he
did
curse
God
,
and
also
Moroni
,
and
sien
with
an
oath
that
he
would
drink
his
blood
;
and
this
bec
Moroni
had
kept
the
commandments
of
God
in
prepating
f
the
safety
of
bis
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
,
that
onlk
other
hand
,

now
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
did
not
stop
ahi
preparations
{or
wer
,
or
to
defend
themselves
against
tbe
manites
;
for
he
caused
that
hie
armies
should
comment
the
commencement
of
the
twentieth
year
of
the
reign
dl®

,
that
they
should
commence
in

anh
round
about
all
the
cities
,
throughout
-
all
the
Jand
which
was
possessed
by
the
Nephites
:
and
upon
the
top
of
these
jidges
of
earth
,
he
caused
that
there
should
be
timbers
;
yea
,
works
of
timbers
built
up
to
the
height
ofa
man
,
round
about
tie
cities
.
And
he
caused
that
upon
those
works
of
timbers
,
jlat
there
should
be
a
frame
of
pickets
built
upon
the
lumbers
,
mand
about
;
and
they
were
strong
and
high
;
and
he
caused
avers
to
be
erected
that
overlooked
those
works
of
pickets
;
adhe
caused
places
of
security
to
be
built
upon
those
towers
,
jilat
the
stones
and
the
arrows
of
the
Laimanites
could
not
rt
therm
.
And
they
were
prepared
,
that
they
could
cast
wones
from
the
top
thereof
,
according
to
their
pleasure
and
er
strength
,
and
slay
him
which
should
attempt
to
approach
war
the
walls
of
the
city
.
Thus
Moroni
did
prepare
strong
idds
against
the
coming
of
their
enemies
,
round
about
every
tity
im
all
the
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
caused
that
his
armies
pe
go
forth
into
the
east
wilderness
;
yea
,
and
they
went
,
and
drove
all
the
Lamanites
which
were
inthe
east
wilfauess
into
their
own
lands
,
which
were
south
of
the
land
of
lazhemla
;
and
the
land
of
Nephi
did
run
ina
straight
course
futhe
East
Sea
to
the
West
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
fien
Moroni
had
driven
all
the
Lamanites
out
of
the
east
fiderness
,
which
was
north
of
the
lands
of
their
own
possions
,
he
caused
that
the
inhabitants
which
were
in
the
tidof
Zaraherla
,
and
in
the
Jand
round
about
,
should
go
tik
into

ss
,
even
to

borders

by

scatoe
,
and
possess
the
land
.
And
he
also
placed
armies
on
lesouth
,
in
the
borders
of
their
possessions
,
and
caused
io
erect
fortifications
,
that
they
might
secure

the

yea
,
and
also
on

fortifying
the
line
een
the
Nephites
and
the
Lamanites
,
between
the
land
of

and

land
of

from

,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
began
the
foundajiy
ofa
city
;
and
they
called
the
name
of
the
city
Moroni
;
it
was
by
the

and
it
was

for

of

of

and

called
the
name
of
the
city
,

the
land
,
Nephihah
.
And

north
;
one
ina
particular
manner
,
which
they
called
Ja
)
which
was
in
the
north
,
by
the
borders
of
the
seashore
,
jy
thus
ended
the
twentieth
year
.
And
in
these
prospeng
circumstances
were
the
people

of

exceedingly
,
ad
they
became
exceeding
rich
;
yea
,
and
they
did

in

And
thus
we
see
how
mereilil
al
just
are
all
the
dealings
of
the
Lord
,
to
the
fulfilling
of
alis
words
unto
the
cbildren

,
we
can

even

much
as

both

For
behold

the

did
claim

And
if

when

,
which
was

there

dthe

desired

points

should

But
behold
,
Pahoran
would
not
alter
,
wrsuffer
the
law
to
be
altered
;
therefore
he
did
not
hearken
those
who
had
sent
in
their
voices
with
their
petitions
,
conwming
the
altering
of
the

therefore
those
which
were
desirous
that

should
be
altered
,
were
angry
with
bin
,
ai
desired
that
he
should
no

Chief
Judge
over

;
therefore
there
arose
a
warm
dispute
concerning
the
matier
;

not
unto
bloodshed
.
And
it
came
to
pass
ihat
those
who
were
desirous
that
Pahomehould
be
dethroned
from

,
were
called

a
manner
to

to

And
those
who
were
desirous
tat
Pahoran
should
remain
Chief
Judge
over

,
took
yon
them
the
name
of
freemen
;
and
thus
was
the
division
aiong
them
:
forthe
freemen
had
swora
or
covenanted
to
aaintain
their
rights
,
and
the
privileges
of
their
religion
,
by
a
fee
government
,
and
(
came
to

that
this
matter
of
their
contention
was
willed
,
by
the
voice
of
the
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
levoice
of
the
people
came
in
the
favor
of
the
freemen
,

retained

many
of

of

men
to
silence

not

were

Now
those
which
were
in
favor
of
kings
,
were
tose
of
high
birth
;
and
they
sought
to
be
kings
;
and
they
fe
supported
by
those
which
sought

and

mrthe

But

was
a
critical
time
for
such
tlentions
to

Amalickiab
had
gathered
together
a

derful
great
army
,
insomuch
that
he
feared
not
to

of

,
Yea
,
even
Amalickiah
did
himgy
come
down
,
at
the
lead
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
was
ing
twenty
and
fifth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
;
and
it
my
at
the
same
time
that
they
had
began
to
scttle
the
aflainsy
their
contentions
concerning
the
Chief
Judge
,
Pahoran
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
men
which
were
calli
king
-
meu
,
had
heard
that
the
Lamanites
were
coming
downs
battle
against
them
,
they
were
glad
in
their
hearts
,
and
thy
refused
to
take
up
arms
;
for
they
were
so
wroth
with
&
Chief
Judge
,
and
also
with
the
people
of
liberty
,
that
th
would
not
take
up

to
defend

country
.
And
item
to
pass
that
when
Moroni
saw
this
,
and
also
saw
that
thel
manites
were
coming
into
the
borders
of
the
Jand

he
wasececding
wroth
,
because
of
the
stubbornness
of
those
pomp

of
whom
he
had
Jabored
with
so
much

;
yea
,
he
was
exceeding
wroth
;
his
soul
was
filled
with
ay

agaist
them
,
And
it
came
(
o
pass
that
he
sent
a
pete
with
the
voice
of
the
people
,
unto
the
Governor
af

jai
desiring
that

should

for
it
was

to
put

and

among

it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
granted
,
according

yoiee
of

people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
commanded
that
his
am
should
go
against

,
to
pull
down

And
ito
to

that
the
armies
did
march
forth
against
them
;
andihy
did
pull
down

insomuch

they
were

it
came
to

that
there
were
four

of

were

down
by

;
and
those

,
for
there
was
no
time
for

at

period
the
remainder
of

,
rather
than
to
be
smote
to
the
earth
by

,
yieided
to
the
standard
of
het
and
were
compelled
to

in
their
cities
,
and
to
take
up

afl
t
[File:373]
country
.
And
thus
Moroni
put
an
end
to
those
king
-
men
,
that
there
were
not
any
known
by
the
:
appellation
of
king
-
men
;
and
thus
he
put
an
end
to
the
stubbornness
,
and
the
pride
of
those
people
Which
professed
the
blood
of
nobility
;
but
they
were
brought
down
to
humble
themselves
like
unto
their
brethreo
,
and
to
fight
valiantly
for
their
frecdom
from
bondage
.
Behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
while
Moroni
was
thus
breaking
down
the
wars
and
contentions
among
his
own
people
,
and
subjecting
them
to
peace
and
civilization
,
and
making
regulaions
to
prepare
for
war
against
the
Lamanites
,
behold
,
the
Lamanites
had
come
into
the
land
of
Moroni
,
which
was
in
the
borders
by
the
seashore
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
were
not
sufliciently
strong
in
the
city
of
Moroni
;
therefore
Amalickiah
did
drive
them
,
slaying
many
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
fook
possession
of
the
city
;
yea
,
possession
of
all
their
fortificitions
.
And
those
which
fled
out
of
the
city
of
Moroni
,
came
to
the
city
of
Nephihah
;
and
also
the
people
of
the
city
of
Lehi
gathered
themsclves
together
,
and
made
preparations
,
aid
were
ready
to
receive
the
Lamanites
to
battle
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
would
not
suffer
the
Lamanites
to
go
against
the
city
of
Nephihah
to
battle
,
but
kept
them
down
by
the
seashore
,
leaving
men
in
every
city
tomaintain
and
defend
it
;
and
thus
he
went
on
,
taking
posxssion
of
many
cities
:
the
cily
of
Nephihah
,
and
the
city
of
Lehi
,
and
the
city
of
Morianton
,
and
the
city
of
Omner
,
and
the
city
of
Gid
,
and
the
city
of
Mulek
,
all
of
which
were
on
the
east
horders
,
by
the
seashore
.
And
thus
had
the
Lamanites
obtained
,
by
the
cunning
of
Amalickiah
,
so
many
citics
,
by
their
numberless
hosts
,
all
of
which
were
strongly
fortified
,
after
tte
manner
of
the
fortifications
of
Moroni
;
all
of
which
afforded
strongholds
for
the
Lamanites
.
:
And
if
came
to
pass
that
they
marched
to
the
borders
of
the
lind
Bountiful
,
driving
the
Nephites
before
them
,
and
slaying
many
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
met
.
by
Teancum
,
who
had
slain
Morianton
,
and
had
headed
his
people
in
his
fight
,
And
itcame
to
pass
that
he
headed
Amalickiah
also
,
4
he
was
marching
forth
with
his
numerous
army
,
that
he
Iight
take
possession
of
the
land
Bountiful
,
and
also
the
land
Rorthward
.
But
behold
,
he
met
with
a
disappointment
,
by
being
repulsed
by
Teancum
and
his
men
,
for
they
were
great
Warriors
;
for
every
man
of
Teancum
did
exceed
the
Laman
[File:374]
ites
in
their
strength
,
and
in
their
skill
of
war
,
insomuch
ihe
they
did
gain
advantage
over
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
1o
pass
that
they
did
harrass
them
,
insomud
,
that
they
did
slay
them
even
until
itwas
dark
.
And
it
cane
to
pass
that
Teancum
and
bis
men
did
pitch
their
tents
in
he
horders
of
the
land
Bountiful
;
and
Amalickiah
did
pitch
his
tents
in
the
borders
on
the
beach
hy
the
seashore
:
and
afig
this
inanner
were
they
driven
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
night
had
come
,
Tem
cun
and
his
servant
stole
forth
and
went
out

night
,
anj

powered
them
,
because
of
their
nich
fatigue
,
which
was
cay
sed
by
the
labors
and
heat
of
the
day
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Teancum
stole
privily
into
the
tent
of
the
king
,
and
put
a
javelin
to
his
heart
;
and
he
di
cause
the
death
of
the
kingimmediately
,
that
he
did
not
awake
his
servants
.
And
he
returned
again
priyily
to
his
own
camp
,
and
behold
,
his
men
were
asleep
;
and
he
awoke
them
,
ani
told
them
all
the
things
that
he
had
done
.
And
he
caused
that
his
armies
should
stand
in
readiness
,
lest
the
Tamanites
hal
awoke
,
and
should
come
upon
them
.
And
thus
ended
ile
twenty
and
filth
year
of
the
reign
of

Judges
over

people
of
Nephi
?
and
thus
ended
the
days
of

CHAPTER
XXIV
.
<ANp
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
behold
,
wher
the
Lamanites
awoke
on
the
first
morning
of
the
first
mont
.
behold
,
they
found
Amalickiah
was
dead
,
in
bis
own
tent
;
aul
they
also
saw
that
Teancum
was
ready
to
give
them
battle
o
thatday
.
And
now
when
the
Lamanites
saw
this
,
they
wert
aflmghted
;
and
they
abandoned
their
design
in
marching
inte
the
Jand
northward
,
and
retreated
with
all
their
army
into
tht
city
of
Mulek
,
and
sought
protection
in
their
fortifications
—
And
it
came
.
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
Amalickiah
was
a
pointed
king
over
the
people
;
and
bis
name
was
Ammoron
:
thus
king
Ammoron
,
the
brother
of
king
Amalickiah
,
was
a
pointed
to
reign
in
his
stead
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
command
that
his
peoplt
[File:375]
should
maintain
those
cities
which
they
had
takew
by
the
shedding
of
blood
;
for
they
had
not
taken
any
cities
,
save
they
had
lost
much
blood
.
And
now
Teancum
saw
that
the
Lamanites
were
determined
to
maintain
those
cities
which
they
had
taken
,
and
those
parts
of
the
land
which
they
had
obtained
possession
of
;
and
also
sceing
the
enormity
of
their
number
,
Teancum
thought
it
was
not
expedient
that
he
should
attempt
to
attack
them
in
their
forts
;
but
he
kept
his
men
round
about
,
as
if
making
preparations
for
war
;
yea
,
and
truly
he
was
preparing
to
defend
himself
against
them
,
by
casting
up
walls
round
about
,
and
preparing
places
of
resort
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
kept
thus
preparing
for
war
,
until
Moroni
had
sent
a
large
number
of
men
to
strengthen
his
amy
;
and
Moroni
also
sent
orders
unto
him
,
that
he
should
retain
all
the
prisoners
which
fell
into
his
hands
;
for
as
the
Lamauites
had
taken
many
prisoners
,
that
he
should
retain
all
the
prisoners
of
the
Lamanites
,
as
a
ransom
for
those
which
the
Lamanites
had
taken
.
And_he
also
sent
orders
unto
him
,
.
that
he
should
fortify
the
land
Bountiful
,
and
secure
the
nurrow
pass
which
led
into
the
land
northward
,
lest
the
Lamanites
should
obtain
that
point
,
and
should
have
power
to
harrass
them
on
every
side
.
And
Moroni
also
sent
unto
him
,
desiring
him
that
he
would
be
faithful
in
maintaining
that
quarter
of
the
land
,
and
that
he
would
seek
every
opportunity
to
scourge
the
Lamanites
in
that
quarter
,
as
much
as
was
in
his
power
,
that
perhaps
he
might
take
again
,
by
stratagem
or
some
other
way
,
those
cities
which
had
been
taken
out
of
their
hands
;
and
that
he
also
would
fortify
and
strengthen
the
cities
round
about
,
which
had
not
fallen
mto
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
And
he
also
said
unto
him
,
Twould
come
untoyou
,
but
behold
,
the
Lamanites
are
upon
us
in
the
borders
of
the
land
by
the
West
Sca
;
and
block
I
go
against
them
,
therefore
I
cannot
come
unto
you
.
Now
the
king
(
Ammoron
,)
had
departed
out
of
the
land
of
Zsxahomla
,
and
had
made
known
unto
the
queen
concerning
the
death
of
his
brother
,
and
had
gathered
together
a
large
tumber
of
men
,
and
had
marched
forth
against
the
Nephites
,
on
the
borders
by
the
West
Sea
;
and
thus
he
was
endeavoring
toharrass
the
Nephites
,
and
to
draw
away
a
part
of
their
forets
to
that
part
of
the
land
,
while
he
had
commanded
those
which
he
had
left
to
possess
the
cities
which
he
had
taken
,
that
they
should
also
harrass
the
Nepbites
on
the
borders
by
the
East
Sea
;
and
should
take
possession
of
their
lands
as
[File:376]
much
as
it
were
in
their
power
,
according
to
the
power
of
their
armies
.
And
thus
were
the
Nephites
in
those
dangeroig
circumstances
,
in
the
ending
of
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
But
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twenty
and
seventh
yeu
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
,
that
Teancum
,
by
the
command
of
Moroni
,
who
had
established
armies
to
protect
the
south
and
the
west
borders
of
the
land
,
had
began
his
march
towards
the
land
Bountiful
,
that
he
might
assist
Teancum
with
hig
men
,
in
retaking
the
cities
which
they
had
lost
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Teancum
had
received
orders
to
make
un
attack
upon
the
city
of
Mulek
,
and
retake
it
if
it
were
possible
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Teancum
made
preparations
to
make
an
attack
upon
the
city
of
Mulek
,
and
march
forth
with
his
army
against
the
Lamanites
;
but
he
saw
that
it
was
im
possible
that
he
could
overpower
them
while
they
were
ia
their
fortifications
;
therefore
he
abandoned
his
designs
,
ani
returned
again
to'the
city
Bountiful
,
to
wait
for
the
coming
of
Moroni
,
that
he
might
receive
strength
to
his
army
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
did
arrive
with
his
army
to
the
land
of
Bountiful
,
in
the
latter
end
of
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
eighth
year
,
Moroni
and
Teancum
,
and
many
of
the
Chief
Captains
,
held
a
council
of
war
,
what
they
should
do
to
cause
the
Le
manites
to
come
out
against
them
to
battle
;
or
that
they
might
by
some
means
,
flatter
them
out
of
their
strong
holds
,
that
they
might
gain
advantage
over
them
,
and
take
again
the
city
of
Mulek
.
Aad
it
came
to
pass
that
they
sent
embassies
to
the
army
dl
the
Lamanites
,
which
protected
the
city
of
Mulek
,
to
their
leader
,
whose
name
was
Jacob
,
desiring
Lim
that
he
would
come
out
with
his
armies
to
meet
them
upon
the
plains
,
be
tween
the
two
cities
.
But
behold
,
Jacob
,
which
was
a
Ztramite
,
would
not
come
out
with
his
army
to
mect
them
upon
the
plains
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
,
having
no
hopes
of
meel
-
)
ing
them
upon
fair
grounds
,
therefore
he
resolved
upon
a
plat
that
he
might
decoy
the
Lamanites
out
of
their
strong
holds
Therefore
he
caused
that
Teancum
should
take
a
small
number
of
men
,
and
march
down
near
the
seashore
;
and
Moroni
ani
his
army
,
by
night
,
marched
into
the
wilderness
,
on
the
west
of
the
city
Mulek
;
and
thus
,
on
the
morrow
,
when
the
guards
[File:377]
of
the
Lamanites
had
discovered
Teancum
,
they
ran
and
told
jt
unto
Jacob
,
their
leader
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
did
march
forth
against
Teancum
,
supposing
by
their
numbers
to
overpower
Teancum
,
because
of
the
smailness
of
his
numbers
.
And
as
Teancum
saw
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
coming
out
against
him
,
he
began
to
retreat
down
by
the
seashore
,
northward
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lamanites
saw
that
he
began
to
flee
,
they
took
courage
and
pursued
them
with
vigor
.
And
while
Teancum
was
thus
leading
away
the
Lamanites
which
were
pursuing
them
in
vain
,
behold
,
Moroni
commanded
that
a
part
of
his
army
which
were
with
him
,
should
march
forth
into
the
city
,
and
take
possession
of
it
.
And
thus
they
did
,
and
slew
all
those
who
had
been
left
to
protect
the
city
;
yea
,
all
those
who
would
not
yield
up
their
weapons
of
war
.
And
thus
Moroni
had
obtained
a
possession
of
the
city
Mulek
,
with
a
part
of
his
army
,
while
he
marched
with
the
remainder
to
mect
the
Lamanites
,
when
they
should
return
from
the
pursuit
of
Teancum
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
pursue
Teancum
until
they
came
near
the
city
Bountiful
,
and
then
they
were
met
©
by
Lehi
,
and
a
small
army
,
which
had
been
left
to
protect
the
city
Bountiful
.
And
now
behold
,
when
the
Chief
Captains
of
:
the
Lamanites
had
beheld
Lebi
,
with
his
army
,
coming
against
them
,
they
fled
in
much
confusion
,
lest
perhaps
they
should
not
obtain
the
city
Mulek
,
before
Lehi
should
overtake
them
;
for
they
were
wearied
because
of
their
march
;
and
the
men
of
Lebi
were
fresh
,
Now
the
Lamanites
did
not
know
that
Moroni
had
been
in
their
rear
with
his
army
;
and
all
they
feared
,
was
Lehi
and
his
men
.
Now
Lehi
was
not
desirous
toovertake
them
,
till
they
should
meet
Moroni
and
his
army
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
before
the
Lamanites
had
retreated
far
,
they
were
surrounded
by
the
Nephites
;
by
the
men
of
Moroni
on
one
hand
,
and
the
men
of
Lehi
on
the
other
,
all
of
whom
were
fresh
and
full
of
strength
;
but
the
Lamanites
were
wearied
,
because
of
theirlong
march
.
And
Moroni
commanded
his
men
that
they
should
fall
upon
them
,
until
they
had
given
up
their
weapons
of
war
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Jacob
,
being
their
leader
,
being
also
a
Zoramite
,
and
having
an
unconquerable
spirit
,
he
led
the
Lamanites
forth
to
battle
,
with
exceeding
fury
against
Mo
~
toni
.
Moroni
being
in
their
course
ef
march
,
therefore
Jacob
[File:378]
was
determined
to
slay
them
,
and
cut
his
way
through
tothe
city
of
Mulek
.
But
behold
,
Moroni
and
his
men
were
more
powerful
;
therefore
they
did
not
give
way
before
the
La
manites
,
And
it
came
to
pass
ihat
they
fought
on
both
hands
with
exceeding
fury
;
and
there
were
many
slain
on
both
sides
;
yea
,
and
Moroni
was
wounded
,
and
Jacob
was
killed
.
Ang
Lehi
pressed
upon
their
rear
with
such
fury
,
with
his
strone
men
,
that
the
Lamanites
in
the
rear
delivered
up
their
weap
.
ons
of
war
;
and
the
remainder
of
them
,
being
much
confused
,
knew
not
whether
te
go
oy
to
strike
.
Now
Moroni
seeing
their
confusion
,
he
said
unto
thera
,
Hf
ye
will
bring
forth
your
weapons
of
war
,
and
deliver
thein
-
up
,
behold
we
will
forbear
shedding
your
blood
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
La
manites
had
heard
these
words
,
their
Chief
Captains
,
all
those
which
were
not
slain
,
came
forth
and
threw
down
their
weapons
of
war
at
the
fect
of
Moroni
,
and
also
commanded
their
men
that
they
should
do
the
same
;
but
behold
,
there
were
many
that
would
not
;
and
those
who
would
not
deliver
up
their
swords
,
were
taken
and
bound
,
and
their
weapons
of
war
were
taken
from
them
,
and
they
were
compelled
to
march
©
with
their
brethren
forth
jnto
the
land
Bountiful
.
And
now
~
the
number
of
prisoners
which
were
taken
,
exceeded
more
than
the
number
of
those
which
had
been
slain
;
yen
,
more
than
those
which
had
been
slain
on
both
sides
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
set
euards
over
the
prt
_
soners
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
did
compel
them
:
to
go
{orth
and
bury
their
dead
;
yea
,
and
also
the
dead
ofthe
Nephites
which
were
slain
;
and
Moroni
.
placed
men
over
them
to
guard
them
while
they
should
perform
their
labors
,
And
Moroni
went
10
the
city
of
Mulek
with
Lehi
,
and
tool
command
of
the
city
,
and
gaye
it
unto
Lehi
.
Now
behold
this
Lehi
was
a
man
who
had
been
with
Moroni
in
the
more
part
of
all
lis
battles
;
and
he
was
aman
like
unto
Moroni
;
and
they
rejoiced
in
each
other's
safety
;
yea
,
they
were
beloved
by
each
other
,
and
also
beloved
by
all
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
it
came
to
to
pass
that
after
the
Lamanites
had
finished
burying
their
dead
,
and
also
the
dead
of
the
Nephites
,
they
were
marched
back
into
the
land
Bountiful
;
and
Teancum
,
by
the
orders
of
Moroni
,
caused
that
they
should
commence
in
laboring
in
digging
a
ditch
round
about
the
Jand
,
or
the
ity
Bountiful
;
and
he
caused
that
they
should
build
a
breasiwork
of
timbers
upon
the
inner
bank
of
the
ditch
;
and
they
castup
[File:379]
dirt
out
of
the
ditch
against
the
breastwork
of
.
timbers
;
and
thus
they
did
cause
the
Lamanites
to
labor
,
unti
!
they
had
encircled
the
city
of
Bountiful
round
about
with
a
strong
wall
of
timbers
and
earth
,
toan
exceeding
height
.
And
this
city
begame
an
cxeceding
strong
hold
ever
after
;
and
in
this
city
they
did
guard
the
prisoners
of
the
Lamanites
;
yea
,
even
withjna
wall
,
which
they
had
caused
them
to
build
with
their
own
hands
.
Now
Moroni
was
compelled
to
cause
the
Lamanites
iolabor
,
because
it
were
casy
to
guard
them
while
at
their
labor
;
and
he
desired
all
his
forces
,
when
he
should
make
an
attack
upon
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
had
thus
gained
a
victory
over
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
armics
of
te
Lamanites
,
and
had
obtained
possession
of
the
city
Mulek
,
which
svas
one
of
the
strongest
holds
of
the
Lamanites
in
the
land
of
Nephi
;
and
thus
he
had
also
built
a
strong
hold
to
retain
his
prisoners
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
no
more
attempt
a
hattle
with
the
Lamanites
in
that
year
,
but
he
did
employ
his
men
in
preparing
for
war
;
yea
,
andin
making
fortifications
to
guard
against
the
Lamanites
;
yea
,
and
also
delivering
their
women
and
their
children
from
famine
and
affliction
,
and
providing
.
food
for
their
armies
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
,
onthe
West
Sea
,
south
,
while
in
the
absence
of
Moroni
,
on
account
of
some
intrigue
amongst
the
Nephites
,
which
caused
dissensions
amongst
them
,
had
gained
some
ground
over
the
Nephites
,
yea
,
msomuch
that
they
had
obtained
possession
of
anumber
of
their
cities
in
that
part
of
the
land
;
and
thus
beeanse
of
iniquity
amongst
themselves
,
yea
,
because
of
dissensions
.
and
intrigue
among
themselves
,
they
were
placed
in
the
most
dangerous
.
circumstances
.
And
now
behold
,
I
have
somewhat
to
say
concerning
the
people
of
Ammon
,
which
,
in
the
beginning
,
were
Lamanites
;
but
-
by
Ammon
and
his
brethren
,
or
rather
by
the
power
and
word
of
God
,
they
had
been
converted
unto
the
Lord
;
and
they
had
been
brought
down
into
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
had
ever
since
been
protected
by
the
Nephites
;
and
because
oftheir
oath
,
they
had
been
kept
from
taking
up
arms
against
their
brethren
:
for
they
had
taken
an
oath
,
that
they
never
would
shed
blood
more
;
and
according
to
their
oath
,
they
Would
have
perished
;
yea
,
they
would
have
suffered
themselves
fo
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
their
brethren
,
had
it
[File:380]
not
been
for
the
pity
and
the
exceeding
love
which
Ammon
and
his
brethren
had
had
for
them
;
and
for
this
cause
,
they
were
brought
down
into
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
and
they
ever
had
been
protected
by
the
Nephites
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
saw
the
danger
,
and
the
many
afflictions
and
tribulations
which
the
Nephites
bore
{oy
them
,
they
were
moved
with
compassion
,
and
were
desirays
to
take
up
arms
in
the
defence
of
their
country
.
But
behold
,
as
they
were
about
to
take
their
weapons
of
war
,
they
were
overpowered
by
the
persuasions
of
Helaman
and
his
brethren
,
for
they
were
about
to
break
the
oath
which
they
had
made
;
and
Helaman
feared
lest
by
so
doing
,
they
should
lose
their
souls
;
therefore
all
those
which
had
entered
.
into
this
core
nant
,
were
compelled
to
behold
their
brethren
wade
through
their
afflictions
,
in
their
dangerous
circumstances
,
at
this
time
,
Dut
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
they
had
many
sons
,
which
had
not
entered
into
a
covenant
that
they
would
not
take
their
weapons
of
war
to
defend
themselves
against
their
enemies
;
therefore
they
did
assemble
themselves
together
at
this
time
,
as
many
as
were
able
to
take
up
arms
;
and
they
called
them
.
selves
Nephites
;
and
they
entered
into
a
covenant
,
to
fight
for
the
liberty
of
the
Nephites
;
yea
,
to
protect
the
land
unto
_
the
laying
down
of
their
lives
;
yea
,
even
they
covenanted
that
they
never
would
give
up
their
liberty
,
but
they
would
fight
in
all
cases
to
protect
the
Nephites
and
themselyes
fro
bondage
.
Now
behold
,
there
were
two
thousand
of
those
young
men
which
entered
into
this
covenant
,
and
took
their
weapons
of
war
to
defend
their
country
.
And
now
behold
,
as
they
never
had
hitherto
been
a
disadvantage
to
the
Nephites
,
they
became
now
at
this
period
of
time
also
a
great
support
;
for
they
took
their
,
weapons
of
war
,
and
they
would
that
Helaman
should
le
their
leader
.
And
they
were
all
young
men
,
and
they
were
exceeding
valiant
for
courage
,
and
also
for
strength
and
acti
:
vity
;
but
behold
,
this
was
notall
:
they
were
men
which
were
true
at
all
times
in
whatsoever
thing
they
were
entrusted
;
yea
,
they
were
men
of
truth
and
soberness
,
for
they
had
beea
taught
to
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
to
walk
upright
ly
before
him
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Helaman
did
march
at
the
head
of
his
two
thousand
stripling
soldiers
,
to
the
support
of
the
people
in
the
borders
of
the
land
on
the
south
,
by
the
[File:381]
West
Sea
.
And
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
eigth
year
of
the
rign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
&c
.
ea

CHAPTER
Xxv
.
Ap
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
of
the
Judges
,
that
Ammoron
sent
unto
Moroni
,
desiring
that
he
would
exchange
prisoners
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
{et
to
rejoice
exceedingly
at
this
request
,
for
he
desired
the
povisions
which
was
imparted
for
the
support
of
the
Lamanxeprisoners
,
for
the
support
of
his
own
people
;
and
he
also
desired
his
own
people
for
the
strengthening
of
his
army
.—
Now
the
Lamanites
had
taken
many
women
and
children
;
and
there
was
not
a
woman
nor
a
child
among
all
the
prisoners
of
Moroni
,
or
the
prisoners
which
Moroni
had
taken
;
therefore
Moroni
resolved
upon
a
stratagem
,
to
obtain
as
many
prisonsof
the
Nephites
from
the
Lamanites
,
as
it
were
possible
;
lierefore
he
wrote
an
epistle
,
and
sent
it
by
the
servant
of
Ammoron
,
the
same
who
had
brought
an
epistle
to
Moroni
.
Now
these
are
the
words
which
he
wrote
unto
Ammoron
,
saying
:
Behold
,
Ammoron
,
I
have
wrote
unto
you
somewhat
contoning
this
war
which
ye
have
waged
against
my
people
,
or
miler
which
thy
brother
hath
waged
against
them
,
and
which
yeare
still
determined
to
carry
on
after
his
death
.
Behold
,
I
rould
tell
you
something
concerning
the
justice
of
God
,
and
ite
sword
of
his
Almighty
wrath
,
which
doth
hang
over
you
:
Except
ye

and

into

or

which
is

land
of

;
yea
,
I
would
tell
you
these
things
,
if
ye
were
capable
ithearkening
unto
them
;
yea
,
I
would
tell
you
concerning

awful
hell
that
awaits
to
receive
such
murderers
as
thou
nd
thy
brother
hath
been
,
except
ye
repent
and
withdraw
jour
murderous
purposes
,
and
return
with
your

but
as

and

to
Moroni
,
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Moroni
had
received
this
isle
,
he
was
more
angry
,
because
he
knew
that
-
Ammoron
jd
a
perfect
knowledge
of
his
fraud
;
yea
,
he
knew
that
Aro>
noron
knew
that
it
was
nota
just
cause
that
had
caused
hive
wage
a
war
against
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
he
said
,
Bebold
,
1
will
not
exchange
prisoners
with
Ammoron
,
save
he
rill
withdraw
his
purpose
,
as
I
have
stated
in
my
epistle
;
for
Jwill
net
grant
unto
hint
that
he
shall
have
any
more
power
fun
what
he
hath
got
.
Behold
,
I
know
the
place
where
the
lamanites
doth
guard
my
people
,
which
they
have
taken
pris+
mers
;
and
as
Ammoron
would
not
grant
unto
me
mine
episk
,
behold
,
I
will
give
unto
him
according
to
my
words
;
yea
,
Iwill
seek
death
among
them
,
until
they
shall
suc
for
peace
.
dadnow
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Moroni
had
said
these
forls
,
he
caused
that
a
search
should
be
made
among
bis
en
,
that
perhaps
he
might
find
a
man
which
was
a
descend
tof
Laman
among
them
.
i
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
found
one
,
whose
name
was
lanan
;
and
he
was
one
of
the
servants
of
the
king
which
was
tudered
by
Amalickiah
.
Naw
Moroni
caused
that
Laman
tla
small
number
of
his
mon
,
should
go
forth
unto
the
guards
ch
were
over
the
Nephites
.
Now
the
Nephites
were
yuarlin
the
city
of
Gid
;
therefore'
Moroni
caused
that
Laman
iM
smali
number
of
men
which
was
appointed
to
go
with
.
Andit
came
to
pass
that
when
it
was
evening
,
Laman
went
othe
guards
which
were
over
the
Nephites
,
and
behold
,
they
him
coming
,
and
they
hailed
him
.
But
he
saith
unto
Fear
not
.
Behold
,
ama
Lamanite
.
Behold
,
we
have
ed
from
the
Nephites
,
and
they
sleepeth
;
and
behold
,
we
took
of
their
wine
,
and
brought
with
us
.
Now
when
the
anites
heard
these
words
,
they
received
him
with
joy
.—
they
said
unto
him
,
Give
us
of
your
wine
,
that
we
may
[File:384]
drink
;
we
are
glad
that
ye
have
thus
taken
wine
with
y
for
we
are
weary
.
But
Laman
saith
unto
them
,
Let
ush
of
our
wine
till
we
go
against
the
Nephites
to
battle
.
Buty
,
saying
only
made
them
more
desirous
to
drink
of
the
wine
.
For
,
said
they
,
We
are
weary
;
therefore
let
us
take
of
i
wine
,
and
by
and
by
we
shall
receive
wine
for
our
raj
which
will
strengthen
us
to
go
against
the
Nephites
.
And]
,
man
saith
unto
them
,
You
may
do
according
to
your
desig
)
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
take
of
the
wine
freely
,
it
was
pleasant
to
their
taste
;
therefore
they
took
of
itme
freely
;
and
it
was
strong
,
having
been
prepared
in
its
streng
)
And
it
came
to
pass
they
did
drink
and
were
merry
,
ands}
and
by
they
were
all
drunken
.
And
now
when
Laman
ands
men
saw
that
they
were
all
drunken
,
and
were
in
a
deeps
they
returned
to
Moroni
,
and
told
him
all
the
things
that
happened
.
And
now
this
was
according
to
the
design
of
roni
.
And
Moroni
had
prepared
his
men
with
weapon
war
;
and
he
went
to
the
city
Gid
,
while
the
Lamanites
sj
ina
deep
sleep
,
and
drunken
,
and
cast
in
the
weapons
ofm
in
unto
the
prisoners
,
insomuch
that
they
were
all
ami
yea
,
even
to
their
women
,
and
all
those
of
their
children
many
as
were
able
to
use
a
weapon
of
war
;
when
Mi
had
armed
all
those
prisoners
.
And
all
those
things
were
ina
profound
silence
.
Butshad
they
awoke
the
Laman
behold
they
were
drunken
,
and
the
Nephites
could
have
dt
them
.
But
behold
this
was
not
the
desire
of
Moroni
.
Te
not
delight
in
murder
or
bloodshed
;
but
he
delighted
in
saving
of
his
people
from
destruction
;
and
for
this
cau}
might
not
bring
upon
him
injustice
,
he
would
not
fall
upoa
Lamanites
and
destroy
them
in
their
drunkennes
,
But
helt
obtained
his
desires
;
for
he
had
armed
those
prisoners
df
!
Nephites
which
were
within
the
wall
of
the
cily
,
and
had
them
power
to
gain
possession
of
those
parts
which
within
the
walls
;
and
then
he
caused
the
men
which
were™
him
,
to
withdraw
a
pace
from
them
,
and
surround
the
a
of
the
Lamanites
.
Now
behold
,
this
was
done
in
thet
time
,
so
that
when
the
Lamanites
awoke
in
the
morning
,
beheld
that
they
were
surronded
by
the
Nephites
wi
and
that
their
prisoners
were
armed
within
,
And_
thus
saw
that
the
Nephites
had
power
over
them
;
and
in
thr
cumstances
they
found
that
it
was
not
expedient
thal
!
should
fight
with
the
Nephites
;
therefore
their
Chief
Capit
demanded
their
weapons
of
war
,
and
they
brought
them
i
[File:385]
wd
cast
them
at
the
feet
of
the
Nephites
,
pleading
for
merg
.
Now
hebold
,
this
was
the
desire
of
Moroni
.
He
took
fiem
prisoners
of
war
,
and
took
possesion
of
the
city
,
and
used
that
all
the
prisoners
should
be
liberated
,
which
were
Nephites
;
and
they
.
did
join
the
army
of
Moroni
,
and
were
ggreat
strength
to
his
army
.
Andit
came
to
pass
that
he
did
cause
the
Lamanites
which
je
had
taken
prisoners
,
that
they
should
commence
a
labor
in
suengihening
the
fortifications
round
about
the
city
Gid
.
And
teame
to
pass
that
when
he
had
fortified
the
city
Gid
,
aceording
to
his
desires
,
be
caused
that
his
prisoners
should
be
talen
to
the
city
Bountiful
.
And
he
also
guarded
that
city
with
exceeding
strong
force
.
And
itcame
to
pass
that
they
did
,
winithstanding
all
the
intrigues
of
the
Lamanites
,
keep
and
potect
all
the
prisoners
which
they
had
taken
,
and
also
mainitin
all
the
ground
and
the
advantage
which
they
had
retaken
.
inditcame
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
began
again
to
,
be
victotous
,
and
to
reclaim
their
rights
and
their
privileges
.
Many
mes
did
the
Lamanites
attempt
to
encircle
them
about
by
mht
,
but
in
these
attempts
they
did
lose
many
prisoners
.—
dud
many
times
did
they
atempt
to
administer
of
their
wine
bthe
Nepbites
,
that
they
might
destroy
them
with
potson
or
tihdrunkenness
,
But
behold
,
the
Nephites
were
not
slow
to
mmember
the
Lord
their
God
,
in
this
their
times
of
affliction
.
They
could
not
be
taken
in
their
snares
;
yca
,
they
would
not
ferlake
of
their
wine
;
yea
,
they
would
not
take
of
wine
,
save
ey
had
firstly
given
to
some
of
the
Lamanite
prisoners
.
And
hy
were
thus
cautious
,
thai
no
poison
should
be
administeramong
them
;
for
if
their
wine
would
poison
a
Lamanite
,
it
tould
also
poison
a
Nephite
;
and
thus
they
did
try
all
their
ligors
.
And
now
it
came
.
to
pass
that
it
was
expedient
for
Moroni
to
make
preparations
to
attack
the
city
Morianton
.—
For
behold
,
the
Lamanites
had
,
by
their
labors
,
fortified
the
tty
Morionton
until
it
had
become
an
exceeding
strong
hold
;
al
they
were
continually
bringing
new
forces
into
that
city
,
adalso
new
supplies
of
provisions
.
And
thus
ended
the
eae
ot
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
Nephi
.

Anp
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
i
ticth
ycar
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
,
in
the
second
day
,
on
first
inonth
,
Moroni
received
an
epistle
from
Helaman
,
the
affairs
of
the
people
in
that
quarter
of
the
land
,
4
these
are
the
words
which
he
wrote
,
saying
:
My
dearly}
loved
brother
,
Moroni
,
as
well
in
the
Lord
as
in
the
i
tions
of
our
warfare
;
behold
,
my
beloved
brother
,
T
somewhat
to
tell
you
concerning
our
warfare
in
this
partofti
jand
.
Behold
,
two
thousand
of
the
sons
of
those
4
which
Ammon
brought
down
out
of
the
land
of
Nephi
:
Nal
ye
have
known
that
these
were
a
descendant
of
Laman
,
was
the
eldest
son
of
our
father
Lehi
.
Now
need
nots
hearse
unto
you
concerning
their
traditions
or
their
unbeb
for
thou
knowest
concerning
all
these
things
;
therefore
it
poseth
me
that
I
tell
you
that
two
thousand
of
these
yom
men
hath
taken
their
weapons
of
war
,
and
would
that]
be
their
leader
;
and
we
have
come
forth
to
defend
ovr
can
)
try
.
And
now
ye
also
know
concerning
the
covenant
mlit
their
fathers
made
,
that
they
would
not
take
up
their
wea
of
war
against
their
brethren
,
to
shed
blood
.
But
in
the
ty
and
sixth
year
,
when
they
saw
our
afilictions
and
our
lations
for
them
,
they
were
about
to
breuk
the
covenant
they
had
made
,
and
lake
up
their
weapons
of
war
in
ourk
fence
.
But
I
would
not
suffer
them
that
they
should
breakllj
covenant
which
they
had
made
,
supposing
that
God
streagthen
ns
,
insomuch
that
we
should
not
suffer
more}
cause
of
the
fulfilling
the
oath
which
they
had
taken
.
Bi
hold
,
here
is
one
thing
in
whieh
we
may
have
great
joy
.
fe
behold
,
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
,
1
Tlelaman
,
did
marle
the
head
of
these
two
thousand
young
men
,
to
the
city
off
dea
,
to
assist
Antipus
,
whom
ye
had
appointed
a
leadert®
ike
people
of
that
part
of
the
land
.
And
T
did
join
my
twolltt
sand
sons
,
(
for
they
are
worthy
to
be
called
sons
,)
to
the
?
my
of
Antipus
;
in
the
which
strength
Antipns
did
rejoicet
ceedingly
;
for
behold
,
bis
army
had
been
reduced
by
teh
manites
hecause
of
the
numerority
of
their
forces
having
a
vast
number
of
our
men
;
for
which
cause
we
have
tome
)
Nevertheless
,
we
may
console
ourselves
in
this
pointe™
they
have
died
in
te
cause
of
their
country
and
of
theirb®
yea
,
and
they
are
happy
.
And
the
Lamanites
had
alsose™®
ed
many
prisoners
,
all
of
whom
are
Chief
Captains
;
{oF
[File:387]
other
have
they
spared
alive
.
And
we
suppose
that
they
are
pow
al
this
time
in
the
land
of
Nephi
;
it
is
so
if
they
are
not
sain
.
And
now
these
are
the
cities
which
the
Lamanites
have
sbiained
possession
,
by
the
shedding
of
the
blood
of
so
many
ofour
valiant
men
:
>
The
land
of
Manti
,
or
the
city
of
Manti
,
nd
the
city
of
Zeezrom
,
and
the
city
of
Cumeni
,
and
the
city
of
Anliparah
.
And
these
are
the
cities
which
they
possessed
when
J
arrived
at
the
city
of
Judea
;
and
1
found
Antipus
and
lismen
toiling
with
their
mights
to
fortify
the
city
;
yea
,
and
ey
were
depressed
in
body
as
well
as
in
spirit
;
for
they
lad
fought
valiantly
by
day
,
and
toiled
hy
night
,
to
maintain
heir
cities
;
and
thus
they
had
suffered
great
afllictions
ofevewkind
.
And
now
they
were
determined
to
conquer
in
this
jlace
,
or
die
;
therefore
you
may
well
suppose
that
this
little
loce
which
T
brought
with
me
;
yea
,
those
sons
of
maine
,
gave
them
great
hopes
and
much
joy
.
¥
And
now
it
came
tovpass
that
when
the
Lamanites
saw
that
Antipus
bad
received
a
greater
strength
to
his
army
,
they
were
tompelled
,
by
the
orders
of
Ammoron
,
to
not
come
against
the
aly
of
Judea
,
or
against
us
,
to
battle
.
And
thus
were
wefawed
of
the
Lord
:
for
had
they
come
upon
us
in
this
our
Wakness
,
they
might
have
perhaps
destroycd
our
little
armny
5
bu
thus
were
we
preserved
.
They
were
commanded
by
Amtoronto
maintain
those
eitics
which
they
had
taken
.
And
thus
aided
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
.
And
in
the
commencement
ithe
twenty
and
seventh
year
,
we
had
prepared
our
city
and
wsclves
for
defenec
.
Now
we
were
desirous
that
the
LaMantes
should
come
upon
us
;
for
we
were
not
desirous
:
to
makean
attack
upon
them
in
their
strong
holds
.
And
it
came
pass
that
we
kept
spies
out
round
about
,
to
watch
the
moveuents
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
might
not
pass
us
by
night
,
tr
by
day
,
io
make
an
attack
upon
our
other
cities
,
whieh
Sere
on
the
northward
;
for
we
knew
in
those
cities
they
were
it
sufficiently
strong
to
meet
them
;
'
therefore
we
were
desius
,
if
they
should
pass
by
ns
,
to
fall
upon
them
in
their
rear
,
ad
thus
bring
them
up
in
the
rear
,
at
the
same
time
they
ere
met
inthe
front
.
We
supposed
that
we
could
overpower
™
;
but
behold
,
we
were
disappointed
in
this
our
desire
.
ey
durst
not
pass
by
us
with
their
whole
army
;
neither
ust
they
with
a
part
,
lest
they
should
not
be
sufliciently
tong
,
and
they
should
fall
.
Neither
durst
they
march
down
ainst_
the
city
of
Zarahemla
;
neither
durst
they
cross
the
pat
of
Sidon
,
over
to
the
city
of
Nephihah
..
And
thus
,
with
[File:388]
their
forces
,
they
were
determined
to
maintain
those
cities
which
they
had
taken
.
And
now
it
-
came
to
pass
,
in
the
second
month
of
this
year
,
there
was
brought
unto
us
many
provisions
,
from
the
fathers
of
those
my
two
thousand
sons
.
And
also
there
was
sent
-
4vo
thousand
men
unto
us
,
from
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
And
thus
we
were
prepared
with
ten
thousand
men
,
and
provisions
for
them
,
and
also
for
their
wives
,
and
their
children
.
And
the
Lamanites
,
thus
seeing
our
forces
increase
daily
,
and
provis
ions
arrive
for
our
support
,
they
began
to
be
fearful
,
and
be
gan
to
sally
forth
,
if
it
were
possible
,
to
put
an
end
to
our
re
ceiving
provisions
and
strength
.
Now
when
we
saw
that
the
Lamanites
began
to
grow
uneasy
on
this
wise
,
we
were
desirous
to
bring
a
stratagem
into
an
eflect
upon
them
;
therefore
Antipas
ordered
that
I
should
march
forth
with
my
little
sons
,
toa
neighboring
city
,
as
if
we
were
carrying
provisions
to
2
neighboring
city
.
And
we
were
to
march
near
the
city
Anti
parab
,
as
if
we
were
going
to
the
city
beyond
,
in
the
borders
,
by
the
seashore
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
march
forth
,
as
if
with
our
provisions
,
to
go
to
that
city
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Antipus
did
march
forth
,
with
a
part
of
his
army
,
leaving
the
remainder
to
maintain
the
city
.
But
he
did
not
march
forth
,
until
I
had
gone
forth
with
my
little
army
,
and
came
near
the
city
Antiparah
.
And
now
in
the
city
Ant
parah
,
were
stationed
the
strongest
army
of
the
Lamanites
;
yea
,
the
most
numerous
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
been
informed
by
their
spies
,
they
came
forth
with
ther
army
,
and
marched
against
us
.
And
it
came
1o
pass
that
we
did
flee
before
them
,
northwart
.
And
thus
we
did
lead
away
the
most
powerful
army
of
the
Lamanites
;
yea
,
even
to
a
considerable
distance
,
insomuch
that
when
they
saw
the
army
of
Antipus
pursuing
them
,
with
their
mights
,
they
did
not
turn
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
,
but
pursued
their
march
in
a_
straight
course
after
us
;
and
,
®
we
supposed
,
it
was
their
intent
to
slay
us
before
Antipus
should
overtake
them
,
and
this
that
they
might
not
he
sur
rounded
by
our
people
,
And
now
Antipus
,
beholding
out
danger
,
did
speed
the
march
of
bis
army
.
But
behold
,
it
wa
night
;
therefore
they
did
not
overtake
us
,
neither
did
Aut
pus
overtake
them
;
therefore
we
did
camp
for
the
night
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
before
the
dawn
of
the
mornitg
beheld
,
the
Lamanites
were
pursuing
us
.
Now
we
were
nal
sulliciently
strong
to
contend
with
them
;
yea
,
1
would
ol
[File:389]
safer
that
my
little
sons
should
fall
into
their
hands
;
therefore
we
did
continue
our
march
;
and
we
took
our
march
into
the
wilderness
.
Now
they
durst
not
turn
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
,
lest
they
should
be
surrounded
;
neither
would
IT
turn
to
the
night
or
to
the
left
,
lest
they
should
overtake
me
,
and
we
could
not
stand
against
them
,
but
be
slain
,
and
they
would
make
their
escape
;
and
thus
we
did
fcc
all
that
day
into
the
wilderness
,
even
until
if
was
dark
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
again
when
the
light
of
the
morning
eae
,
we
saw
the
Lamanites
upon
us
,
and
we
did
flee
before
fhem
,
But
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
not
pursue
us
far
,
belore
they
halted
;
and
it
was
in
the
morning
of
the
third
day
,
othe
seventh
month
.
And
now
whether
they
were
overtaken
by
Antipus
,
we
knew
not
;
but
I
said
unto
my
men
,
Behold
,
we
know
not
but
they
have
halted
for
the
purpose
that
we
should
come
against
them
,
that
they
might
catch
us
in
their
sare
;
therefore
,
what
say
ye
,
my
sons
,
will
ye
go
against
fiem
to
battle
?
And
now
I
say
unto
you
,
my
beloved
brother
Moroni
,
That
never
had
I
seen
so
great
courage
,
nay
,
not
anongst
all
the
Nephites
.
For
as
I
had
ever
called
them
my
sons
,
(
for
they
were
all
of
them
very
young
,)
eyen
so
they
said
utome
,
Father
,
behold
,
our
God
is
with
us
,
and
he
will
not
suier
that
we
shall
fall
;
then
let
us
go
forth
;
we
would
not
say
our
brethren
,
if
they
would
Jet
us
alone
;
therefore
let
us
lest
they
should
overpower
the
army
of
Antipus
.
Now
they
never
had
fought
,
yet
they
did
not
fear
death
;
and
they
did
think
more
upon
the
liberty
of
their
fathers
,
than
they
did
pon
their
lives
;
yea
,
they
had
been
tought
by
their
mothers
,
that
they
did
not
doubt
,
that
God
would
deliver
them
.
And
hey
rehearsed
unto
me
the
words
of
their
mothers
,
saying
:
Wedo
not
doubt
our
mothers
knew
it
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
return
with
my
two
thousand
,
auinst
these
Lamanites
which
had
pursued
us
.
And
now
behold
,
the
armies
of
Antipus
had
overtaken
them
,
and
a
terrible
tattle
had
commenced
.
The
army
of
Antipns
heing
weary
,
hevause
of
their
Jong
march
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
,
were
about
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
Lamantes
;
and
had
I
not
iumed
with
my
two
thousand
,
they
would
have
obtained
their
purpose
:
for
Antipws
had
fallen
hy
the
sword
,
and
many
of
his
leaders
,
because
of
their
weariness
,
which
was
oscaSoned
by
the
speed
of
their
march
;
therefore
the
men
of
Anpus
being
confused
,
because
of
the
fall
of
their
leadens
.
bemn
to
give
way
before
the
Lamanites
.
[File:390]
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
took
courage
,
ani
began
to
pursue
them
;
and
thus
were
the
Lamanites
pursuing
them
with
great
vigor
,
when
[claman
came
upon
their
rear
with
his
two
thousand
,
and
began
to
slay
them
exceedingly
,
insomuch
that
the
whole
army
of
the
Lamanites
halted
,
and
turned
upon
Helaman
,
Now
when
the
people
of
Antipus
saw
that
the
Lamanites
had
turned
them
about
,
they
gathered
together
their
men
,
and
came
again
upon
the
rear
of
the
La
manites
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
we
,
the
people
of
Nephi
,
the
people
of
Antipus
,
and
I
with
my
two
thousand
,
did
surround
the
Lamanites
,
and
did
slay
them
;
yea
,
insomuch
that
they
were
compelled
to
deliver
up
their
weapons
of
war
,
and
also
themselves
as
prisoners
of
war
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
surrendered
themselves
up
unto
us
,
behold
,
I
numbered
those
young
men
which
had
fought
with
me
,
fearing
lest
there
were
many
of
them
slain
.
But
behold
,
to
my
great
joy
,
there
had
not
one
soul
of
them
fallen
to
the
earth
;
yea
,
and
they
had
fought
as
if
with
the
strength
of
God
;
yea
,
never
was
men
known
i
have
fought
with
such
miraculous
strength
;
and
with
such
mighty
power
did
they
fall
upon
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
did
frighten
them
;
and
for
this
cause
did
the
Lamanites
deliver
themselves
up
as
prisoners
of
war
.
And
as
we
had
no
place
for
our
prisoners
,
that
we
could
guard
them
to
keep
them
from
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
,
therefore
we
sent
them
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
a
part
of
those
men
which
wer
not
slain
of
Antipus
,
with
them
;
and
the
remainder
took
ant
joined
them
to
my
stripling
Ammonites
,
and
took
our
marh
back
to
the
city
of
Judea
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
I
received
an
epistle
from
Ammoron
,
the
king
,
stating
that
if
L
would
deliver
up
those
prisoners
of
war
which
we
had
taken
,
that
he
would
deliver
up
the
city
of
Antiparah
untous
,
But
-
I
sent
an
epistle
unto
the
king
,
That
we
were
sure
our
forces
were
sufficient
to
take
the
city
of
Antiparah
by
our
foree
;
and
by
delivering
up
the
prisoners
for
that
city
,
we
should
suppose
ourselves
unwist
and
that
we
would
only
deliver
up
our
prisoners
on
exchange
.
-
And
Ammoron
refused
mine
epistle
,
for
he
would
not
exchange
prisoners
;
therefore
we
began
to
make
preparations
to
gt
against
the
city
of
Antiparah
.
But
the
people
of
Antipasah
did
leave
the
city
,
and
fled
to
their
-
other
cities
which
the
had
possession
of
,
to
fortify
them
;
and
thus
the
cily
of
Ant
[File:391]
parah
fell
into
our
hands
.
And
thus
ended
the
iwenty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
commenecment
of
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
,
we
received
a
supply
of
provisions
,
and
also
an
addition
to
our
army
,
from
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
from
the
land
found
about
,
to
the
number
of
six
thousand
men
,
besides
sixty
of
the
sons
of
the
Ammonites
,
which
had
come
to
join
their
brethren
,
my
little
band
of
two
thousand
.
And
now
behold
,
we
were
strong
;
yea
,
and
we
had
also
a
plenty
of
provisions
brought
unto
us
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
our
desire
ta
wage
a
battle
with
the
army
which
was
placed
to
protect
the
city
Cumeni
.
And
now
behold
,
I
will
shew
unto
you
that
we
soon
accomplished
our
desire
;
yea
,
with
our
strong
force
,
or
with
a
part
of
our
strong
force
,
we
did
surround
,
by
night
,
the
city
Cumeni
,
a
little
before
they
were
to
receive
a
supply
of
provisons
.
And
it
eame
to
pass
that
we
did
camp
round
about
the
city
for
many
nights
;
but
we
did
sleep
upon
our
swords
,
and
keep
guards
,
that
the
Lamanites
could
not'
come
upon
us
by
nighl
,
and
slay
us
,
which
they
attempted
many
times
;
but
as
many
times
as
they
attempted
this
,
their
blood
was
spilt
.
At
length
their
provisions
did
arrive
,
and
they
were
about
to
enter
the
aity
by
night
.
And
we
,
instead
of
being
Lamanites
,
were
Nephites
;
therefore
,
we
did
take
them
and
their
provisions
,—
And
notwithstanding
the
Lamanites
being
cut
off
from
their
support
after
this
manner
,
they
were
still
determined
to
maintain
the
city
;
therefore
it
became
expedient
that
we
should
take
those
provisions
and
send
them
to
Judea
and
our
prisoners
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
net
many
days
had
passed
away
,
before
the
Lamanites
began
to
lose
all
hopes
of
succor
;
therefore
they
yielded
up
the
city
into
our
hands
;
and
thus
we
had
accomplished
our
designs
,
in
obtaining
the
city
Cumcni
,
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
our
prisoners
were
so
numerous
,
tliat
notwithstanding
the
enormity
of
our
numbers
,
we
were
obliged
to
employ
all
our
force
to
keep
them
,
or
to
put
them
to
death
.
For
behold
,
they
would
break
out
in
great
numbers
,
and
Would
fight
with
stones
,
and
with
clubs
,
or
whatsoever
things
they
could
get
into
their
hands
,
insomuch
that
we
did
slay
upwards
of
two
:
thousand
of
them
,
after
they
had
surrendered
themselves
prisoners
of
war
;
therefore
it
became
expedient
for
us
,
that
we
should
put
an
end
to
their
lives
,
or
guard
them
,
sword
in
hand
,
down
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
and
alsa
our
[File:392]
provisions
were
not
any
more
than
sufficient
for
our
own
peo
ple
,
notwithstanding
that
which
we
had
taken
from
the
La
.
manites
.
now
,
in
those
critical
circumstances
,
it
became
a
very
serious
matter
to
determine
concerning
these
prisoners
of
war
;
ueverthcless
,
we
did
resolve
to
send
them
down
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
therefore
we
selected
a
part
of
our
men
,
and
gaye
them
charge
over
our
prisoners
,
to
go
down
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
,
they
did
return
.—
And
now
behold
,
we
did
not
inquire
of
them
concerning
the
prisoners
;
for
behold
,
the
Lamanites
were
upon
us
,
and
they
returned
in
season
to
save
us
from
falling
into
their
hands
.—
For
behold
,
Ammon
had
sent
to
their
support
a
new
supply
of
provisions
,
and
also
a
numerous
army
of
men
,
And
it
came
fo
pass
that
those
men
which
we
sent
with
the
prisoners
,
did
arrive
in
season
to
check
them
,
as
they
were
about
to
overpower
ns
.
But
behold
,
my
little
band
of
tro
thousand
and
sixty
,
fought
most
desperately
;
yea
,
they
were
firm
before
the
Lamanites
,
and
did
administer
death
unto
all
those
who
opposed
them
;
and
as
the
remainder
of
our
anny
were
about
to
give
way
before
the
Lamanites
,
behold
,
those
two
thousand
and
sixty
were
firm
and
undaunted
;
yea
,
and
_
they
did
obey
and
observe
to
perform
every
word
of
command
with
exactness
;
yea
,
and
eyen
according
to
their
faith
,
it
was
done
unto
them
;
and
I
did
remember
the
words
which
they
said
unto
me
that
their
mothers
had
taught
them
.
And
now
behold
,
it
was
thesc
,
my
sons
,
and
those
men
which
had
been
selected
to
convey
the
prisoners
,
to
whom
we
owe
this
great
victory
;
for
it
was
they
who
did
beat
the
Lamanites
;
therefore
they
were
driven
back
to
the
eity
of
Manti
.
And
we
retained
our
city
Cumeni
,
and
were
not
all
destroyed
by
the
sword
;
nevertheless
,
we
had
suffered
great
loss
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
Lamanites
had
fled
,
Timmediately
gave
orders
that
my
men
which
had
been
wounded
,
should
be
taken
from
among
the
dead
,
and
caused
that
their
wounds
should
be
dressed
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
two
hundred
,
out
of
my
two
thousand
and
sixty
,
which
had
fainted
because
of
the
loss
of
blood
;
nevertheless
,
according
to
the
goodness
of
God
,
and
to
our
great
astonishment
,
and
also
the
foes
of
our
whole
army
,
there
was
not
one
soul
of
them
which
did
perish
;
yea
,
and
neither
was
there
one
soul
among
them
which
had
not
reecived
many
wounds
.
And
now
,
their
preservation
was
astonishing
to
our
whole
arniys
[File:393]
yea
,
that
they
should
be
spared
,
while
there
w
:
thousand
of
our
brethren
which
were
slain
.
And
we
dolby
ascribe
it
fo
the
miraculous
power
of
God
,
because
of
their
exceeding
faith
in
that
which
they
had
been
taught
to
believe
,
that
there
was
a
just
God
;
and
whosoever
did
not
doubt
,
that
they
should
be
preserved
by
his
marvellous
power
,
Now
this
was
the
faith
of
these
of
which
T
hayc
spoken
;
they
are
young
,
and
their
minds
are
firm
;
and
they
do
put
their
trust
in
God
continually
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
afier
we
had
thus
taken
care
of
our
wounded
men
,
and
had
buried
our
dead
,
and
also
the
dead
of
the
Lamanites
,
which
were
many
,
behold
,
we
did
inquire
of
Gid
concerning
the
prisoners
which
they
had
started
to
go
down
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
with
.
Now
Gid
was
the
Chief
Captain
over
the
band
which
was
appointed
to
guard
them
down
to
the
land
.
And
now
,
these
are
the
words
which
Gid
said
unto
me
:
Behold
,
we
did
start
to
go
down
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
with
our
prisoners
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
meet
the
spies
of
our
armies
,
which
had
been
sent
out
o
watch
the
camp
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
they
cried
unto
us
,
saying
:
Behold
,
the
armics
of
the
Lamanites
are
a
marching
towards
the
city
of
Cumeni
;
and
behold
,
they'
will
fall
upon
them
,
yea
,
and
will
destroy
our
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
our
prisoners
did
hear
their
cries
,
which
caused
them
to
take
courage
;
'
and
they
did
rise
up
in
rebellion
against
us
,
And
it
came
to
pass
because
of
their
tebellion
,
we
did
cause
that
our
swords
should
come
upon
then
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
,
in
a
body
,
run
upon
our
swords
,
in
the
which
,
the
greater
number
of
them
were
slain
;
and
the
remainder
of
them
broke
through
and
fled
from
us
,
And
behold
,
when
they
had
fled
,
and
we
could
not
overake
them
,
we
took
our
march
with
speed
towards
the
city
Cumeni
;
and
behold
,
we
did
arrive
in
time
that
we
might
assist
our
brethren
in
preserving
the
city
.
And
behold
,
we
are
again
delivered
out
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies
.
And
blessed
is
thename
of
our
God
:
for
behold
,
it
is
he
that
hath
delivered
us
;
yea
,
that
hath
done
this
great
thing
for
us
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
J
,
Helaman
,
had
heard
these
Words
of
Gid
,
I
was
filled
with
exceeding
joy
,
because
of
the
s00dness
of
God
in
preserving
us
,
that
we
might
not
all
perish
;
yea
,
and
I
trust
that
the
souls
of
them
which
has
been
skein
;
have
entered
into
the
rest
of
their
God
.
_
And
heliold
,
now
it
came
to
pass
that
our
next
object
was
[File:394]
to
obtain
the
city
of
Manti
;
but
behold
,
there
was
no
way
thai
we
could
them
out
of
the
city
,
by
our
small
bands
,
For
behold
,
they
remembered
that
which
we
had
hitherto
done
;
therefore
we
could
not
decoy
them
away
from
their
strong
holds
;
and
they
were
so
exceedmg
more
pumerous
than
was
our
army
,
that
we
durst
not
go
forth
and
attack
them
in
their
strong
holds
.
Yea
,
and
it
became
expdient
that
we
should
employ
our
men
,
to
the
maintaining
those
parts
of
the
land
,
of
the
which
we
had
retained
of
our
possessions
;
therefore
it
became
expedient
that
we
should
wait
,
that
we
might
receive
more
strength
from
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
also
a
new
supply
of
provisions
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
thus
did
send
an
embassy
to
the
governor
of
our
Jand
,
to
acquaint
him
concerning
the
affairs
of
our
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
wait
to
receive
rovisions
and
strength
,
from
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
Butbe
:
old
,
this
did
not
profit
us
but
little
:
for
the
Lamanites
were
also
receiving
great
strength
,
{rom
day
to
day
,
and
alse
many
provisions
;
and
thus
were
our
circumstances
at
this
period
of
time
.
And
the
Lamanitas
were
sallying
forth
against
us
,
from
time
to
time
,
resolving
by
stratagem
,
to
destroy
us
;
ney
ertheless
,
we
could
not
come'
to
battle
with
them
,
because
of
their
retreats
and
their
strong
holds
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
wait
in
these
difficult
cir
cumstances
,
for
the
space
of
many
months
,
even
until
we
wert
about
to
perish
forthe
want
of
food
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
receive
food
,
which
was
guarded
to
us
by
an
army
two
thousand
men
,
to
our
assistance
;
and
this
is
all
the
.
as
tance
which
we
did
receive
,
to
defend
ourselves
and
our
coun
try
from
fallmg
into
the
hands
of
our
enemies
;
yea
,
to
car
tend
with
an
enemy
which
was
innumerable
.
And
now
fhe
cause
of
these
our
embarrassments
,
or
the
cause
why
they
did
not
send
more
strength
unto
us
,
we
knew
not
;
therefore
we
were
grieved
,
and
also
filled
with
fear
,
lest
by
any
means
the
judgements
of
God
should
come
upon
our
land
,
te
our
ove
throw
and
utter
destruction
;
therefore
we
did
pour
out
oll
souls
in
prayer
to
God
,
that
he
would
strengthen
us
and
der
yer
us
out
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies
;
yea
,
and
also
give
strength
,
that
we
might
retain
our
cities
,
and
our
Janis
,
40
!
our
possessions
,
for
the
support
of
our
people
,
Yea
,
andi
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
our
God
did
visit
us
with
asi
ances
,
that
he
would
deliver
us
;
yea
,
insomuch
that
he
did
speak
peace
to
our
souls
,
and
did
grant
unto
us
as
great
faith
,
[File:395]
and
did
cause
us
that
we
should
hope
for
our
deliverance
in
him
;
and
we
did
take
courage
with
our
sinall
force
which
we
had
received
,
and
were
fixed
with
a
determination
to
conquer
our
enemies
,
and
to
maintain
our
lands
,
and
our
possessions
,
and
our
wives
,
and
.
our
children
,
and
the
cause
of
our
liberty
.
And
thus
we
did
go
forth
with
all
our
might
against
the
Lamanites
,
which
were
in
the
city
of
Manti
;
and
we
did
pitch
our
tents
by
the
wilderness
side
,
which
was
near
to
the
city
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
,
that
when
the
Lamanites
saw
that
we
were
in
the
borders
by
the
wilderness
which
was
near
the
city
,
that
they
scut
out
their
spies
round
about
us
,
that
they
might
discover
the
number
and
the
strength
of
our
army
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
saw
that
we
were
not
strong
,
according
to
our
numbers
,
and
fearing
that
we
should
cut
them
off
from
their
support
,
except
they
should
come
out
to
battle
against
us
,
and
kill
us
,
and
also
supposing
that
they
could
easily
destroy
us
with
their
numerous
hosts
,
therefore
they
began
to
make
preparations
to
come
out
against
us
to
tattle
.
And
when
we
saw
that
they
were
making
preparaions
to
come
out
aguinst
us
,
behold
,
]
caused
that
Gid
,
with
a
small
number
of
men
,
should
secrete
himselfin
the
wilderness
,
and
also
that
Teomner
should
,
with
a
small
number
of
men
,
secrete
themselves
also
in
the
wilderness
.
Now
Gid
and
his
men
was
on
the
right
,
and
the
others
on
the
Jeft
;
and
when
they
had
thus
secreted
themselves
,
behold
,
remained
with
the
remainder
of
my
army
,
in
that
same
place
where
we
had
first
pitched
our
tents
,
against
the
time
that
the
Lamanites
should
come
out
to
battle
.
J
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
come
out
with
their
numerous
army
against
us
.
And
when
they
had
come
,
and
were
about
to
fall
upon
us
with
the
sword
,
I
caused
that
fny
men
,
those
which
were
with
me
,
should
retreat
into
the
wilderness
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
follow
after
us
with
great
speed
,
for
they
were
exceedingly
desirous
to
overtake
us
,
that
they
might
slay
us
;
therefore
they
did
follow
us
into
the
wilderness
;
and
we
did
pass
by
in
the
,
midst
of
Gid
and
Tcomner
,
insomuch
that
they
were
not
discovered
by
the
Lamanites
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lamanites
had
passed
by
,
or
when
the
army
had
passed
by
,
Gid
and
Teomner
did
Hse
up
from
their
secret
places
,
and
ae
cut
off
the
spies
of
[File:396]
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
should
not
return
to
the
city
.
Andi
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
cut
them
off
,
they
ran
to
ihe
city
,
and
fell
upon
the
guards
which
were
left
toguard
the
city
,
insomuch
that
they
did
destroy
them
,
and
did
take
possession
of
the
city
.
Now
this
was
done
,
because
the
Lamanites
dij
suffer
their
whole
army
,
save
a
few
guards
only
,
to
be
led
away
into
the
wilderness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Gid
and
Teomner
,
by
this
means
had
obtained
possession
of
their
strong
holds
.
And
it
came
tp
pass
that
we
took
our
course
,
after
having
travelled
much
in
the
wilderness
,
towards
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
And
whe
the
Lamanites
saw
that
they
were
marching
towards
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
they
were
exceeding
fraid
,
lest
there
was
a
plan
laid
to
lead
them
on
to
destruction
;
therefore
they
began
(
o
retreat
into
the
wilderness
again
,
yea
,
even
back
by
the
sam
way
which
they
had
came
.
And
behold
,
it
was
night
,
ani
they
did
pitch
their
tents
;
for
the
Chief
Captains
of
the
Le
manites
had
supposed
that
the
Nephites
were
weary
,
because
of
their
march
;
and
supposing
that
they
had
driven
ther
whole
army
,
therefore
they
took
no
thought
concerning
th
cily
of
Manti
,
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
it
was
night
,
that
1
cause
that
my
men
should
not
sleep
,
but
that
they
should
mamh
forward
,
by
another
way
,
towards
the
land
of
Manti
,
And
he
cause
of
this
our
march
in
the
night
time
,
behold
,
on
the
mor
row
,
we
were
beyond
the
Lamanites
,
insomuch
that
we
did
arrive
before
them
to
the
city
of
Manti
,
And
thus
it
came
to
pass
,
that
by
this
stratagem
,
we
did
take
possession
of
the
city
:
of
Manti
,
without
the
shedding
of
blood
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
did
arrive
near
the
city
,
and
saw
that
we
were
prepared
ta
meet
them
,
they
were
astonished
exceedingly
,
and
struck
with
great
fear
,
insomuch
that
they
did
flee
into
the
wilderness
—
¥ea
,
and
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
dil
flee
out
of
all
this
quarter
of
the
land
.
But
behold
,
they
have
carried
with
them
many
women
and
children
out
of
the
land
And
those
cities
which
had
been
taken
by
the
Lamanites
,
al
of
them
are
at
this
period
of
time
,
in
our
possession
;
and
out
fathers
,
and
our
women
,
and
our
children
,
are
returning
t0
their
homes
,
all
save
it
be
those
which
have
been
taken
pi
oners
and
carried
off
by
the
Lamanites
.
But
behold
,
our
al
mies
are
small
,
to
maintain
so
great
a
number
of
cities
,
and
great
possessions
.
But
behold
,
we
trust
that
our
God
,
wh
?
[File:397]
hath
given
us
victory
over
those
lands
,
insomuch
that
we
have
obtained
those
cities
and
those
lands
,
which
were
our
own
.
Now
we
do
not
know
the
cause
that
the
government
does
not
grant
us
more
strength
;
neither
do
those
men
which
came
up
unto
us
,
know
why
we
have
not
received
qgeater
strength
.
Behold
,
we
do
not
know
but
what
ye
are
successful
,
and
ye
have
drawn
away
the
forces
into
that
quarter
of
the
land
;
if
so
,
we
do
not
desire
to
murmur
.
And
ifitis
not
so
,
behold
,
we
fear
that
there
is
some
faction
in
the
covernment
,
that
they
do
not
send
more
men
to
our
assistance
;
for
we
know
that
they
are
more
numerous
than
that
which
they
have
sent
.
But
behold
,
it
mattereth
not
;
we
trust
God
will
deliver
us
,
notwithstanding
the
weakness
of
our
armies
,
yea
,
and
deliver
us
out
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies
.—
Behold
,
this
is
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
,
in
the
latter
end
,
and
we
are
in
the
possesssomof
ourlands
;
and
the
Lamanites
have
fled
to
the
land
of
Nephi
.
And
those
sons
of
the
people
of
Ammon
,
of
which
I
have
so
highly
spoken
,
are
with
me
in
thecity
of
Manti
;
and
the
Lord
hath
supported
them
,
yea
,
and
kept
them
from
falling
by
the
sword
,
insomuch
that
even
one
soul
hath
not
been
slain
.
But
behold
,
they
have
received
maay
wounds
;
nevertheless
they
stand
fast
in
that
liberty
wherewith
God
hath
made
them
free
;
and
they
are
strict
to
remember
the
Lord
their
God
,
from
day
to
day
;
yea
,
they
do
obseve
to
keep
his
statutes
,
and
his
judgements
,
and
his
commandments
continually
;
and
their
faith
is
strong
in
the
prophtcies
concerning
that
which
is
to
come
.
And
now
my
beloved
brother
Moroni
,
that
the
Lord
our
God
who
hath
redeemed
asand
made
us
free
,
may
keep
you
continnally
in
his
prestice
;
yea
,
and
that
he
may
favor

CHAPTER
XXVIl
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
udges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
after
Moroni
had
received
and
had
yead
Helaman's
epistle
,
he
was
exceedingly
rejoiced
because
of
the
welfare
,
yea
,
the
exceeding
success
which
He®
[File:398]
Jaman
had
had
,
in
obtaining
those
lands
which
were
lost
;
yu
,
and
he
did
make
it
known
unto
all
his
people
in
all
the
ig
round
about
in
that
part
where
he
was
,
that
they
might
rejoig
also
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
immediately
sent
an
epistle
Pahoran
,
desiring
that
he
should
cause
men
to
he
gatheredig
gether
,
to
strengthen
Helaman
,
or
the
armies
of
Helaman
,
i
somuch
that
he
might
with
ease
maintain
that
part
of
the
linj
which
he
had
been
so
miraculously
prospered
in
retaining
—
And
it
came
to
pass
when
Moroni
had
sent
this
epistle
tot
,
land
of
Zarahemla
,
he
began
again
to
lay
a
plan
,
that
he
migy
obtain
the
remainder
of
those
possessions
and
cities
which
ty
Lamanites
had
taken
from
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
while
Moroni
was
thus
makig
preparations
to
go
against
the
Lamanites
to
battle
,
behold
,
people
of
Nephiha
!:
which
were
gathered
together
from
the
cir
of
Moroni
,
and
the
city
of
Lehi
,
and
the
city
of
Moriantn
,
were
attacked
by
the
Lamanites
;
yea
,
even
those
which
lal
been
compelled
to
flee
from
the
land
of
Manti
,
and
from
tk
land
round
abeut
,
had
come
over
and
joined
the
Lamanitesi
this
part
of
the
land
;
and
thus
being
exceeding
numerous
,
ya
~and
receiving
strength
from
day
to
day
,
by
the
command
Ammoron
,
they
came
forth
against
the
people
of
Nephibih
and
they
did
begin
to
slay
them
with
an
exeeeding
gui
slaughter
.
And
their
armies
were
so
numerous
,
that
the
re
mainder
of
the
people
of
Nephihah
were
obliged
to
flee
befor
them
;
and
they
came
-
even
and
joined
the
army
of
Moroni
—
And
now
as
Moroni
had
supposed
that
there
should
bema
sent
to
the
city
of
Nephihah
,
to
the
assistance
of
the
people
to
maintain
that
city
,
and
knowing
that
it
was
easier
to
ke
the
city
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
than
b
retake
it
from
them
,
he
supposed'
that
they
would
eaill
maintain
that
city
;
therefore
he
retained
all
his
force
to
mit
tain
those
places
whieh
he
had
recovered
.
And
now
when
Moroni
saw
that
the
city
of
Nephihah
w#
lost
,
he
was
exceeding
sorrowful
,
and
began
to
doubt
,
becal®
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
,
whether
they
should
not
fl
into
the
hands
of
their
brethren
,
Now
this
was
the
case
will
all
his
Chief
Captaiis
.
They
doubted
and
marvelled
als
.
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
;
and
this
because
the
success
of
the
Lamanites
over
them
.
And
it
came
fo
pe
that
Moroni
was
angry
with
the
government
,
because
of
the
indifference
concerning
the
freedom
of
their
country
.
[File:399]
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
wrote
again
to
the
governor
of
the
land
,
which
was
Pahoran
,
and
these
are
the
words
which
je
wrote
,
saying
,
Behold
,
1
direct
mine
epistle
to
Pahoran
,
im
de
city
of
Zarahemla
,
which
is
the
Chief
Judge
and
the
goyanor
over

,
and
also
to
all
those
who
hath
been
chown
by
this
people
to
govern
and
manage
the
affairs
of
this
yar
;
for
behold
,
I
have
somewhat
to
say
unto
them
by
the
yay
of
condemnation
;
for
behold
,
ye
yoursclycs
know
that
jebave
been
appointed
to
gaiher
together
men
,
and
arm
them
with
swords
,
and
with
cimeters
,
and
all
manner
of
weapons
of

ma
,
of
every
kind
,
and
send
forth
against
the
Lamanites
,
m
whatsoever
parts
they
should
come
into
our
land
.
And
now
behold
,
say
unto
you
,
That
myself
,
and
also
my
men
,
and
ako
Helaman
and
his
men
,
have
suffered
exceeding
great
suffetiogs
;
-
yea
,
even
hunger
,
thirst
,
and
fatigue
,
and
all
manner
dfailictions
of
every
kind
.
But
behold
,
were
this
all
we
had
ufered
,
we
would
not
murmur
nor
complain
;
but
behold
,
geal
has
been
the
slaughter
among
our
people
;
yea
,
thousnds
have
fallen
by
the
sword
,
while
it
might
have
otheiiwise
len
,
if
ye
had
rendered
unto
our
armies
sufficient
strength
ad
succor
for
them
.
Yea
,
great
has
been
your
neglect
towards
us
.
And
now
behold
,
we
desire
to
knqw
the
cause
of
this
exceeding
great
neglect
;
yea
,
we
desire
to
know
the
cause
of
your
thoughiless
state
.
Can
you
think
to
sit
upon
your
(
hrones
,
in
a
state
of
thoughtless
stupor
,
while
your
enties
are
spreading
the
work
of
death
around
you
?
Yea
,
while
they
are
murdering
thousands
of
your
brethren
;
yea
,
ten
they
which
have
looked
up
to
you
for
protection
,
yea
,
—
fave
placed
you
in
a
situation
that
ye
might
have
succored
.
them
;
yea
,
ye
might
have
sent
armies
unto
them
,
to
have
siengthened
them
,
andhave
saved
thousands
of
them
from
filling
by
the
sword
?
But
behold
,
this
is
not
all
:
Ye
lave
Witbheld
your
-
provisions
fram
them
,
insomuch
that
many
have
fought
and
bled
out
their
lives
because
of
their
great
desires
Which
they
had
for
the
welfare
of
this
people
;
yea
,
and
this
they
hive
done
,
when
they
were
about
to
perish
with
hunger
,
betiuse
of
your
exceeding
great
negleet
towards
them
.
And
Tow
,
my
beloved
brethren
;
for
ye
had
ought
to
be
beloved
;
Yei
,
and
ye
had
onght
fo
have
stirred
yourselves
hore
diligently
forthe
welfare
and
the
freedom
of
this
people
:
but
behold
;
Jehave
neglected
them
,
insomuclr
that
the
blood
of
thousands
Shall
come
upon
your
heads
for
vengeance
;
yea
,
for
known
to
God
were
all
their
cries
,
and
all
their
sulferings
.
Behold
,
—
[File:400]
:
could
ye
suppose
that
ye
could
sit
upon
your
thrones
,
wy
because
of
the
exceeding
goodness
of
God
,
ye
could
do
nl
thing
,
and
he
would
deliver
you
?
Behold
,
if
ye
have
posed
this
,
ye
have
supposed
in
vain
.
Do
ye
Suppose
tly
because
so
many
of
your
brethren
have
been
killed
,
becay
!
of
their
wickedness
?
I
say
unto
you
,
if
ye
have
sup
this
,
ye
have
supposed
in
vain
:
for
I
say
unto
you
,
there
g
many
which
have
fallen
by
the
sword
;
and
behold
,
it
ie
)
your
condemnation
;
for
the
Lord
suffereth
the
righteous
gy
slain
,
that
his
justice
and
judgement
may
come
upon
the
wid
,
ed
;
therefore
ye
need
not
suppose
that
the
righteous
am
he
because
they
are
slain
;
but
behold
,
they
do
enter
into
the
py
of
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
now
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
fear
exceedingly
that
the
judgements
of
God
will
come
up
this
people
,
because
of
their
exceeding
slothfulness
;
jm
even
the
slothfulness
of
our
government
,
and
their
exceetiy
great
neglect
towards
their
brethren
,
yea
towards
those
whe
have
been
slain
:
For
were
it
not
for
the
wickedness
whi
firstcommenced
at
our
head
,
we
could
have
withstood
or
enemies
,
that
they
could
have
gained
no
power
over
us
;
ju
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
war
which
broke
out
among
ourselyes
,
yea
,
were
it
not
for
these
king
-
men
,
which
caused
so
mu
)
bloodshed
among
oureelyes
;
yea
,
at
the
time
we
were
conte
ding
among
ourselves
,
if
we
had
united
our
strength
,
as
te
hitherto
have
done
;
yea
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
desire
power
and
authority
which
those
king
-
men
had
over
us
5
hat
they
been
true
to
the
cause
of
our
freedom
,
and
united
with
w
and
gone
forth
against
our
enemies
,
instead
of
taking
up
the
swords
against
us
,
which
was
the
cause
of
so
much
blob
shed
among
ourselves
;
yea
if
we
had
gone
forth
against
them
.
the
strength
of
the
Lord
,
we
should'
have
dispersed
our
ene
mies
;
for
it
would
have
been
done
according
to
the
fulfillig
of
his
word
.
But
behold
,
now
the
Lamanites
are
coming
upit
us
,
and
they
are
murdering
our
people
with
the
sword
3
ye
our
women
and
our
children
;
taking
possession
of
our
lanit
and
also
carrying
them
away
captive
;
causing
them
that
the
should
suffer
all
manner
of
afflictions
;
and
this
because
of
tl
great
wickedness
of
those
who
are
seeking
for
power
and
at
thority
;
yea
,
even
those
king
-
men
,
But
why
should
I
sy
much
concerning
this
matter
,
for
we
know
not
but
what
yourselves
arc
seeking
for
authority
?
We
know
not
lit
what
ye
are
also
traitors
to
your
country
?
Or
is
it
that
have
neglected
us
because
ye
are
in
the
heart
of
our
count
,
[File:401]
gd
ye
are
surrounded
by
security
,
that
ye
do
not
cause
food
be
sent
unto
us
,
and
also
men
to
strengthen
our
armies
?
fave
ye
forgot
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
your
God
?
Iu
,
have
ye
forgot
the
captivity
of
our
fathers
?
Have
ye
igot
the
many
times
we
have
been
delivered
out
of
the
nls
of
our
enemies
?
Or
do
ye
suppose
that
the
Lord
will
illdeliver
us
,
while
we
sit
upon
our
thrones
,
and
do
not
make
eof
the
means
:
vhich
the
Lord
hath
provided
for
us
?
Yea
,
sllye
sit
in
tdleness
,
while
ye
are
surrounded
wiih
thousands

,
yea
,
and
tens
of

which
do
also
sit
in

while

round
about
im
the
berders
of

,
which
are
falling
by

Do
ye
suppose
that
God
will
look
upou
you
as
aiiless
,
while
ye
sit
still
and
behold
these
things
?
Behold
syunto
you
,
Nay
.
Now
I
would
that
ye
shouid
remember
aiGod
hath
said
that
The

and
then

And

Benoup
,
now
it
came
to
pass
that
soon
after
Moroni
#
sent
his

unto
the
Chief

,
he
received

from

CHAPTER
XXIX
.
ANp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Moroni
had
reccirtl
ibis
epistle
,
his
heart
did
take
courage
,
and
was
.
filled
wil
exceeding
great
joy
,
because
of
the
faithfulness
of
Pahort
that
be
was
not
also
a
traitor
to
the
freedom
and
cause
of
lis
country
.
But
he
did
also
mown
exceedingly
,
bacause
of
lit
iniquity
of
those
who
had
driven
Pahoran
from
the
judgemet
seat
;
yea
,
in
fine
,
because
of
those
who
had
rebelled
again
their
country
and
also
their
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
took
a
smal
number
@
men
,
according
to
the
desire
of
Pahoran
,
and
gave
Lehi
and
Teancum
command
oyer
the
remainder
of
his
army
,
and
t
:
[File:405]
his
march
towards
the
land
of
Gideon
.
And
he
did
raise
the
standard
of
liberty
in
whatsoever
place
he
did
enter
,
and
gained
whatsoever
force
he
could
in
all
his
march
towards
the
land
of
Gideon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
thousands
did
flock
unto
his
standard
,
and
did
take
up
their
swords
in
the
defence
of
their
free=
dom
,
that
they
might
not
come
into
bondage
.
And
thus
when
Moroni
had
gathered
together
whatsoever
men
he
could
in
all
his
march
,
he
came
to
the
land
of
Gideon
;
and
uniting
his
forces
with
that
of
Pahoran
,
they
became
exceeding
strong
,
even
stronger
than
the
men
of
Pachus
,
which
was
the
king
of
those
dissenters
which
had
driven
out
the
freemen
out
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
had
taken
possession
of
the
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
and
Pahoran
went
down
with
their
armies
into
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
went
forth
against
the
city
,
and
did
meet
the
men
of
Pachus
,
insomuch
that
they
did
come
to
battle
.
And
behold
,
Pachus
was
slain
,
aid
his
men
were
taken
prisoners
;
and
Pahoran
was
restored
iobis
judgement
seat
.
And
the
men
of
Pachus
received
their
inal
,
aecording
to
the
law
,
and
also
those
king
-
men
which
had
been
taken
and
cast
into
prison
;
and
they
were
executed
according
to
the
law
;
yea
,
those
men
of
Pachus
,
and
those
kingten
,
Whosoever
would
not
take
up
arms
in
the
defence
of
their
country
,
bui
would
fight
against
it
,
were
put
to
death
.—
And
thus
it
became
expedient
that
this
law
should
be
strictly
thserved
,
far
the
safety
of
their
country
;
yea
,
and
whosoever
was
found
denying
their
freedom
,
was
speedily
executed
according
tothe
luw
.
And
thus
ended
the
thirtieth
year
of
the
rign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
:
Moroni
and
Pahoran
having
restored
peace
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
among
heir
own
people
,
having
inflicted
death
upon
all
those
who
Were
not
true
to
the
cause
of
freedom
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
thirty
and
list
year
of
the
veign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
Moroni
immediately
caused
that
provisions
should
be
sent
,
and
ako
an
army
of
six
thousand
men
,
should
he
sent
unto
HelaMan
,
to
assist
him
in
preserving
that
part
of
(
he
land
;
and
he
ako
caused
that
an
army
of
six
thousand
men
,
with
a
sufficient
(
lantity
of
food
,
should
he
sent
to
the
armies
of
Lehj
and
Teacum
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
this
was
done
,
to
fortify
the
against
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
and
Palioran
,
leaving
a
Itrge
hody
of
men
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
took
their
march
[File:406]
with
a
large
body
of
men
towards
the
land
of
Nephihah
,
being
determined
to
overthrow
the
Lamanites
in
that
city
.
;
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
they
were
marching
towanls
the
land
,
they
took
a
large
body
of
men
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
slew
many
of
them
,
and
took
theirprovisions
,
and
their
weg
ons
of
war
,
And
it
came
to
pass
after
they
had
took
them
,
they
caused
them
to
enter
into
a
covenant
,
that
they
would
wu
more
take
up
their
weapons
of
war
against
the
Nephites
.
And
when
they
had
entered
into
this
covenant
,
they
sent
them
dwell
with
the
people
of
Ammon
;
and
they
were
in
number
about
four
thousand
,
which
had
not
heen
slain
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
sent
them
away
,
they
pursued
their
march
towards
the
land
of
Nephibah
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
come
to
the
city
Nephibah
they
did
pitch
their
tents
in
the
plas
of
Nephihah
,
which
is
near
the
city
Nephihah
.
Now
Moroni
was
desirous
that
the
Lamanites
should
come
out
to
battle
against
them
,
upon
tle
plains
;
but
the
Lamanites
knowing
of
their
exceeding
great
courage
,
and
beholding
the
greatness
of
their
numbers
,
ther
:
fore
they
durst
not
come
out
against
them
;
therefore
they
did
not
come
io
battle
in
that
day
.
And
when
the
night
came
,
Moroni
went
forth
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
,
and
came
upo
the
top
of
the
wall
to
spy
out
in
what
part
of
the
city
the
Le
manites
did
camp
with
their
army
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
on
the
east
,
by
the
en
tranee
;
and
they
were
all
asicep
,
And
now
Moroni
retumel
to
his
army
,
and
caused
that
they
should
prepare
in
liste
strong
cords
and
ladders
,
to
be
let
down
from
the
top
of
the
wall
into
the
inner
part
of
the
wall
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
thet
Moroni
caused
that
his
men
shoull
march
forth
and
come
upon
the
top
of
tie
wall
,
and
let
them
selves
downinto
that
part
of
the
city
,
yea
,
even
on
the
west
where
the
Lamanites
did
not
camp
with
their
armies
.
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
all
tet
down
into
the
cilf
by
night
,
by
the
means
of
their
strong
cords
and
their
Jaddem
thus
when
the
morning
came
,
they
were
all
within
the
walk
of
the
city
.
And
now
when
the
Lamanites
awoke
,
and
silt
that
the
armies
of
Moroni
were
within
the
walls
,
they
wet
affrighted
exceedingly
,
insomuch
that
they
did
flee
out
by
tlt
pass
,
And
now
when
Moroni
saw
that
they
were
fleeing
he
fore
him
,
he
did
cause
that
his
men
should
march
forth
agai
!
txem
,
and
slew
many
,
and
surrounded
many
others
and
&
tiem
prisoners
;
and
the
remainder
of
them
fled
into
the
Ja
[File:407]
of
Moroni
,
which
was
in
the
borders
by
the
seashore
.
Thus
had
Moroni
and
Pahoran
obtained
the
possession
of
the
city
of
Nephihah
,
without
the
loss
of
one
soul
;
and
there
were
many
of
the
Lamanites
which
were
slain
,
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
many
of
the
Lamanites
that
were
prisoners
,
were
desirous
to
join
the
people
of
Ammon
,
and
become
a
free
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
many
as
were
desirous
,
unto
them
it
was
granted
,
according
to
their
desires
;
therefore
all
the
prisoners
of
the
Lamanites
did
join
the
people
of
Ammon
,
and
did
begin
to
labor
exceedingly
,
tiljing
the
ground
,
raising
all
manner
of
grain
,
and
flocks
,
and
herds
of
every
kind
;
and
thus
were
the
Nephites
relieved
from
agreat
burthen
;
yea
,
insomuch
that
they
were
relicved
from
athe
prisoners
of
the
Lamanites
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
,
after
he
had
obtained
posxssion
of
the
city
of
Nephihah
,
having
taken
.
many
prisoners
,
which
did
reduce
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
execedingly
,
and
having
retained
many
of
the
Nephites
which
had
been
taken
prisones
,
which
did
strengthen
the
army
of
Moroni
exceedingly
;
therefore
Moroni
went
forth
from
ihe
land
of
Nephilah
to
the
land
of
Lehi
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lamanites
saw
that
Mowhi
was
a
coming
against
them
,
they
were
again
frightened
,
and
fled
before
the
army
of
Moroni
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
and
his
army
did
pursue
them
from
city
to
.
city
,
wl
they
were
met
by
Lehi
and
Teancum
;
and
the
Lamanites
Hed
from
Lehi
and
Teancum
;
even
down
upon
the
borders
by
the
seashore
,
until
they
came
to
the
land
of
Moroni
.
And
the
anies
of
the
Lamanites
were
all
gathered
together
,
insomuch
that
they
were
all
in
one
body
,
in
the
land
of
Moroni
.
Now
Ammoron
,
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
,
was
also
with
them
.
And
i{
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
,
and
Lehi
,
and
Teancum
,
id
encamp
with
their
armies
round
about
in
the
borders
of
the
land
of
Moroni
,
insomuch
that
the
Lamanites
were
en
-
'
tieled
about
in
the
borders
by
the
tilderness
,
on
the
south
,
imd
in
the
borders
by
the
wilderness
,
on
the
east
;
and
thas
they
did
encamp
for
the
night
...
For
behold
,
the
Nephites
ad
the
Lamanites
also
,
were
weary
because
of
the
greatness
ofthe
march
;
therefore
they
did
not
resolve
upon
any
stratasan
in
the
night
time
,
save
it
were
Teancum
:
for
he
was
ex
ivg
angry
with
Ammoron
,
insomuch
that
he
considered
thet
Aramoron
,
and
Amalickiah
his
brother
,
had
been
the
cause
this
great
and
lasting
war
between
them
and
the
Lamanites
,
]
[File:408]
which
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
war
and
bloodshed
,
yea
,
and
so
much
famine
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Teancum
,
in
his
anger
,
did
go
for
)
into
the
camp
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
did
let
himself
down
ove
the
walls
of
the
city
.
And
he
went
forth
with
a
cord
,
frop
place
to
place
,
insomuch
that
he
did
find
the
king
;
and
he
did
cast
a
javelin
.
at
him
,
which
did
pierce
him
near
the
hearts
But
behold
,
the
king
did
awake
his
servaut
before
he
diel
,
insomuch
that
they
did
pursue
Teancum
,
and
sles
him
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Lehi
and
Moroni
knew
that
Teancum
was
dead
,
they
were
excecding
sorrowful
:
for
4
hold
,
he
had
been
a
man
which
had
fought
valiantly
for
hi
country
,
yea
,
a
truc
friend
to
liberty
;
and
he
had
suffered
ve
many
exceeding
sore
afflictions
.
But
behold
,
he
was
dead
and
had
gone
the
way
of
all
the
earth
.
™
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
marched
forth
on
the
mar
row
,
and
came
upon
the
Lamanites
,
insomuch
that
they
di
slay
them
with
a
great
slaughter
;
and
they
did
drive
them
oi
of
the
land
;
and
they
did
flee
,
even
that
they
did
not
retin
at
that
lime
against
the
Nephites
.
And
thus
ended
the
thiny
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Ne
phi
;
and
thus
they
had
had
wars
,
and
bloodsheds
,
and
fan
.
me
,
and
allliction
,
for
the
space
of
many
years
.
And
ther
had
been
murders
,
and
contentions
;
and
dissensions
,
and
al
manner
of
iniquity
among
the
people
of
Nephi
;
neveriheles
,
for
the
righteous'
sake
,
yea
,
because
of
the
prayers
of
fle
righteous
,
they
were
spared
.
But
behold
,
because
of
the
&
ceeding
great
length
of
the
war
between
the
Nephites
and
lt
Lamanites
,
many
had
become
hardened
,
because
of
the
exc
ding
great
length
of
the
war
;
and
many
were
softened
,
hecaiw
of
their
afflictions
,
insomuch
that
they
did
humble
themselre
before
God
,
evenin
the
depth
of
humility
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Moroni
had
fortified
thee
parts
of
the
land
which
were
most
exposed
to
the
Lamaniitt
until
they
were
sufliciently
strong
,
he
returned
to
the
city
?
Zarahemla
,
and
also
Helaman
returned
to
the
place
of
lis
inheritance
;
and
there
was
once
more
peace
established
anioe
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
Moroni
yielded
up
the
comma
of
his
armies
into
the
hands
of
his
son
,
whose
name
was
Mt
ronihah
;
and
he
retired
to
his
own
house
,
that
he
might
sem
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
peace
.
And
Pahoran
did
refit
to
his
judgement
seat
;
and
Helaman
did
take
upon
him
ag
to
preach
unto
the
people
the
word
of
God
:
for
because
?
[File:409]
so
many
wars
and
contentions
,
it
had
become
expedient
that
aregulation
should
.
be
made
again
in
the
chnreh
;
therefore
Helaman
and
his
:
brethren
went
forth
,
and
did
declare
the
word
of
Gid
with
much
power
,
unto
the
convincing
of
many
people
of
their
wickedness
,
which
did
cause
them
to
repent
of
heir
sins
,
and
to
be
baptized
unto
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
establish
again
the
church
of
God
,
throughout
all
the
land
;
yea
,
and
regulations
were
made
concerning
the
law
.
And
their
Judges
,
and
their
Chief
Judges
were
chosen
.
And
the
people
of
Nephi
began
to
prosper
again
in
the
land
,
and
began
to
mult}
ply
and
to
wax
exceeding
strong
again
in
the
land
.
And
they
began'to
grow
exceeding
rich
;
but
notwithstanding
their
riches
,
or
their
strength
,
or
their
prosperity
,
they
were
not
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
eyes
;
neither
were
they
slow
io
remember
the
Lord
their
God
;
but
they
did
humble
themselves
:
exceedingly
before
him
;
yea
,
they
did
remember
how
great
things
the
Lord
had
done
for
them
,
that
he
had
delivered
them
from
death
,
and
from
tonds
,
and
from
prisons
,
and
from
all
manner
of
afilictions
;
ad
he
had
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
.
4nd
they
did
pray
unto
the
Lord
their
God
continually
,
insotuch
that
the
Lord
did
bless
them
,
according
to
his
word
,
so
hat
they
did
wax
strong
,
and
prosper
in
the
land
.
And
it
tame
to
pass
that
all
these
things
were
done
.
.
And
Helaman
fied
,
in
the
thirty
and
fifth
year
ofthe
reign
of

ter
the
people
of
Nephi
.
CHAPTER
XXX

_Ayn
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
thirty
and
txth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
that
Shiblon
took
possession
of
those
sacred
things
which
had
Hn
delivered
unto
Telaman
by
Alma
;
and
he
was
a
just
man
and
he
did
walk
uprightly
before
God
;
aud
he
did
obste
to
do
good
continually
,
to
keep
the
commandments
of
eLord
his
God
;
and
also
did
his
brother
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
diced
also
.
And
thus
enel
the
thirty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
J
udges
.
And
me
(
o
pass
that
in
the
thirty
and
seventh
year
of
the
reign
the
Judges
,
there
was
a
large
company
of
men
,
even
to
the
ount
of
five
thousand
and
four
hundred
men
,
with
their
bs
kh
[File:410]
wives
and
thejr
children
,
departed
out
of
the
land
of
Zam
.
hemla
,
into
the
Iand
which
was
northward
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Hagoth
,
he
being
an
—
rious
man
,
thercfore
he
went
forth
and
built
him
an
exceeding
large
ship
,
on
the
borders
of
the
land
Bountiful
,
by
the
lan}
Desolation
,
and
launched
it
forth
into
the
West
Sca
,
by
th
narrow
neck
which
led
into
the
land
northward
.
And
behold
,
there
were
many
of
the
Nephites
which
did
enter
therein
,
aug
did
sail
forth
with
much
provisions
,
and
also
many
womye
and
children
;
and
they
took
their
course
northward
,
Ani
thus
ended
the
thirty
and
seventh
year
.
And
in
the
thirty
and
cighth
year
,
this
man
built
other
ships
.
And
the
first
ship
did
also
return
,
and
many
more
people
did
enter
into
it
;
and
thes
also
took
much
provisions
,
and
set
out
again
to
the
lid
northward
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
never
heard
of
more
—
And
we
suppose
that
they
were
drowned
up
in
the
depths
af
the
sea
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
one
other
ship
also
did
sal
forth
;
and
whither
she
did
go
,
we
know
not
.
And
if
came
to
pass
that
in
this
year
,
there
were
many
people
which
went
forth
into
the
land
northward
.
And
thus
ended
the
thirty
and
eighth
year
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
,
Shiblon
died
also
,
and
Corianton
had
gov
forth
to
the
land
northward
,
in
a
ship
,
to
carry
forth
provie
ions
unto
the
people
which
had
gone
forth
into
that
lent
;
therefore
it
became
expedient
for
Shiblon
to
confer
those
cred
things
,
before
his
death
,
upon
the
son
of
Helaman
,
who
was
called
[elaman
,
being
called
after
the
name
of
his
father
Now
behold
,
ail
those
engravings
which
were
in
the
possess
of
Helaman
,
were
written
and
sent
forth
among
the
chili
of
men
throughout
all
the
land
,
save
it
were
those
parts
which
lad
been
commanded
by
Alma
should
not
go
forth
.
Never
theless
these
things
were
to
be
kept
sacred
,
and
handed
dom
from
one
generation
to
another
;
therefore
,
in
this
year
,
the
had
been
conferred
upon
Helaman
,
before
the
death
of
Shil
lon
.
And
it
eame
to
pass
also
in
this
year
,
that
there
wet
some
dissenters
which
had
gone
forth
unto
the
Lamanites
;
aml
they
were
stirred
up
again
to
anger
against
the
Nephites
.
Aol
also
in
this

year
,
they
came
down
with
a
numerous
anf
to
war
against

against

~
Axp
now
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
forticth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
©
Nephi
,
there
began
to
be
a
serious
difficulty
among
the
people
ofthe
Nephites
.
For
behold
,
Paboran
had
died
,
and
gone
the
way
of
all
the
earth
;
therefore
there
began
to
be
a
serious
contention
concerning
who
should
have
the
judgement
seat
imong
the
brethren
,
which
were
the
sons
of
Pahoran
.
Now
these
are
their
names
which
did
contend
for
the
judgement
seat
,
which
did
also
cause
the
people
to
contend
:
Pahoran
,
Faanchi
,
and
Pacumeni
.
Now
these
are
not
all
the
sons
of
Pahoran
,
(
for
he
had
many
,)
but
these
are
they
which
did
contend
for
the
judgement
seat
;
therefore
they
did
cause
three
divisions
among
the
people
.
Nevertheless
,
it
came
to
pass
that
Pahoran
was
appointed
by
the
voice
of
the
people
to
be
aChief
Judge
and
a
governor
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Pacumeni
,
when
he
saw
that
he
could
not
obtain
the
judgement
seat
,
he
did
unite
with
the
Yoiee
of
the
people
.
But
behold
,
Paanchi
,
and
that
part
of
the
people
that
were
desirous
that
he
should
be
their
governor
,
exceeding
wroth
;
therefore
he
was
about
to
flatter
away
se
people
to
rise
up
in
rebellion
against
their
brethren
,
[File:412]
And
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
about
to
do
this
,
behold
,
be
Was
taken
,
and
was
tried
according
to
the
voice
of
the
people
,
and
condemped
unto
death
;
for
he
had
raised
up
in
rebeltion
,
and
sought
to
destroy
the
liberty
of
the
people
.
.
Now
whey
those
people
which
were
desirous
that
he
should
be
their
gov
ernor
,
saw
that
he
was
condemned
unto
death
,
therefore
they
were
angry
;
and
hehold
,
they
sent
forth
one
Kishkumen
,
even
to
the
judgement
seat
of
Pahoran
,
and
murdered
Pahoran
as
le
sat
upon
the
judgement
seat
.
And
he
was
pursued
by
the
servants
of
Pahoran
;
but
behold
,
so
speedy
was
the
flight
of
Kishkumen
,
that
no
man
could
overtake
him
.
And
he
went
unto
those
that
sent
him
,
and
they
all
entercd
into
a
covenant
,
yea
,
swearing
by
their
everlasting
Maker
,
that
they
would
tel
)
no
man
that
Kishkumen
had
murdered
Pahoran
;
therefor
:
Kishkumen
was
uot
known
among
the
people
of
Nephi
,
forke
was
in
disguise
at
the
time
that
he
murdered
Pahoran
.
And
Kishkumen
,
and
his
bang
which
had
covenanted
with
him
,
did
mingle
themselves
among
the
people
,
in
a
manner
that
they
all
could
not
be
found
;
but
as
many
as
were
found
,
were
com
demned
unto
death
.
And
now
behold
,
Pacumeni
was
appoint
:
ed
,
according
to
the
voice
-
of
the
people
,
to
be
a
Chief
Judy
.
and
a
govereor
over
the
people
,
to
reign
in
the
stead
of
his
brother
Pahoran
;
and
it
-
was
according
to
his
right
.
And
dl
this
was
done
,
in
the
fortieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
;
and
it
had
an
end
,
mm
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
forty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
,
that
the
Lamanites
had
gathered
together
a
innumerable
army
of
men
,
and
armed
them
with
swords
,
and
with
cimeters
,
and
with
bows
,
and
with
arrows
,
and
with
heat
plates
,
and
with
breast
-
plates
,
and
with
all
manner
of
shielis
of
every
kind
;
and
they
came
down
again
,
that
they
might
piteh
battle
against
the
Nephites
.
And
they
were
led
by
a
mm
whose
name
was
.
Coriantumr
;-
and
he
was
a
descendant
Zarahemla
;
and
he
wasa
dissenter
from
among
the
Nephites
:
and
he
was
a
large
and
a
mighty
man
;
therefore
the
king
af
the
Lamanites
,
whose
name
waa
Tubaloth
,
who
was
the
sot
of
Ammoron
.
Now
Tubsloth
supposing
that
Coriantumr
,
be
being
a
mighty
man
,
could
stand
against
the
Nephites
,
ins
mach
with
his
strength
,
and
also
with
his
great
wisdom
,
thal
by
sending
him
forth
,
he
should
gain
power
oyer
the
Ne
phites
;
therefore
he
did
stir
them
up
to
anger
,
and
he
did
gather
together
his
armies
,
and
he
did
appoint

Jeader
,
and
did
cause
that
they
should
march
down
othe
land
of
Zarahemila
,
to
batile
against
the
Nephites
.
And
it
came
(
o
pass
that
because
of
so
much
contention
md
so
much
difficulty
in
the
government
,
that
they
had
not
kept
sufficient
guards
in
the
Jand
of
Zarahemla
;
for
they
had
supposed
that
the
Lamanites
durst
not
come
into
the
heart
of
ther
Jands
to
attack
that
great
city
Zarahemla
,
But
it
came
iopass
that
Coriantumy
did
march
forth
at
the
head
of
his
sumerous
host
,
and
came
upon
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
,
and
their
march
was
with
such
exceeding
great
speed
,
that
there
mas
no
time
for
the
Nephites
to
gather
together
their
armies
;
derefore
Coriantumr
did
ent
down
.
the
wateh
by
the
entrance
athe
city
,
and
did
march
forth
with
kis
whole
army
into
the
aly
,
and
they
did
slay
every
one
who
did
oppose
them
,
insoquch
that
they
did
take
possession
of
the

And
it
eae
to
pass
that
Pacumeni
,
which
was
the
Chief
Judge
,
did
ice
before
Coriantamr
,
even
io
the
walls
of
the
city
.
.
And
it
aneto
pass
that
Coriantumr
did
smiie
him
against
the
wall
,
asomuch
that
he
died
.
And
thus
ended
the
days
of
Pacumea
,
And
now
when
Coriantumr
saw
that
he
was
in
possessmofthe
city
of
Zarahemla
,
and
saw
that
the
Nephites
had
fed
before
ihem
,
and
were
slain
,
and
were
taken
,
and
were
astinto
prison
,
and
that
he
had
obtained
the
possess
ion
of
lestrongest
hold
in
all
the
land
,
his
heart
took
courage
,
insomich
ihat
he
was
about
to
go
forth
against
allthe
land
.
And
jwhe
did
not
tarry
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
but
he
did
warch
forth
with
a
large
army
,
even
towards
the
city
of
Bounlil
;
for
it
was
his
determination
to
go
forth
and
cut
his
way
hough
with
the
sword
,
that
he
might
obtain
the
north
parts
.
ilike
land
;
and
supposing
that
their
greatest
strength
was
in
lecentre
of
the
land
,
therefore
he
did
march
forth
,
giving
hem'
no
time
to
assemble
themselves
together
,
save
.
it
were
small
bodies
;
and
in
this
manner
they
did
fall
upon
them
ideut
them
down
to
the
earth
.
But
behold
,
this
march
of
Corantumr
through
the
centre
of
the
land
,
gave
Moronihah
seat
advantage
over
them
,
notwithstanding
the
greatness
of
ihe
number
of
the
Nephites
which
were
slain
.
for
behold
,
oronihah
had
supposed
that
the
Lamanites
:
nol
come
lito
the
centre
of
the
land
;
but
that
they
would
attack'
the
cilisstound
about
in
.
the
borders
,
as
they
had
hitherto
done
;
erefore
Moronihah
had
caused
that
their
strong
armies
id
maintain
those
parts
round
about
by
the
borders
.
But
bold
,
the
Lamaniles
were
not
frightened
according
to
his
de
[File:414]
sire
,
but
they
had
come
into
the
centre
of
the
land
,
and
hai
taken
the
capital
city
,
which
was
the
city
of
Zarahemla
,
ay
were
marching
through
the
most
capital
parts
of
the
land
,
sly
,
ing
the
-
people
witha
great
slaughter
,
both
men
,
women
children
,
taking
possession
of
many
cities
and
of
many
holds
.
But
when
Movonihah
had
discovered
this
,
he
imme
),
ately
sent
forth
Lehi
with
an
army
round
about
to
head
before
they
should
come
to
the
land
Bountiful
:
And
thus
)
did
;
”
and
he
did
head
them
,
before
they
came
to
the
lal
Bountiful
,
and
gave
unto
them
battle
,
insomuch
that
began
to
retreat
back
towards
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroniheh
did
head
them
in
their
retry
and
did
give
unto
them
battle
insomuch
that
it
became
ane
veeding
bloody
battle
;
yea
,
many
were
slain
;
and
among
ix
number
which
were
slain
,
Coriantumr
was
also
found
.
i
now
behold
the
Lamanites
could
not
retreat
neither
way
,
neither
on
the
north
,
nor
on
the
south
,
nor
on
the
east
,
nore
the
west
,
for
they
were
surrounded
on
every
hand
by
the
Ne
phites
:
And
thus
had
Coriantumr
planged
the
Lamanitesis
to
the
midst
of
the
Nephites
,
insomuch
that
they
were
ini
power
of
the
Nephites
,
and
he
himself
was
slain
,
and
ik
ee
did
yield
themsclves
into
the
hands
of
the
le
phites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moronihah
took
possession
afte
city
of
Zavahemla
again
,
and
caused
that
the
Lamanites
whi
had
been
taken
prisoners
should
depart
out
of
the
land
a
peace
.
And
thus
ended
the
forty
and
first
year
of
the
ren
of
the
Judges
.
on
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
forty
and
second
year
offi
reign
of
the
Judges
,
afler
Moronihah
had
established
agein
i
peace
betweem
the
Nephites
and
the
Lamanites
,
behold
thet
was
no
one
to
fill
the
judgement
seat
;
therefore
there
heat
to
bea
contention
.
again
among
the
people
concerning
WH
should
fill
the
judgement
seat
.
And
it
,
came
to
pass
that
He
Jaman
,
which
was
the
son
of
Helaman
,
was
appointed
tof
the
judegment
seat
,
by
the
voice
of
the
people
;
but
behold
,
hist
kumen
,
who
had
murdered
Pahoran
,
did
lay
wait
10
dest
Helaman
also
;
and
he
was
upheld
by
bis
band
,
which
hade
tered
into
a
covenant
that
no
one
should
know
his
wickednes
)
for
there
was
one
Gadianton
,
who
was
exceeding
expetl
many
words
,
and
also
in
his
craft
,
to
carry
on
the
secret
of
murder
and
of
robbery
;
therefore
he
became
the
lead
the
band
of
Kishkumen
;
therefore
he
did
flatter
them
,
i
[File:415]
tlso
Kishkumen
,
that
if
they
would
place
him
in
the
judgement
seat
,
he
would
grant
unto
those
which
belonged
to
his
tand
that
they
should
be
placed
in
power
and
authority
among
the
people
;
therefore
Kishkumen
sought
to
destroy
Helaan
5
And
it
came
to
pass
as
he
went
orth
towards
the
judgement
seat
,
to
destroy
[elaman
,
behold
one
of
the
servants
of
Helaman
,
having
been
out
by
night
,
and
having
obtained
,
through
disguise
,
a
knowledge
of
those
plans
which
had
been
laid
by
this
band
to
destroy
Helaman
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
met
Kishkumen
,
and
he
gave
unto
him
a
sign
;
therefore
Kishkumen
made
known
unto
him
the
object
of
his
desire
,
desiring
that
he
would
conduct
him
to
the
judgement
seat
,
that
he
might
murder
Helaman
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
servant
of
Helaman
had
known
all
the'
heart
of
Kistkumen
,
and
how
that
it
was
his
object
to
murder
,
and
alsihat
it
was
the
object
of
all
those
which
belonged
to
his
band
,
murder
,
and
to
rob
,
and
to
gain
power
,
(
and
this
was
their
secret
plan
,
and
their
combination
,)
the
servant
of
Telaman
sith
unto
Kishkumen
,
Let
us
go
forth
unto
the
judgement
seat
.
Now
this
did
please
Kishkumen
exceedingly
,
for
he
did
suppoe
that
he
should
accomplish
his
design
;
but
behold
,
the
wrvant
of
Helaman
,
as
they
were
going
forth
unto
the
judgement
seat
,
did
stab
Kishkumen
,
even
to
the
heart
,
that
he
fell
deat
without
a
groan
.
And
he
ran
and
told
Helaman
all
the
things
which
he
had
seen
,
and
heard
,
and
done
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Helaman
did
send
forth
to
take
this
land
of
robbers
and
secret
murderers
,
that
they
might
be
tkeeuted
according
to
the
law
.
But
behold
,
when
Gadianton
tad
found
that
Kishkumen
did
not
return
,
he
feared
lest
that
he
should
be
destroyed
;
therefore
he
caused
that
his
band
should
follow
him
.
And
they
took
their
flight
out
of
the
land
,
by
a
secret
way
,
into
the
wilderness
;
and
thus
when
Helalm
sent
forth
fo
take
them
,
they
could
no
where
be
found
.—
more
of
this
Gadianton
shall
be
spoken
hereafter
.
And
tlus
ended
the
forty
and
second
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judg®over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
behold
,
in
the
end
of
this
book
,
ye
shall
see
that
this
Gadianton
did
prove
the
overthrow
,
i
almost
the
entire
destruction
of

people
of

a
Anp
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
forty
and
third
year
afi
,
reign
of
the
Judges
,
there
was
no
contention
among
the
peg
of
Nephi
,
save
it
were
a
little
pride
which
was
in
the
chung
which
did
-
cause
some
little
dissensions
among
the
peng
which
afiairs
were
settled
in
the
ending
of
the
forty
and
year
.
And
there
was
no
contention
among
the
pcople
in
forty
and
fourth
year
;
neither
was
there
much
conteniionjy
the
forty
and
fifth
year
.
And
it
-
came
to
pass
in
the
forty
aj
sixth
,
yea
,
there
were
much
contentions
and
many
dissensig
:
inthe
which
there
were
an
exceeding
great
many
which
e
parted
out
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
went
forth
unto
ty
land
northward
,
to
inherit
the
land
;
and
they
did
travel
tow
excceding
great
distance
,
insomuch
that
they
came
to
leg
bodies
of
water
,
and
many
rivers
;
yea
,
and
even
these
spread
forth
into
all
parts
of
the
land
,
into
whatever
paris
)
had
not
-
been
rendered
desolate
,
and
without
timber
,
becau
:
of
the
many
inhabitants
which
had
before
inherited
the
lat
And
now
no
part
of
the
land
was
desolate
,
save
it
were
fn
timber
,
&c
.;
but
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
destructie
of
the
people
which
had
before
inhabited
the
land
,
it
ww
called
desolate
.
And
there
being
but
little
timber
upon
te
face
-
of
the
land
,
nevertheless
the
people
which
went
forth
,
ie
came
exceeding
expert
in
the
working
of
cement
;
therelit
they
did
build
houses
of
cement
,
in
the
which
they
did
dwell
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
multiply
and
spread
,
al
did
go
forth
from
the
land
southward
,
1o
the
land
northwat
and
did
spread
insomuch
that
they
began
to
cover
the
facedl
the
whole
earth
,
from
the
sea
south
,
to
the
sea
north
,
from
lt
sea
west
,
to
the
sea
east
.
And
the
people
which
were
inl
land
northward
,
did
dwell
in
tents
,
and
in
houses
of
cemell
,
and
they
did
suffer
whatsoever
tree
should
spring
up
upon
iit
faee
of
the
land
,
that
it
should
grow
up
,
that
in
time
the
might
have
timber
to
build
their
houses
,
yea
,
their
cities
,
a
their
temples
,
and
their
synagogues
,
and
their
sanctuatitt
and
ail
manner
of
their
buildings
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
as
timber
was
exceeding
scarce
in
tlt
land
northward
,
they
did
send
forth
much
by
the
way
of
shit
ping
;
and
thus
they
did
enable
the
people
in
the
land
not
ward
,
that
they
might
build
many
cities
,
both
of
weod
and
cement
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
of
[File:417]
ple
of
Ammon
,
which
were
Lamanites
by
birth
,
did
also
og
forth
into
this
land
.
Aud
now
there
are
many
records
kept
of
the
proceedings
ofthis
people
,
by
many
of
this
people
,
which
are
particular
and
yery
large
,
concerning
them
;
but
behold
a
hundredth
part
athe
proceedings
of
this
people
,
yea
,
the
account
of
the
Las
sianites
,
and
of
the
Nephites
,
and
their

,
and

and
their
plundering
,
and
all
manner
of
dominations
and
whoredoms
,
cannot
be
contained
in
this
pork
;
but
behold
,
there
are
many
books
and
many
records
of
wey
kind
,
and
they
have
been
kept
chiefly
by
the
Nephites
;
ad
they
have
becn
handed
down
{rom
one
generation
to
anier
,
by
the
Nephites
,
even
until
they
have
fallen
into
trans

,
and
have
been
murdered
,
plundered
,
and
hunted
,
and
iiven
forth
,
and
slain
,
and
scattered
upon

and
mixed
with
the
Lamanites
until
they
are
no
more
alled
the
Nepbites
,
becoming
wicked
,
and
wild
,
and
ferocious
,
j@
,
even
becoming
Lamanites
.
And
now
[return
again
to
mine
account
;
therefore
what
I
love
spoken
had
passed
afier
there
had
been
great
conteniowa
,
and
disturbances
,
and
wars
,
and
dissensions
among
the
wople
of
Nephi
.
The
forly
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
ltdges
ended
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
still
great
witentions
in
the
land
,
yea
,
even
in
the
forty
and
seventh
year
,
and
also
in
the
forty
and
eighth
year
;
nevertheless
,
Hefinan
did
fill
the
judgement
seat
with
justice
and
equity
;
yea
,
fdid
observe
to
keep
the
statutes
,
and
the
judgements
,
and
he
commandments
of
God
;
and
he
did
do
that
which
was
ht
in
the
sight
of
God
,
continually
;
and
he
did
walk
after
the
ways
,
of
his
father
,
insomuch
that
he
did
prosper
in
the
ind
,
And
itcame
to
pass
that
he
had
two
sons
.
He
gave
Wo
the
eldest
the
name
of
Nephi
,
and
unto
the
youngest
the
tame
of
Lehi
.
And
they
began
to
grow
up
unto
the
Lord
.—
And
it
came
to
pass
tliat
the
wars
and
contentions
began
to
a
,
ina
small
degree
,
among
the
people
of
the
Nephites
,
the
latter
end
of
the
forty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
fe
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
it
came
to
pass
the
forty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
,
there
%S
continual
peace
established
in
the
land
,.
all
save
it
were
.
[File:418]
the
secret
combinations
which
Gadianton
the
nobler
had
tablished
,
in
the
more
settled
parts
of
the
land
,
which
at
tha
:
time
were
not
known
unto
those
which
were
at
the
head
ai
government
;
therefore
they
were
not
destroyed
out
of
the
Jan
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
same
year
,
there
Was
ep
ceeding
great
prosperity
in
the
chureb
,
insomuch
:
that
ther
were
thousands
who
did
join
themselves
unto
the
church
,
ani
were
baptized
unto
repentance
;
and
so
great
was
the
phos
perity
of
the
church
,
and
so
many
the
blessings
which
wy
poured
out
upon
the
people
,
that
even
the
High
Priests
ay
the
teachers
were
themselves
astonished
beyond
measure
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
work
of
the
Lord
did
prospey
,
unto
the
baptizing
and
uniting
to
the
church
of
God
map
souls
;
yea
,
even
tens
of
thousands
.
Thus
we
may
see
te
the
Lord
is
merciful
unto
all
who
will
,
in
the
sincerity
of
they
hearts
,
call
upon
his
holy
name
;
yea
,
thus
we
see
that
te
gate
of
Heaven
is
open
unto
all
,
even
to
those
who
will
blew
onthe
name
of
Jesus

were
the
pride
which
began
to
enter
into

not
into

,
but
into
the
hearlsd
the
people
who
professed
to
belong
to

of

:
and
they
were
lilted
up
in
pride
,
even
to

Now

yea

even
jothe
purifying
and
the
sanctification
of
their
hearts
,
which
sanctification
cometh
because
of
their
yielding
their
hearts
unto
God
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
fifty
and
second
year
aded
in
peace
also
,
save
it
were
the
exceeding
great
pride
which
had
got
inte
the
hearts
of
the
people
;
and
it
was
beause
of
their
exceeding
great
riches
,
and
their
prosperity
in
heJand
;
and
it
did
grow
upon
them
from
day
to
day
.
And
it
came
to
pass
,
in
the
fifty
and
third
year
of
the
reign
dthe
Judges
,
Helaman
died
,
and
his
eldest
son
Nephi
began
wreignin

.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
fill
the
jmgement

with
justice
and
equity
;
yea
,
he
did
keep
the
omaandments
of
God
,
and
did
walk
inthe
ways
of
his
fa

.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fifty
and
fourth
year
,
there
yee
many
dissensions
in
the
church
,
and
there
was
also
9
wnlention
among
the
people
,
insomuch
that
there
was
much
toodshed
;
and
the
rebcllious
part
were
slain
and
driven
out
ithe
land
,
and
they
did
go
unto
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
endeavor
to
stir
up
the
lamanites
to
war
against
the
Nephites
;
but
behold
,
the
Launites
were
excecding
fraid
,
insomuch
that
they
would
not
lerken
to
the
words
of
those
dissenters
.
But
it
came
to

athe
fifty

of

,
there

went
up
from

Lanani
and
they
succeeded
with
those
others
in
stirring
lim
up
to
anger
against
the
Nephites
;
and
they
were
all
that
jar
preparing
for
war
.
And
in
the
fifty
and
sevenih
year
,
ieydid
come
down
against
the
Nephites
to
battle
,
and
they
(
icommence
the
work
of

;
yea
,
insomuch
,
that
in

,
they
sueceedum

was

and
the
Nephites
,
and
the
armies
of
Moronihah
,
tee
driven
even
into

;
and
there
they

from

it

on

Atwhich
they
had

And
thus
those
dissenters
of
the

,
with
the
help
of
a
numerous
army
of
the
Lamanites
,
Hd
obtained
all
the

And
all
this
was
done
in

fifty

of

And
it
came
to

in

sixty

first
year
of
the
,
of
the
Judges
,
they
succeeded
in
retaining
even

Now
this

of

Nephites
,
the
great
slaughter
which
was

would
not

,
had
it

for

yea
,
and
it
was
among
also
which
professed

ani
:
was
because
of

because

because

great
wid
edness
,
and
their

in

they
wer
jeft
in

they

until

Bi
,
behold
,
Moronihah
did
preach
many

unto

also
Nephi

it
came

they

and
inasmach
as
they
did

,
they
didle
gin
to

;
for
when
Moronihah
saw
that
they
did
pent
,
he
did
venture
to
lead
them
forth
from
place
to
ple
and
from

even
until
they
had
retained
the
anelil
of

and
the
one
half
of
all

,
And
tie
ended
the
sixty

of

And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
sixty
and
second
year
of
!
reign
of
the
Judges
,
that
Moronibah
could
obtain
no
morep®
sessions
over
the
Lamanites
;
therefore
they
did
abandon
i®
design
to
obtain
the
remainder
of

lands
,
for
so
nunem
was
the
Lamanites
that
it
became
impossible
for
the
Nephite
to
obtain
more
power
over
them
;
therefore
Moronihal
employ
all
his
armics
in
maintaining
those
parts
which
be
taken
,
.
e
[File:421]
And
it
came
to
pass
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
number
at
the
Lamanites
,
the
Nephites
were
m
great
fear
,
Jest
they
should
be
overpowered
,
and
trodden
down
,
and
slain
,
and
desroyed
;
yea
,
they
began
to
remember
the
prophecies
of
Alina
,
and
also
the
words
of
Mosiah
;
and
they
saw
that
they
had
heen
a
stiffnecked
people
,
and
that
they
had
set
at
nought
the
commandments
of
God
;
and
that
they
had
altered
and
trampled
under
their
feet
the
laws
of
Mosiah
,
or
that
which
the
Lord
commanded
him
to
give
unto
the
people
;
and
thus
seeing
that
their
laws
had
become
corrupted
,
and
that
they
had
become
a
wicked
people
,
insomuch
that
they
were
wicked
eyen
like
unto
the
Lamanites
.
And
because
of
their
iniquity
,
the
church
had
began
to
dwindle
;
and
they
began
to
disbelieve
inthe
spirit
of
prophecy
,
and
in
the
spirit
of
revelation
;
and
the
judgements
of
God
did
stare
them
in
the
face
.
And
they
saw
that
they
had
become
weak
,
like
unto
their
brethren
,
the
Jamanites
,
and
that
the
spirit
of
the
Yuord
did
no
more
preserve
them
;
yea
,
it
had
withdrawn
from
them
,
because
the
spit
of
the
Lord
doth
not
dwell
in
unholy
temples
;
therefore
the
Lord
did
cease
to
preserve
them
by
his
miraculous
and
matchless
power
,
for
they
had
fallen
inte
a
state
of
unbelief
and
awful
wickedness
;
and
they
saw
that
the
Lamanites
were
more
exceeding
numerous
tian
they
,
and
except
they
should
cleave
unto
the
Lord
their
God
,
they
must
unavoidably
perish
,
For
behold
,
they
saw
that
the
strength
of
the
Lamanites
was
as
great
as
their
strength
,
even
man
for
man
.
And
thus
had
they
fallen
into
this
great
transgression
;
yea
,
thus
liad
they
become
weak
,
hecause
of
their
transgression
,
in
the
space
of
not
many
years
.
,
And
jt
came
to
pass
that
in
this
same
year
,
behold
,
Nephi
delivered
up
the
judgement
seat
,
te
a
man
whose
name
was
Cezoram
.
For
as
their
laws
and
their
governments
were
established
by
the
voice
of
the
people
,
and
they
which
chose
evil
were
more
numerous
than
they
which
chose
good
,
therefae
they
were
ripening
for
destruction
,
for
the
laws
had
hecome
corrupted
;
yea
,
and
this
was
not
all
;
they
were
a
stiff
tteked
people
,
insomuch
that
they
could
not
be
governed
by
the
law
nor
justice
,
save
it
were
to
their
destruction
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
had
become
weary
,
because
Of
the'
iniquity
;
aud
he
yielded
up
the
j
ment

,
and
0k

woen
him
to

of

all
the

and
bis
brother
Lehi
also
,
all
the
remainder
of
his
y
they
remembered
the
words
which
their
father
He
ax
.
[File:422]
Jaman
spake
unto
them
.
And
these
are
the
words
which
he
spake
:
Behold
,
my
sons
,
[desire
that
ye
should
remember
to
keep
the
commandments
of
God
;
and
I
would
that
ye
should
declare
unto
the
people
these
words
:
Behold
,
Ihave
given
up
.
to
you
the
names
of
our
first
parents
,
which
came
out
of
the
and
of
Jerusalem
;
and
this
IT
have
done
,
that
when
you
ze
.
member
your
names
,
that
ye
may
remember
ther
;
and
whe
ye
remember
them
,
ye
may
remember
their
works
;
and
when
ye
remember
their
works
,
ye
may
know
how
that
it
is
said
,
and
also
written
,
that
they
were
good
;
therefore
,
my
sons
,
would
that
ye
should
do
that
which
is
good
,
that
it
may
be
said
of
you
,
and
aJso
written
,
even
as
it
has
been
said
and
written
of
them
.
And
now
my
sons
,
behold
,
I
have
somewhat
more
to
desire
of
you
,
which
desire
is
,
that
ye
may
not
dp
these
things
that
ye
may
boast
,
but
that
ye
may
do
these
things
to
lay
up
for
yourselves
a
treasure
in
Heaven
,
yea
,
which
is
-
eternal
,
and
which
fadeth
not
away
;
yea
,
that
ye
may
have
that
precious
gift
of
eternal
life
,
which
we
have
reason
to
sup
pose
hath
been
given
to
our
fathers
,
O
remember
,
remember
,
my
sons
,
the
words
which
king
Benjamin
spake
unto
his
people
;
yex
,
remember
that
theres
no
other
way
nor
means
whereby
man
can
be
saved
,
only
through
the
atoning
blood
of
Jesus
Christ
,
which
shall
come
;
yea
,
remember
that
he
cometh
to
redeem
the
world
.
Andre
member
also
,
the
words
which
Amulek
spake
unto
Zeezrom
,
in
the
city
of
Ammonihiah
:
for
he
said
unto
bim
,
That
the
Lord
surely
should
come
to
redeem
his
people
;
but
that
he
should
not
come
to
redeem
them
in
their
sins
,
but
to
redeem
_
them
from
their
sims
.
And
he
hath
power
given
.
unto
him
=
from
the
Father
,
to
redeem
them
from
their
sins
,
because
of
;
~
repentance
;
therefore
he
hath
sent
his
angels
to
declare
the
tidings
of
the
conditions
of
repentance
,
which
bringeth
un
thepower
of
the
Redemer
,
unto
the
salvation
of
their
souls
—
And
now
,
my
sons
,
remember
,
remember
that
it
is
upon
the
rork
of
our
Redeemer
,
which
is
Christ
,
the
Son
of
God
,
thit
,
ye
must
build
your
foundation
,
that
when
the
Devil
shall
send
i
:
forth
his
mighty
winds
;
yea
,
his
shafis
in
the
whirlwind
;
yee
when
all
his
hail
and
his
mighty
storm
shall
beat
upon
you
,
#
shall
have
no
power
over
you
,
to
drag
you
down
to
the
gulfd
misery
and
endless
wo
,
because
of
the
rack
upon
which
year
built
,
which
is
a
sure
foundation
,
a
foundation
whereon
if
met
buildeth
,
they
cannot
fall
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
these
were
the
words
whi
[File:423]
man
taught
to
his
sons
;
yea
,
he
did
teach
them
many
things
witich
are
not
written
,
and
also
many
things
which
are
written
.
And
they
did
remember
his
words
;
end
therefore
they
went
forth
,
keeping
the
commandments
of
God
,
to
teach
the
word
of
God
among
all
the
people
of
Nephi
,
beginning
at
the
city
Bountiful
;
and
fron
thence
forth
to
the
city
of
Gid
;
and
from
the
city
of
Gid
to
the
city
of
Mulck
;
and
even
from
one
city
to
another
,
untl
they
had
gone
forth
among
all
the
people
of
Nephi
,
which
were
in
the
Jand
southward
;
and
from
thence
into
the
lund
of
Zarahemla
,
among
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
preach
with
great
power
,
insomuch
that
they
did
confound
many
of
those
dissenters
which
had
gone
over
from
the
Nephites
,
insomuch
that
they
came
forth
and
did
confess
their
sins
,
and
were
baptized
unto
repentance
,
and
immediately
returned
to
the
Nephites
,
to
endeavor
to
repair
unto
them
the
wrongs
which
they
had
done
.
And
it
came
to
pass
.
that
Nephi
and
Lehi
did
preach
unto
the
.
Lamanites
with
such
great
power
and
authority
:
for
they
had
power
and
authority
given
unto
them
that
they
might
speak
;
and
they
also
had
what
they
should
speak
,
given
unto
them
;
therefore
they
did
speak
unto
the
great
astonishment
of
the
Lamanites
,
to
the
convincing
them
,
insomuch
that
there
were
eiglit
thousand
of
the
Jamanites

and
round
absut
,
baptized
unto
repentance
,
and
were
convinced
of
the
wickedness
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
,
yy
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
and
Lehi
did
proceed
from
thenee
to
go
to
the
land
of
Nephi
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
taker
by
an
army
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
cast
into
.
.
”
prison
;
yea
,
even
in
that
same
prison
in
which
Ammon
and
his
brethren
were
cast
by
the
servants
of
Limhi
.
And
after
theyhad
been
cast
into
prison
many
days
without
food
,
behold
,
they
went
forth
into
the
prison
to
take
them
,
that
they
might
slay
them
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
and
Lehi
were
neircled
about
as
if
by
fire
,
even
insomuch
that
they
durst
not
lay
their
-
hands
upon
them
for
fear
,
lest
they
should
be
burned
,
Nevertheless
,
Nephi
and
Lehi
were
not
burned
;
and
they
were
as
standing
in
the
midst
of
fire
,
and
were
not
burned
.
And

When

and
that
it
burned
them
not
,
their
hearts
did
take
courage
.
w
they
saw
that
the
Lamanites
durst
not
lay
their
hands
u
™
them
;
neither
durst
.
they
come
near
unto
them
,
but
stood
wif
they
were
struck
dumb
with
amazement
.
[File:424]
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
and
Lehi
did
stand
forth
,
and
began
to
speak
unto
them
,
saying
:
Fear
not
,
for
behold
,
it
is
God
that
hath
shewn
unto
you
this
marvelous
thing
,
im
the
which
is
shewn
unto
you
,
that
ye
cannot
Jay
your
hands
onus
toslay
us
.
And
behold
,
when
they
had
said
these
words
,
the
earth
shook
exceedingly
,
and
the
walls
of
the
prison
did
.
shake
,
as
if
they
were
about
to
tumble
fo
the
carth
;
but
be
hold
,
they
did
not
fall
.
And
behold
,
they
that
were
in
the
prison
,
were
Lamanites
,
and
Nephites
which
were
dissenters
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
:
they
were
overshadowed
with
a
cloud
of
darkness
,
and
an
awful
,
solemn
fear
came
upon
them
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
came
:
a
voice
,
as
if
it
were
above
the
cloud
of
darkness
,
saying
,
Repent
yc
,
repent
ye
,
and
seek
no
more
to
destroy
my
servants
which
[have
sent
unto
you
to
declare
good
tidings
.
And
it
came
to
pass
when
they
heard
this
voice
,
and
beheld
that
it
was
not
a
voice
of
thunder
;
neither
was
it
a
voice
of
a
great
tumultuous
noise
;
but
behold
,
it
was
a
still
voice
,
of
perfect
mildness
,
as
if
it
had
beeu
a
whisper
,
and
it
did
pierce
even
to
the
very
soul
.
And
notwithstanding
the
mildness
of
the
voice
,
behold
,
the
earth
shook
exceedingly
,
and
the
walls
of
the
prison
trembled
again
,
as
if
it
were
about
to
tumble
to
the
earth
;
and
behold
,
the
cloud
of
darkness
which
had
overshadowed
them
,
did
not
disperse
.
And
behold
,
the
voice
came
again
,
saying
:
Repent
ye
,
repent
ye
,
forthe
kingdom
of
Heaven
is
at
hand
;
and
seek
no
more
,
to
destroy
my
servants
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
earth
shook
again
,
and
the
walls
tret
bled
;
and
also
again
the
third
time
the
voice
came
,
and
did
peak
unto
them
marvellous
words
,
which
carmot
be
uttered
&
man
;
and
the
walls
did
tremble
again
,
and
the
earth
shook
as
if
it
were
about
to
divide
asunder
,
.
Aud
it
came
to
pass
that
the
T
.
amanites
could
not
flee
,
be
cause
of
the
cloud
of
darkness
which
did
overshadow
them
;
yea
,
andydlso
they
were
immovable
,
hecause
of
the
fear
which
did
come
upon
them
.
Now
there
was
one
among
them
who
was
a
Nephite
by
birth
,
who
had
once
belonged
to
the
ehutch
of
God
,
but
had
dissented
:
from
them
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
tarned
him
about
,
and
behold
,
he
say
through
the
®
cloud
of
darkness
the
faces
of
Nephi
and
Lehi
;
and
behold
,
they
did
shine
exceedingly
,
even
as
the
face
of
angels
.
And
he
beheld
ihat
they
did
lift
their
eyes
to
Heaven
;
and
they
were
in
the
attitude
as
if
talking
erlifting
their
voices
to
some
being
which
they
beheld
.
F
[File:425]
And
if
came
to
pass
that
this
man
did
cry
unfo
the
multitude
,
(
hat
they
might
turn
and
look
.
And
beheld
,
there
was
power
given
unto
them
,
that
they
did
turn
and
look
;
and
they
did
behold
the
faces
ot
Nephi
and
Lehi
.
And
they
said
unto
the
man
,
Behold
,
what
doth
all
these
things
mean
?
and
who
is
it
with
whom
these
men
do
converse
?
Now
the
man's
name
was
Aminadab
.
And
Aminadab
saith
unto
them
,
They
do
converse
with
the
angels
of
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
said
)
unto
him
;
What
shallwe
do
,
that
this
cloud
of
darkness
may
be
removed
from
overshadowing
us
?
Aud
Aminadah
saith
unto
them
,
You
must
repeut
,
and
cry
unto
the
yoice
,
even
until
ye
shall
have
faith
in
Christ
,
which
was
taught
unto
you
by
Alma
,
and
Aninlek
,
and
by
Zeezrom
;
and
when
ye
shall
do
this
,
the
cloud
of
darkness
shall
be
remoyed
from
overshadowing
you
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
all
did
begin
to
cry
unto
the
voice
of
him
which
had
shook
the
carih
;
yea
,
they
did
ery
even
until
the
cloud
of
darkness
was
dispersed
.
And
it
came
topass
that
when
they
cast
their
eyes
about
,
and
saw
that
the
cloud
of
darkness
was
dispersed
from
overshadowing
them
,
and
behold
,
they
saw
that
they
were
encircled
about
,
yea
,
evezy
soul
,
by
a
pillar
of
fire
.
And
Nephi
and
Lehiwas
in
the
midst
of
them
;
yea
,
they
were
encircled
about
;
yea
,
they
were
as
if'in
the
midst
of
a
flaming
fire
,
yet
it
did
harm
them
not
,
neither
did
it
take
hold
upon
the
walls
of
the
prison
;
and
they
were
filled
with
that
joy
which
is
unspeakable
and
full
of
glory
.
And
behold
,
the
Holy
Spirit
of
God
did
come
down
trom
Heaven
,
and
did
enter
into
their
hearts
,
and
they
were
filled
as
if
with
fire
;
and
they
could
speak
forth
marvello
words
,
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
came
a
voice
unto
them
,
yea
,
—
pleasant
voice
,
as
if
it
were
a
whisper
,
saying
,
Peace
,
peace
be
unto
you
,
because
of
your
faith
in
my
well
beloved
,
which
was
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
.
And
now
when
they
heard
this
,
they
cast
up
their
eyes
as
if
to
behold
from
whence
the
voice
came
;
and
behold
,
they
saw
the
heavens
open
;
and
angels
came
down
out
of
heaven
,
and
ministered
unto
them
.—
And
there
were
about
three
hundred
souls
which
saw
and
heard
-
these
things
;
and
they
were
bid
to
go
forth
and
marvel
hot
,
neither
should
they
doubt
.
And
it
-
came
to
pass
that
they
4id
go
forth
;
and
did
.
minister
unto
the
people
,
declaring
throughout
all
the
regions
round
about
,
all
-
the
things
which
they
had
heard
and
seen
,
insomuch
that
the
more
part
of
the
[File:426]
Lamanites
were
convinced
of
them
,
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
evidencess
which
they
had
received
;
and
as
inany
as
were
convinced
,
did
lay
down
their
weapons
of
war
,
and
also
their
hatred
,
and
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
yield
up
unto
the
Nephites
,
the
lands
of
their
possession
.
'
And
it'came
to
pass
that
when
the
sixty
-
and
second
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
had
ended
,
all
these
things
had
happened
,
and
the
Lamanites
had
become
,
the
more
part
of
them
,
a
righteous
people
,
insomuch
that
their
righteousness
did
exceed
that
of
the
Nephites
,
because
of
their
firmness
,
and
their
steadiness
in
the
faith
.
For
behold
,
there
were
many
of
the
Nephites
which
had
become
hardened
,
and
impenitent
,
and
grossly
wicked
,
insomuch
that
they
did
reject
the
word
of
God
,
and
all
the
preaching
and
prophecying
which
did
come
among
them
.
Nevertheless
,
the
people
of
the
chureh
did
have
great
joy
,
because
of
the
conversion
of
the
Lamanites
;
yea
,
because
of
the
church
of
God
,
which
had
been
established
among
them
.
And
they
did
fellowship
one
with
another
,
and
did
rejoice
one
with
another
,
and
did
have
great
joy
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
many
of
the
Lamanites
did
come
down
into
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
did
declare
unto
the
people
of
the
Nephites
the
manner
of
their
conversion
,
and
did
exhort
them
to
faith
and
repentance
;
yea
,
and
many
did
preach
with
exceeding
great
power
and
authority
,
unto
the
bringing
down
many
of
them
into
the
depths
of
humility
,
to
be
the
haale
followers
of
God
and
the
Lamb
.
;
And
it
came
to
pass
that
many
of
the
Lamanites
did
go
into
the
land
northward
;
and
also
Nephi
and
Lehi
went
into
the
land
northward
,
to
preach
unto
the
people
.
And
thus
ended
the
sixty
and
third
year
.
And
behold
,
there
was
peace
in
all
the
land
,
insomuch
that
the
Nephites
did
go
into
whatsoever
part
of
the
land
they
would
,
whether
among
the
Nephites
or
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
alzo
go
whithersoever
they
would
,
whether
it
were
among
the
Lamanites
or
among
the
Nephites
;
and
thus
they
did
have
free
intercourse
one
with
another
,
for
to
bay
and
to
sell
,
and
to
get
gain
,
according
to
their
desire
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
became
exceeding
rich
,
both
the
Lamanites
and
the
Nephites
;
and
they
did
have
an
exceeding
plenty
ofgold
,
and
of
silver
,
and
of
all
manner
of
precious
metals
,
both
in
the
land
south
,
and
in
the
land
north
,
Now
the
land
south
was
called
Lehi
,
and
the
land
north
was
called
[File:427]
Mulek
,
which
was
after
the
sons
of
Zedekiah
;
for
the
Lord
did
bring
Mulek
into
the
Jand
north
,
and
Lehi
into
the
land
south
.
And
beliold
,
there
was
all
manner
of
gold
in
both
these
Jands
,
and
of
silver
,
and
of
precious
ore
of
every
kind
;
and
there
was
also
curious
workmen
,
which
did
work
all
kinds
of
ore
,
and
did
refine
it
;
and
thus
they
did
become
rich
.
They
did
raise
grain
in
abundance
,
both
in
the
north
and
in
the
south
;
and
they
did
flourish
exceedingly
,
both
in
the
north
and
in
the
south
.
And
they
did
multiply
and
wax
exceeding
strong
in
the
land
.
And
they
did
raise
many
flocks
and
herds
,
yea
,
many
fatlings
.
Behold
,
their
women
did
toil
and
spin
,
and
did
make
all
manner
of
cloth
,
of
fine
twined
linca
,
and
cloth
of
every
kind
,
to
clothe
their
nakedness
,
And
thus
the
sixty
and
fourth
year
did
pass
away
in
peace
.
And
in
the
sixty
and
filth
year
,
they
did
also
have
great
joy
and
peace
;
yea
,
much
preachiag
,
and
.
many
prophecies
concerning
that
which
was
to
come
.
And
thus
passed
away
the
sixty
and
fifth
year
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
sixty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
,
behold
,
Cezoram
was
murdered
by
an
known
hand
,
as
he
sat
upon
the
judgement
seat
:
And
it
ame
to
pass
that
in
the
same
year
,
that
his
son
,
which
had
been
appointed
by
the
people
in
his
stead
,
was
also
murdered
,
And
thus
ended
the
sixty
and
sixth
year
.
And
in
fhe
comnencement
of
the
sixty
and
seventh
year
,
the
people
began
to
grow
exceeding
wicked
again
.
For
behold
,
the
Lord
had
Hlessed
them
so
long
with
the
riches
of
the
world
,
that
they
had
not
been
stirred
up
to
anger
,
to
wars
,
nor
to
bloodsheds
;
therefore
they
began
to
set
their
hearts
upon
their
riches
;
yea
,
they
began
fo
seek
to
get
gain
,
that
they
might
be
lifted
up
one
above
another
;
therefore
they
began
to
commit
secret
murders
,
and
to
rob
,
and'to
plunder
,
that
they
might
get
gain
.
And
now
behold
,
those
murderers
and
plunderers
were
a
band
Which
bad
been
formed
by
Kishkumen
and
Gadianton
.
And
how
it
had
come
to
pass
that
there
were
many
,
even
among
the
Nephites
,
of
Gadianton's
band
.
But
behold
,
they
were
lore
mimerous
among
the
more
wicked
part
of
the
Lamanles
.
And
they
were
called
Gadianton's
robbers
and
murderes
;
and
it
was
they
which
did
murder
the
Chief
Judge
Cezokm
,
and
his
son
,
while
in
the
judgement
seat
;
yand
behold
,
they
were
not
found
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lamanites
found
there
were
robbers
among
thei
,
they
were
exceeding
sor
wlul
;
and
they
did
use
every
means
whatsoever
was
in
[File:428]
their
power
,
to
destroy
them
off
the
face
of
-
tlic
earth
.
”
Bye
behold
,
satan
did
stir
up
the
hearts
of
the
more
parts
of
the
Nephites
,
insomuch
that
they
did
unite
with
those
bands
robbers
,
and
did
enter
ieto
their
covenants
,
and
their
oaths
,
that
they
would
protect'
and
preserve
one
another
,
in
whatsoever
diflieult
circumstances
they
should
be
placed
in
,
that
they
should
not
suffer
for
their
murders
,
and
their
plunderings
,
and
their
stealings
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
have
their
signs
,
yea
,
their
secret
signs
,
and
their
secret
words
;
and
this
that
they
wight
distinguish
a
brother
who
had
entered
into
the
covenant
,
that
whatsoever
wickedness
his
brother
should
do
,
he
should
not
be
injured
by
his
brother
,
nor
by
those
who
did
belong
to
his
band
,
who
had
taken
this
covenant
;
and
thus
they
might
murder
,
and
plunder
,
and
steal
,
and
commit
whorcdoms
,
and
all
manner
of
wickedness
,
contrary
to
the
Jaws
of
their
coun
try
,
and
also
the
laws
of
their
God
;
and
whosoever
of
those
which
belonged
to
their
band
,
should
reveal
unto
the
world
of
their
wickedness
and
their
abominations
,
should
be
tried
,
not
according
to
the
.
Jaws
of
their
country
,
but
according
to
the
laws
of
their
wickedness
,
which
had
heen'given
by
Gadianton
and
Kishkumen
.
Now
behold
,
it
is
these
secret
oaths
and
covenants
,
which
Alma
commanded
his
son
should
not
go
forth
unto
the
world
,
lest
they
should
be
a
means
of
bringing
down
the
people
unto
destruction
.
Now
behold
,
those
secret
oaths
and
covenants
did
not
come
forth
unto
Gadianton
from
the
records
which
were
delivered
unto
Helaman
;
but
behold
,
they
eee
put
into
the
heart
of
Gadianton
,
by
that
same
being
who
did
entice
our
first
parents
to
partake
of
the
forbidden
tru
;
yea
,
that
same
heing
who
did
plot
with
Cain
,
that
if
he
would
murder
his
brother
Abel
,
it
should
not

known
unto
the
world
,
And
he
did
plot
wilh
Cain
and
his
fellowers
,
from
that
time
forth
.
And
also
it
is
that
same
being
whe
put
it
into
the
hearts
of
the
people
,
to
build
a
tower
sufficiently
high
thal
ee
:
get
to
Heaven
.
And
it
was
that
same
being
which
led
on
the
people
which
came
from
that
tower
,
into
:
this
tand
;
which
spread
the
works
of
darkness
and
abominations
ove
!
all
thevface
ofthe
land
,
until
he
dragged
the
people
down
an
entire
dgstruction
,
and
to
an
everlasting
hell
;
yea
,
it
isthal
same
beiig
who
put
it
into
the
heart
of
Gadianton
,
to
still
ca
ry
oh
the
work
of
darkness
,
and
of
secret
murder
;
and
he
hath
brought
it
forth
from
the
beginning
of
man
,
even
down
1
this
time
,
And
behold
,
it
is
he
which
is
the
author
of
all
sit
[File:429]
And
behold
,
he
doth
carry
.
on
his
works
of
davkness
and
seget
murder
,
and
doth
hand
down
their
plots
,
and
their
aaths
,
and
their
covenants
,
and
their
plans
of
awful
wickedness
,
from
.
generation
to
generation
,
according
as
he
can
get
hold
upon
the
hearts
of
the
children
,
of
men
,.
And
now
behold
,
he
had
got
great
hold
upon
the
hearts
of
the
Nephites
;
yea
,
insomuch
that
they
had
become
exceeding
wicked
;
yea
,
the
more
part
ofthem
had
turned
out
of
the
way
of
rightcousness
,
and
did
trample
under
their
-
feet
the
commandments
of
Ged
,
and
did
tum
unio
their
own
ways
,
and
did
build
up
unto
themselves
idols
.
of
their
gold
and
their
silver
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
all
these
iniquities
did
come
unto
them
,
in
the
space
of
not
many
years
,
imsorouch
that
a
more
pattof
it
had
come
unto
them
inthe
sixty
and
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
they
didgrow
in
their
iniquities
,
in
the
sixty
and
eighth
year
also
,
fothe
great
sorrow
and
lamentation
of
the
righteous
.
And
thus
we
sce
that
the
Nephites
did
begin
to
dwindle
in
unbelief
,
al
grow
in
wickedness
and
abominations
,
while
the
Lamanites
began
t6
grow
exceedingly
in
the
knowledge
of
their
God
;
yea
.
they
did
begin
to
keep
his
statutes
and
commandments
,
alto
walk
in
truth
and
uprightness
before
him
.
And
thus
we
see
that
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
began
to
withdraw
from
the
Nephites
,
beeause
of
the
wickedness
and
the
hardnes
of
their
,
hears
,
And
thus
we
sce
that
the
Lord
began
to
pour
out
his
spitit
upon
the
Lamanites
,
because
of
their
easiness
and
wilIngness
to
believe
in
his
word
.
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
hunt
the
band
.
robbers
of
eukarhons
and
they
did
preach
the
word
of
God
among
the
nore
wicked
part
of
them
,
insomuch
that
this
.
tand
of
robbers
was
utterly
destroyed
from
.
among
the
Lamaniis
,
And
it
came
to
pass
.
on
the
other
hand
,
that
the
Nephites
did
build
them
up
and
.
support
them
,
beginning
at
the
more
Wicked
part
of
them
,
until]
they
had
overspread
all
the
.
Jand
of
the
Nephites
,
and
had
seduced
the
more
part
of
the
rightcous
,
will
they
had
come
down
to
believe
in
their
works
,
and
par
-
—
tike
of
their
spoils
,
and
to
join
with
them
in
their
secret
m
dts
and
combinations
.
And
thus
they
did
obtain
the
sole
Management
of
the
government
,
insomuch
that
they
did
tramPe
under
their
feet
,
and
smite
,
and
rend
,
and
turn
their
backs
non
the
poor
,
and
the
meek
,
and
humble
followers
of
God
.
And
thus
we
see
that
they
were
in
an
awful
state
,
and
ripen

for
an

Bexorn
,
now
it
came
to

in
the
sixty
and
ninth
yeard
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
the
Nephites
,
tht
Nephi
,
the
son
of

,
returned
to
the
land
of
Zarahomlg
from
the
land
northward
:
for
he
had
been
forth
among
the
people
which
was
in
the
land
northward
,
and
did
preach
the
word
of
God
unto
them
,
and
did
prophesy
many
things
wo
them
;
and
they
did
reject
all
his
wogds
,
insomuch
that
he
could
not
stay
among'them
,
but
returned
again
unto
the
lad
of
his
nativity
;
and
seeing
the
people
in
a
state
of
such
awil
ickedness
,
and
those
Gadianton
robbers
filling
the
judgemell
;
having
usurped
the
power
and
authority
of
the
land
ing
aside
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
not
in
the
leat
aright
before
him
;
doing
no
justice
unto
the
children
of
met
condemning
the
righteous
hecause
of
their
righteousness
;
Ie
ting
the
guilty
and
the
wicked
go
unpunished
,
bacause
of
ther
money
;
and
moreover
,
to
be
held
in
office
at
the
head
of
gor
erament
,
to
rule
and
do
according
to
their
wills
,
that
they
might
get
gain

glory
of

;
and
moreover
that
ther
might
the
more
easy
commit
adultery
,
and
steal
,
and
kill
,
and
do
aecording
to
their
own
wills
.
Now
this
great
iniquity
hed
come
upon
the
Nephites
,
in
the
space
of
not
many
years
;
a
when
Nephi
saw
it
,
his
heart
was
swollen
with
sorrow
withio
his
breast
;
and
he
did
exclaim
in
the
agony
of
his
soul
,
0
that
I
could
have
had
my
days
,
in
the
days
when
my
father
Nephi
first
came
out
of
the
landsof
Jerusalem
,
that
xs
[File:431]
qwe
joyed
with
him
in'
the
promised
Jind
;
then
were
bis
pople
exsy
to
be
-
enweated
,
firm
to
keep
the
commandments
(
God
,
and
slow
to
be
led
to
do
iniquity
;
and
they
were
wick
to
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
if
my
days
muld
have
been
in
them
days
,
then
would
my
soul
have
had
prin
the
rightcousness
of
my
brethren
.
.
But
behold
,
I
am
wnsigued
that
these
are
my
days
,
and
that
my
soul
shall
be
filed
with
sorrow
,
because
of
this
the
wickedness
of
my
brethyo
,
And
behold
;
now
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
upon
a
wwer
,
which
was
in
the
garden
of
Nephi
,
which
was
by
the
highway
which
led
to
the
chief
market
,
which
was
in
the
city
d
Zarahemla
;
therefore
,
Nephi
,
had
bowed
himself
upon
te
tower
which
was
in
his
garden
,
whieh
tower
was
also
near
ito
the
garden
gate
which
led
by
the
higway
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
certain
men
passing
by
,
ind
saw
Nephi
as
he
was
pouring
out
his
soul
unto
God
:
upmthe
tower
,
and
they
ran
and
told
the
people
what
they
hud
wen
;
and
the
people
came
together
in
multitudes
that
they
tight
know
-
the
cause
of
so
great
mourning
for
the
wickedwsof
the
people
.
And
now
when
Nephi
arose
he
beheld
femultitudes
of
people
which
had
gathered
together
.
And
keame
to
pass
that
he
opened
his
mouth
and
said
unto
them
,
Bol
,
why
have
ye
gathered
yourselves
together
?
That

Ree
And
now
it
came
io
pass
that
when
Nephi
had
said
the'
words
,
behold
there
were
men
which
were
Judges
,
which
belonged
to
the
secret
band
of
Gadianton
,
and
they
were
ane
)
and
.
they
cried
out
against
him
,
saying
unto
the
pel
why
do
ye
not
seize
upon
this
man
and
bring
him
forth
!
he
may
be
condemned
according
to
the
crime
which
hel
done
?
Why
seest
thou
this
man
,
and
hearest
him
against
this
people
,
and
against
our
law
?
-
For
behold
,
M
[File:433]
yi
spoken
unto
them
concerning
the
corruptness
of
their
gp
;
yea
,
many
things
did
Nephi
speak
which
cannot
be
writt
9
;
ind
nothing
did
he
speak
which
were
contrary
to
the
gmandments
of
God
.
And
those
Judges
were
angry
with
ja
because
he
spake
plain
unto
them
concerning
their
secret
rks
of
darkness
;
nevertheless
they
durst
not
lay
their
own
ads
upon
him
;
for
they
feared
the
people
,
lest
they
should
out
against
them
;
therefore
they
did
cry
unto
the
people
,
jong
,
Why
do
ye
suffer
this
man
to
revile
against
us
?
For
old
,
he
doth
condemn
all
this
people
,
even
unto
destrucim
;
yea
,
and
-
also
that
these
our
great
cities
shall
be
taken
im
us
,
that
we
shall
have
no
place
in
them
.
And
now
we
y
that
this
is
impossible
;
for
behold
we
are
powerful
,
and
cities
great
;
therefore
our
enemies
can
have
no
power
rus
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
they
did
stir
up
the
ple
to
anger
egainst
Nephi
,
and
:
raised
contentions
among
en
;
for
there
were
,
some
which
did
-
ery
out
,
Let
this
man
ime
,
for
he
is
a
good
man
,
and
these
things
which
he
saith
dlsirely
come
to
pass
except
werepent
;
yea
,
behold
ali
the
ments
will
come
upon
us
which
he
hath
testified
unto
us
;
eve
know
that
he
hath
testified
aright
unto
us
converning
ariuiquities
.
And
behold
they
are
many
;
and
he
knoweth
swell
al
things
which
shall
hefal
us
as
he
knoweth
of
our
aplies
;
yea
,
and
behold
if
he
had
not
been
a
prophet
he
ald
not
have
testified
concerning
those
things
.
And
it
came
ass
that
those
people
which
sought
to
destroy
Nephi
,
were
otpelled
becanse
of
their
fear
,
that
they
did
not
Jay
their
iisonhim
.
Therefore
he
began
again
to
speak
unto
them
,

And

testify
of
these

also
all
the
holy
prophets
,
from

Behold
nowit
came
to

that
when
Nepbi
had
spoken
lise
words
,
certain
men
which
were
among
them
ran
to
the
pigement
seat
;
yea
,
even
there
were
five
which
went
;
and
hey
said
among
themselves
,
as
they
went
,
Behold
,
now
we
will
know
of
a

,
whether
this
man
be
a

and
Gol
hath
commanded
him
to
prophesy
such
marvellous

unto

Behold
we
do
not

yea
,
edo
not
believe
that
he
is
a

;
nevertheless
,
if
this
ling
which
he
hath
said
concerning
the
Chief
Judge
be
true
,
lot
he
be
dead
,
then
will
we
believe
that
the
other
words
Which
he
hath
spoken
.
is
true
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
€nin
their
might
,
and
came
in
unto
the
judgement
scat
;
and
,
Whold
the
Chief
Judge
had
folien
to
the
earth
,
and
did
lie
in
is
blood
.
And
now
behold
,
when
they
saw
this
,
they
were
onished
exceedingly
,
insomuch
that
they
fell
to
the
carth
;
fonthey
had
not
believed
the
words
which
Nepti
had
spoken
Meerning
the
Chief
Judge
;
but
now
when
they
suw
they
leieved
,
and
fear
came
upon
them
,
lest
all
the
judgements
Mtich
Nephi
had
spoken
should
come
upon
the
people
;
there
hey
did
quake
,
and
had
fallen
to
the
earth
,
Now
imtediately
when
the
Judge
had
been
murdered
:
he
being
stzbby
his
brother
,
by
a
garb
of
secrecy
;
end
he
fled
,
and
the
Hrranis
ran
and
told
the
people
,
raising
the
cry
of
raurder
them
,
And
behold
the
people
did
gather
themselves
unto
ihe
place
of
ihe
judgement
seat
;
and
behold
,
[File:436]
to
their
astonishment
,
they
saw
those
five
men
which
had
fal
.
en
to
the
garth
.
And
now
behold
,
the
people
knew
nothing
ey
the
multitude
which
had
gathered
together
at
the
garden
of
Nephi
;
therefore
they
said
among
themselves
,
These
men
are
they
which
have
murdered
the
Judge
,
and
God
hath
smitten
them
that
they
could
not
flee
from
us
.
And
it
came
te
pass
that
they
laid
hold
on
them
,
and
bound
_
them
,
and
cast
them
into
prison
,
And
there
was
a
proclame
tion
sent
abroad
that
the
Judge
was
slain
,
and
that
the
mur
derers
had
been
taken
,
and
was
cast
into
prison
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
,
the
people
did
assemble
themselves
together
to
mourn
and
to
:
fast
,
at
the
burial
of
the
great
and
Chief
Judge
,
which
had

And
thus
were
also
those
Judges
which
were
at
the
garden
of
Nephi
,
aul
heard
his
words
,
were
algo
gathered
together
at
the
burial

And
it
eame
to
pass
that
they
inquired
among
the
people
,
saying
,
Where
are
the
five
which
was
sent
to
inquire
concen
ing
the
Chief
Judge
whether
he
was

And
they
answer
ed
and
said
,
Concerning
this
five
which
ye
say
yethave
sent
,
we
know
not
;
but
there
are
five
,
which
are
the
murderers
,
whom
We
have
castinto
prison
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Judges
det
xed
that
they
should
be
brought
;
and
they
were
brought
,
and
hehold
they
were
the
five
which
were
sent
;
and
behold
the
Judges
inguired
of
them
to
knaw
concerning
the
matter
,
and
they
told
them
all
that
they
had
done
,
saying
,
We
ran
and
came
to
the
place
of
the
judgement
,
and
when
we'
saw
all
things
,
even
®
Nephi
had
testified
,
we
were
astonished
,
insomuch
that
welel
io
the
earth
sand
when
we
were
recovered
from
our
astonish
ment
,
behold
they
cast
us
into

Now
as
for
the
mur
der
of
this
man
,
we
know
not
who
hath
done
it
,
and
only
this
much
we

,
we
ran
and
came
according
as
ye
dest
and
behold
he
was
dead
according
to
the
words
of
Nephi
.
”
And
now
it
came
to
pass
,
that
the
Judges
did
expound
the
matter
mto
the
people
,
and
did
cry
ont
against
Nephi
,
saying
Behold
we
know
that
this
Nephi
must
have
agreed
with
som
one
to
slay

the
Judge
,
and
then
he
might
declare
it
unto
%
that
he
might
convert
us
unto
his
faith
,
that
he
might
rats
himself
to
be

,
and
he
shall
confess

and
make

true
murderer
of
this
Jude
And
itcame
to
pass
thet
the
five
were
liberated
on
the
day

burial
.
Nevertheless
,
they
did
rebuke
the
Judges
in
the
vrords
which
they
had
spoken
against
Nephi
,
end
did
conte'
[File:437]
with
them
one
by
one
,
insomuch
that
they
did
confound
them
.
Nevertheless
,
they
causcd
that
Nephi
should
be
taken
and
bound
and
brought
before
the
multitude
,
and
they
began
to
question
him
in
divers
ways
,
that
they
might
cross
him
,
that
they
might
accuse
him
to
death
;
saying
unto
him
,
Thou
art
confederate
;
who
is
this
man
that
hath
done
this
murder
?
Now
tell
us
,
and
acknowledge
thy
fault
,
saying
,
Behold
here
is
money
;
and
also
we
will
grant
unto
thee
thy
life
if
thou
wilt
tell
us
and
acknowledge
the
agreement
which
thou
hast
made
with
him
.
But
Nephi
saith
unto
them
,
O
ye
fools
,
ye
uncir
cumsised
of
heart
,
ye
blind
,
and
ye
stitf

O

time
whieh

Behold
,
yesay
that
I
have
agreed
with
a
man
,
that
he
should
murder
Seezoram
,
our
Chief
Judge
.
But
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
ihat
this
is
:
because
I
have
testified
unto
you
,
that
ye
might
know
concerning
this
thing
;
yea
,
even
for
a
witness
unto
you
,
that
I
did
know
of
the
wickedness
and
abominations
which
is
among

.
And
beeause
have
done
this
,

that
have
ssreed
with
a
man
that
he
should
do
this
thing
;
yea

because
Ishewed

,
ye
are
angry
with

,
and

.
And
now
behold
,

will
shew
umto
you

sign
,
and
see
if
ye
will
in
this
thing
seek
to
destroy
me
,
Bebold
I
say
unto
you
,
Go
to
the
house
of
Seantum
,
which
is
the
brother
of
Seezoram
,
and
say
unto
him
,
Hath
Nephi
,
the
pretended
prophet
,
which
doth
prophesy
so
much
til
concerning
this
people
,
agreed
with
thee
,
in
the
which
ye
tave
murdered
Seezoram
,
which
is
your
-
brother
?
And
betold
,
he
shall
say
unto
you
,
Nay
.
And
yc
shall
say
unto
him
,
Hive
ye
murdered
your
brother
?
And
he
shall
stand
with
:
tear
,
and
wist
not
what
to
say
,
And
behold
,
he
shall
deny
sto
you
;
and
he
shall
make
as
if
he
were
astonished
;
nevyertheless
,
he
shall
declare
unto
you
that
he
is
innocent
.
But
behold
,
ye
.
shall
examine
him
,
and
ye
shall
find
blood
upon
the
skirtsof
his
cloak
,
And
when
ye
have
seen
this
,
ye
shall
say
,
From
whence
cometh
this
blood
?
Do
we
not
know
that
it
1s
the
blood
of
your
brother
?
And
then
shall
he
tremble
,
and
Mall
look
pale
,
even
as
if
death
had
come
upon
him
.
And
then
shall
ye
say
,
Because
of
this
fear
and
this
paleness
which
tath
come
upon
your
face
,
behold
,
we
know
that
thou
art
Suit
,
And
then
shall
greater
fear
come
upon
him
;
and
then
[File:438]
shall
he
confess
unto
you
,
and
deny
no
more
that
he
hath
dane
this
murder
.
And
then
shall
he
say
unto
you
,
That
1
,
Nephi
,
know
nothing
concerning
the
matter
,
save
it
were
given
unto
me
by
the
power
of
God
.
And
then
shall
ye
know
that
[am
an
honest
man
,
and
that
I
am
sent
unto
you
from
God
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
and
did
,
even
according
as
Nephi
had
said
unto
them
.
And
behold
,
the
words
which
he
had
said
,
were
true
:
for
according
to
the
words
,
he
did
deny
;
and
also
according
to
the
words
,
he
did
confess
.
And
he
was
brought
to
prove
that
he
himself
was
the
very
murder
er
,
insomuch
that
the
five
were
set
at
liberty
;
and
also
was
Nephi
.
And
there
were
some
of
the
Nephites
which
believed
on
the
words
of
Nephi
;
and
there
were
some
also
,
which
he
lieved
,
because
of
tle
testimony
of
the
five
,
for
they
had
been
converted
while
they
were
in
prison
.
And
now
there
were
some
among
the
people
,
which
said
that
Nephi
was
a
prophet
;
and
there
were
others
which
said
,
Behold
,
he
is
a
god
,
for
ex
cepthe
was
a
god
,
he
could
not
know
of
all
things
.
For
be
hold
,
he
hath
told
us
the
thoughts
of
our
hearts
,
and
also
hath
told
us
things
;
and
even
he
hath
brought
unto
our
knowledge
the
true
murderer
of
our
Chie
Judge
.
And
it
care
to
pass
that
there
arose
a
diviston
among
the
-
people
,
insomuch
that
they
divided
hither
and
thither
,
and
went
their
ways
,
leaving
Nephi
alone
,
as
he
was
standing
in
the
midst
of
them
.
And
il
cathe
to
pass
that
Nephi
went
his
way
towards
his
own
house
,
pondering
upon
the
things
which
the
Lord
had
shewn
unto
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
thus
pondering
,—
being
much
cast
down
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
of
the
Nephites
,
their
secret
works
of
darkness
,
and
their
murderings

a
voice
came
unto
him
,
saying
:

And
now

you
that
ye

that
thus

the
Lord

,
who
is
the
Almighty
:

,
And
behold
,
now
it
came
to

that
when
the
Lord
had
spoken
these
words
unto
Nephi
,
he
did
stop
,
and
did
not
go
unto
his
own
house
,
but
did
return
unto
the
multitudes
which
Were
scattered
about
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
began
to
declare
unto
them
the
word
of
the
Lord
,
which
had
been
spoken
unto
him
concerning
their
destruction
,

behold
,
notwithstanding
that
great
miracle
which
Nophi
had
done
in
telling
them
concerning

death

Chef
Judge
,
they
did
harden
their
hearts
,
and
did
not
hearken
into
the
Words
of

Lord
;
therefore
Nephi
did
declare
unto
them
the
word
of
the
Lord
,
saying
:
Except

saith
the
Lord
:

,
they
did
still
harden
their
hearts
,
and
would
tlhearken
unto
his
words
;
therefore
they
did

against

did
seek
to
lay

that
they
might

the

,
and
they
could
not
take
him
to
cast
him
into

:
for
he
was
taken
by
the
spirit
,
and
conveyed
away
out
of
the
lidst
of
them
,
And
it
came
to

that
thus
he
did
go

CHAPTER
Ty
.
Anp
now
it
caine
to
pass
in
the
seventy
and
second
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
,
that
the
contentions
did
increase
,
insomuch
that
there
were
wars
throughout
all
the
land
,
among
all
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
it
was
this
secret
band
of
robbers
which
did
carry
on
this
work
of
destruction
and
wickedness
,
Ang
this
war
did
last
all
that
year
.
And
in
the
seventy
and
third
year
it
did
also
last
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
year
,
Nephi
did
cry
unto
the
Lord
,
saying
:
O
Lord
,
do
not
suffer
that
this
people
shall
be
destroyed
by
the
sword
;
but
O
Lord
,
rather
let
there
be
a
famine
m
the
land
,
to
stir
then
:
up
in
remembrance
of
te
Lord
their
God
,
and
perhaps
they
will
repent
and
turn
unto
thee
;
and
so
it
was
done
,
according
to
the
words
of
Nephi
—
And
there
was
a
great
faraine
upon
the
land
,
among
all
th
people
of
Nephi
.
And
thus
,
in
the
seventy
and
fourth
yea
,
the
famine
did
continue
,
and
the
work
of
destruction
did
cease
by
the
sword
,
but
became
sore
by
famine
.
And
this
work
of
destruction
did
also
continue
in
the
seventy
and
fifth
year
,
For
ibe
earth
was
smitten
,
that
it
was
dry
,
and
did
not
yield
fort
grain
in
the
season
of
grain
,
and
the
whole
earth
was
smiltes
,
even
among
the
Lamanites
as
well
.
as
among
the
Nephites
,
9
that
they
were
smitten
that
they
did
perish
by
thousands
,
it
the
more
wicked
parts
of
the
Jand
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
saw
that
they
wer
about
to
perish
by
famine
,
and
they
began
to
remember
the
Lord
their
God
;
and
they
began
to
remember
the
words
Nephi
.
And
the
people
began
to
plead
with
their
Chief
Judge
and
their
leaders
,
that
they
would
say
unto
Nephi
,
Behold
,
know
that
thou
arta
man
of
God
,
and
therefore
cry
unte
tt
Lord
our
God
,
that
he
turn
away
from
us
this
famine
,
lest
the
words
which
thou
hast
spoken
concerning
our
destructios
be
fulfilled
.
And
itcame
to
pass
that
the
Judges
did
say
to
Nephi
,
according
to
the
words
which
had
been
desirel~
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Nephi
saw
that
the
people
tat
[File:441]
repented
,
and
did
humble
themselves
in
sackcloth
,
he
cried
again
unto
the
Lord
,
saying
:
O
Lord
,
behold
this
people
repenteth
;
and
they
have
swept
away
the
band
of
Gadianton
from
amongst
them
,
insomuch
that
they
have
become
extinct
,
and
they
bave
concealed
their
secret
plans
inthe
earth
.
Now
,
0
Lord
,
because
of
this
their
humility
,
wilt
thou
turn
away
thine
anger
,
and
let
thine
anger
be
appeased
in
the
destruction
of
those
wicked
men
whom
thou
hast
already
destroyed
?
O
Lord
,
wilt
thou
turn
away
thine
anger
,
yea
,
thy
fierce
anger
,
and
cause
that
this
famine
may
cease
in
this
land
?
O
Lord
,
wilt
thou
Learken
unto
me
,
and
cause
that
it
may
be
dome
according
to
my
words
,
and
send
forth
rain
upon
tbe
face
of
the
earth
,
that
she
may
bring
forth
her
fruit
and
her
grain
,
in
the
season
of
grain
?
O
Lord
,
thou
didst
hearken
unto
my
words
when
I
said
,
Let
there
be
a
famine
,
that
the
pestilence
of
the
sword
might
cease
;
and
I
know
that
thou
wilt
,
even
at
this
time
,
hearken
unto
my
words
;
for
thou
saidst
,
That
if
this
people
repent
,
.
1
will
spare
them
;
yea
,
O
Lord
,
and
thou
seest
(
lat
they
have
repented
,
because
of
the
famine
,
and
the
pestilence
and
destruction
which
has
come
unto
them
.
And
now
,
O
Lord
,
wilt
thon
turn
away
thine
anger
,
and
try
again
if
they
will
serve
thee
?
And
if
so
,
O
Lord
,
thou
canst
bless
them
according
to
thy
words
which
thou
hast
said
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
seventy
and
sixth
year
,
the
Lord
did
turn
away
his
anger
from
the
people
,
and
caused
that
rain
should
fall
upon
the
earth
,
insomuch
that
it
did
bring
forth
her
fruit
in
the
season
of
her
fruit
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
it
did
bring
forth
her
grain
,
in
the
season
of
her
grain
.
And
behold
,
the
people
did
rejoice
,
and
glorify
God
;
and
the
whole
face
of
the
land
was
filled
with
rejoicing
;
and
they
did
no
more
seek
to
destroy
Nephi
,
but
they
did
esteem
him
as
a
great
prophet
,
and
a
man
of
God
,
having
great
power
and
authority
tiven
unto
him
from
God
.
And
behold
,
Lehi
,
his
brother
,
was
not
a
whit
bebind
him
as
to
things
pertaining
to
righteousness
.
And
thus
it
did
come
to
pass
that
the
people
of
Nephi
began
—
_
to
prosper
again'in
the
land
,
and
began
to
build
up
their
waste
places
,
and
began
to
multiply
and
spread
,
even
until
they
did
-
cover
the
whole
face
of
the
land
,
both
on
the
northward
and
:
on
the
southward
,
from
the
sea
west
,
to
the
sea
east
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
seventy
and
sixth
year
did
end
in
peace
.
And
the
seventy
and
seventh
year
began
in
peace
;
and
the
church
did
spread
throughout
the
face
of
all
the
land
;
and
the
more
part
of
the
people
,
both
the
-
Nephites
and
the
Lamanites
,
[File:442]
did
belong
to
the
church
;
and
they
did
have
exceeding
great
peace
in
the
land
,
And
thus
ended
the
seventy
and
seventh
year
,
And
also
they
had
peace
in
the
seventy
and
eighth
year
,
save
it
were
a
few
contentions
concerning
the
points
of
doc
.
trine
which
had
been
laid
down
by
the
prophets
.
And
in
the
seventy
and
ninth
year
,
there
began
to
be
much
strife
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
and
Lehi
,
and
many
of
their
breth
.
ren
,
which
knew
concerning
the
true
points
of
doctrine
,
having
many
revelations
daily
,
therefore
they
did
preach
unto
the
people
,
insomuch
that
they
did
put
an
end
to
their
strife
in
that
same
year
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
eightieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
there
were
a
certain
num
her
of
the
dissenters
from
the
people
of
Nephi
,
which
had
some
years
before
gone
over
unto
the
Lamanites
,
and
1ook
upon
themselves
the
name
of
Lamanites
;
and
also
,
a
tertain
number
which
were
veal
descendants
of
the
Lamanites
,
being
stirred
up
to
anger
by
them
,
or
by
those
dissenters
,
therefore
they
commenced
a
war
with
theiy
brethren
.
And
they
did
commit
murder
and
plunder
;
and
then
they
would
retreat
back
into
the
mountains
,
and
into
the
wilderness
and
secret
places
,
hiding
themselves
that
they
could
not
be
discovered
,
receiving
daily
an
addition
to
their
numbers
,
inasmuch
as
there
were
dissenters
that
went
forth
unto
them
;
and
thus
in
time
,
yea
,
even
in
the
space
of
not
many
years
,
they
became
an
exceeding
great
band
of
robbers
;
and
they
did
search
out
all
the
secret
plans
of
Gadianton
;
and
thus
they
became
robbers
of
Gadianton
.
Now
behold
,
these
robbers
did
make
great
havoo
,
yea
,
even
great
destruction
among
the
people
of
Nephi
,
and
also
suniong
the
people
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
stop
put
to
this
work
of
destruction
;
therefore
they
sent
.
an
army
of
strong
men
into
the
wilderness
,
and
upon
the
mountains
,
10
search
out
this
band
of
robbers
,
and
to
destroy
them
.
But
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
in
that
same
year
,
they
were
driven
back
even
into
their
own
lands
.
And
thus
ended
the
eri
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
ephi
.
And
it
cathe
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
eighty
and
first
year
,
they
did
go
forth
again
against
this
band
of
robbers
,
and
did
destroy
many
;
and
they
were
also
visited
with
much
destruction
;
and
they
were
again
obliged
to
return
out
of
the
wildemess
,
and
out
of
the
mountains
,
unto
their
own
Jands
,
[File:443]
peeause
of
the
exceeding
greatness
of
the
numbers
of
those
robbers
which
infested
the
mountains
and
the
wilderness
.—
And
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
ended
this
year
.
And
the
robhers
did
still
increase
and
wax
strong
,
insomuch
that
they
did
defy
the
whole
arinics
of
the
Nephites
,
and
also
of
the
Lamanites
;
and
they
did
cause
great
fcar
to
come
unto
the
people
,
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
;
yea
,
for
they
did
visit
many
parts
of
the
land
,
and
did
do
great
destruction
unto
them
;
yea
,
did
kill
many
,
and
did
carry
away
others
captive
into
the
wilderness
;
yea
,
and
more
especially
their
women
and
their
children
.
Now
this
great
evil
,
which
came
unto
the
people
because
of
their
iniquity
,
did
stir
them
up
again
in
remembrance
of
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
thus
ended
the
cighty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
.
And
in
the
cighty
and
second
year
,
ihey
began
again
to
forget
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
in
the
eighty
and
third
year
,
they
began
to
wax
strong
in
iniquity
.—
And
in
the
eighty
and
fourth
year
,
they
did
not
mend
their
ways
.
And
if
came
to
pass
in
the
eighty
and
fifth
year
,
they
did
wax
stronger
and
stronger
in
their
pride
,
and
in
their
wickedness
;
and
thus
they
were
ripening
again
for
destruc
-
.
tion
.
And
thus
ended
the
eighty
and
fifth
year
.
And
thus
we
can
behold
how
false
,
and'
also
the
unsteadiness
of
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
;
yea
,
we
can
see
that
the
Lord
in
his
great
infinite
goodness
,
doth
bless
and
prosper
those
who
put
their
trust
in
him
;
yea
,
and
we
may
see
at
the
very
time
when
he
doth
prosper
his
people
;
yea
,
in
the
increase
of
their
fields
,
their
flocks
,
and
their
herds
,
and
in
gold
,
and
in
silver
,
and
in
all
manner
of
precious
things
of
every
kind
and
art
;
sparing
their
lives
,
and
delivering
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
;
softening
the
hearts
of
their
enemies
,
that
they
should
not
declare
wars
against
them
;
yea
,
and
in
fine
,
doing
all
things
for
the
welfare
and
bappmess
of
his
people
;
yea
,
then
is
the
time
that
they
do
harden
their
hearts
,
and
do
forget
the
Lord
their
God
,
and
do
trample
under
their
feet
the
Holy
One
;
yea
,
and
this
because
of
their
ease
,
and
their
exceeding
great
prosperity
..
And
thus
we
see
,
that
except
the
Lord
doth
chasten
his
people
with
many
afflictions
,
yea
,
except
he
doth
visit
them
with
death
,
and
with
terror
,
and
with
famine
,
and
with
all
manner
of
pestilences
,
they
will
not

While

And

And

But

And
it
came
to

that
they

therefore
he
went

and
stretched
forth
his

and
cried
with
a
loud
oie
,
and

Anit

I
will
with

,
and
I
will
suffer
them
no
longa

and
I
will
turn
the
hearts
of
their

away
,
before
I
will
cae

And

And
behold
thus

bath
the
angel
spoken
into
me
;
for
he
said
unto
me
,
That
there
should
be
thunder
ings
and
lightnings
for
the

and
he
said
uito
me
that
while
the
thunder

and
thetempest
,
that
these
things
should
be

and
that
darkness
should
cover
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
,
for
the
space
of
three
days
.
And
the
angel
said
unto
me
that
many
shull
see
greater
things
than
these
,
to
the
.
intent
that
they
might
believe
hat
these
signs
and
these
wonders
should
come
to
pass
,
upon
dl
the
face
of
this
land
;
to
the
intent
that
there
-
should
be
no
cause
for
unbelief
among
the
children
of
men
;
and
this
to
the
wfnt
that
whosoever
will
believe
,
might
be
saved
,
and
that
Wusoever
will
not
believe
,
a
righteous
judgement
might
come
tponthem
;
and
also
if
they
are
condemned
,
they
bringupon
flemselves
their
own
condemmation
.
And
now
remember
,
remember
,
my
brethren
,
that
whosoever
perisheth
,
perisheth
unto
himself
;
and
whosoever
doeth
miquity
,
doeth
it
unto
himself
;
for
behold
ye
are
free
;
ye
are
permitted
to
act
for

;
fur
behold

God
hath
given
unto
you
a

hold
,
they
have
been
a
chosen
people
ot
the
Lord
;
yea
,
ite
people
of
Nephi
hath
he
loved
,
and
also
hath
he
chastened
them
;
yea
,
in
the
days
of
their
iniquities
hath
he
chastened
them
,
because
he
loveth
:
them
.
But
behold
my
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
hath
he
hated
,
because
their
deeds
have
been
eri]
continually
-;
and
this
because
of
the
iniquity
of
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
.
But
behold
,
salvation
hath
come
unto
them
,
through
the
preaching
of
the
Nephites
;
and
for
this
inten
:
hath
the
Lord
prolonged
their
days
.
And
I
would
that
ye
should
behold
that
the
more
part
of
them
are
in
the
pathol
their
duty
,
and
they
do
walk
circumspectly
before
God
,
aul
they
do
observe
to
kecp
his
commandments
,
and
his
statutes
and
his
judgements
,
according
to
the
law
of
Moses
.
Yea
!
say
unto
you
,
that
the
mere
part
of
them
are
doing
this
,
and
they
are
striving
,
with
unwearied
diligence
,
that
.
they
may
bring
the
remainder
of
their
brethren
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
;
therefore
there
are
many
which
do
add
to
their
nim
bers
daily
.
And
behold
ye
do
know
of
yourselves
,
for
ye
have
witnessed
it
,
that
as
many
of
them
as
are
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
,
and
to
know
of
the
wicked
and
abominabie
traditions
of
their
fathers
,
and
ate
lead
to
believe
the
Holy
Scriptures
,
yea
,
the
prophecies
of
the
boly
prophels
which
are
written
,
which
leadeth
then
to
faith
on
the
Lor
,
and
unto
repentance
,
which
faith
and
repentance
bringeth
change
of
heart
unto
them
;
therefore
as
many
as
have
come
to
this
,
ye
know
of
yourselve
,
are
firm
and
steadfast
in
tle
faith
,
and
in
the
thing
wherewith
they
have
been
made
free
—
And
ye
know
also
that
they
have
buried
their
weapons
war
,
and
they
fear
to
take
them
up
,
lest
by
any
means
they
shall
sin
;
yea
,
ye
can
see
that
they
fear
to
sin
;
for
behalf
they
will
suffer
themselves
that
they
he
trodden
down
ant
slain
by
their
enemies
,
and
will
not
lift
their
swords
agails
them
;
and
this
beeause
of
their
faith
in
Christ
...
And
nom
because
of
their
steadfastness
when
they
do
believe
in
thai
thing
which
they
do
believe
;
for
because
of
their
firmnes
when
they
are
once
enlightened
,
behold
the
Lord
shall
bles
them
and
prolong
their
days
,
notwithstanding
their
iniquil
:
yea
,
even
if
they
should
dwindle
in
unbelief
,
the
Lord

prolong
their
days
until
the
time
shall
come
which
hath
bet
spoken
of
by
our
fathers
,

That

times

the

and
this
is
according
to
the
prophecy
,
that
they
shall

is

knowledge

which
have

unto
them
which

of

of

can
see
of

,
that

never
would

therefore
,

the
Lord
,

will
not

unto
me
,
saith
the
Lord
.
And
now
behold
,
saith
the
Lord
,
concerning
the
people
of
the
Nephites
,
if
they
will
not
repent
,
and
observe
to
do
my
will
,
I
will
utterly
destroy
them
,
saith
the
Lord
,
because
of
their
anbelief
,
notwithstanding
the
many
mighty
works
which
I
have
done
among
them
;
and
as
surely
as
the
Lord
liveth
,
shall
these
things
be
,
saith
the
Lord
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
which
heard
_
the
words
of
Samuel
,
the
Lamanite
,
which
he
spake
upon
the
walls
of
the
city
.
And
as
many
as
believed
on
his
words
,
went
forth
and
sought
for
Nephi
;
and
when
they
had
came
forth
amd
found
him
,
they
confessed
unto
him
their
sins
and
denied
not
,
desiring
that
they
might
be
haptized
unto
the
Lord
.
But
as
many
as
there
were
which
did
not
believe
in
the
words
of
Samuel
,
were
angry
with
him
;
and
they
cast
stones
at
him
upon
the
wall
,
and
also
many
shot
arrows
at
bim
,
as
he
stood
upon
the
wall
;
but
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
was
with
hii
,
insoMuch
that
they
could
not
hit
him
with
their
stones
,
neither
With
their
arrows
.
Now
when
they
saw
this
,
that
they
could
tot
hit
him
,
there
were
many
more
which
did
believe
on
his
words
,
iisomuch
that
they
went
away
unto
Nephi
to
be
baptized
.
—
For
behold
,
'
Nephi
was
baptizing
,
end
prophesying
,
and
Preaching
,
crying
repentance
unto
the
people
;
shewing
signs
and
wonders
;
working
miracles
among
the
people
,
that
hight
know
that
the
Christ
must
shortly
come
;
telling
[File:454]
of
things
which
must
shortly
come
,
that
they
might
know
and
remember
at
the
time
of
their
coming
,
that
they
had
been
made
known
unto
them
beforehand
,
to
the
intent
that
they
might
believe
;
therefore
as
many
as
believed
on
the
words
of
Sam
uel
,
went
forth
unto
him
to
be
baptized
,
for
they
came

ing
and
confessing
their
sins
,
But
the
more
part
of
them
dil
not
believe
in
the
words
of
Samuel
;
therefore
when
they
saw
that
they
could
not
hit
him
with
their
stones
and
their
arrows
,
they
cried
out
unto
their
captains
.
saying
,
Take
this
fellow
and
bind
him
,
for
behold
,
he
hath
a
Devil
;
and
because
of
the
power
of
the
Devil
which
is
in
him
,
we
cannot
hit
him
with
our
stones
and
our
arrows
;
therefore
take
him
and
bind
him
,
and
away
with
him
.
And
as
they
went
forth
to
lay
their
hands
on
him
,
behold
,
he
did
cast
himself
down
from
the
wall
,
ani
did
flee
out
of
their
lands
,
yea
,
even
unto
his
own
couniry
,
and
began
{o
preach
and
to
prophesy
among
his
own
peo
ple
.
And
behold
,
he
was
never
heard
of
more
among
the
Ne
phites
;
and
thus
were
the
affairs
of
the
people
.
And
thus
ended
the
eighty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
thus
ended
,
also
,
the
eighty
and
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
,
the
more
part
of
the
people
remaining
in
their
pride
and
wickedness
,
and
the
lesser
part
walking
more
circumspectly
before
God
,
And
these
wer
the
conditions
also
,
in
the
eighty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reig
of
the
Judges
.
And
there
were
but
little
alteration
in
the
al
fairs
of
the
people
,
save
it
were
the
people
began
to
be
more
hardened
in
iniquity
,
and
do
more
and
more
of
that
which
was
contrary
to
the
commandments
of
God
,
in
the
eighty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
.
But
it
came
to
pass
in
the
ninetieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
,
there
were
great
signs
given
unto
the
people
,
and
wor
ders
;
and
the
words
of
the
prophets
began
to
be
fulfilled
;
and
angels
did
appear
unto
men
,
wise
men
,
and
did
declare
unto
them
glad
tidings
of
great
joy
;
thus
in
this
year
the
Scriptures
began
to
be
fulfilled
.
Nevertheless
,
the
people
began
to
har
den
their
hearts
,
all
save
it
were
the
most
believing
part
af
them
,
both
of
the
Nephites
,
and
also
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
began
to
depend
upon
their
own
strength
,
and
upon
their
om
wisdom
,
saying
:
Some
things
they
may
have
guessed
right
among
so
many
;
but
behold
,
we
know
that
all
these
great
aul
!
marvellous
works
cannot
come
to
pass
,
of
which
bath
bea
spoken
.
And
they
began
to
reason
and
to
contend
among
themselves
,
saying
,
That
it
is
not
reasonable
that
such
a
beim
[File:455]

as
a
Christ
shall
come
;
if
so
,
and
he
be
the
Son
of
God
,
the
Father
of
Heaven
and
of
earth
,
as
it
hath
been
spoken
,
why
will
he
not
shew
himself
unto
us
,
as
well
as
unto
they
which
shall
be
at
Jerusalem
?
Yea
,
why
will
he
not
shew
himself
in
this
land
,
as
well
as
in
the
land
of
Jerusalem
?
But
behold
,
we
know
that
this
is
a
wicked
tradition
,
which
has
been
handed
down
unto
us
by
our
fathers
,
to
cause
us
that
we
should
believe
in
some
great
and
marvellous
thing
which
.
should
come
fo
pass
,
but
not
among
us
,
but
in
a
land
which
is
far
distant
,
aland
which
we
know
not
;
therefore
they
can
keep
us
in
ignorance
,
for
we
cannot
witness
with
our
own
eyes
that
they
are
true
.
And
they
will
,
by
the
cunning
and
the
mysterious
arts
of
the
evil
one
,
work
some
great
mystery
,
which
we
cannot
understand
,
which
will
kecp
us
down
to
be
servants
to
their
words
,
and
also
servants
unto
them
,
for
we
depend
upon
them
for
to
teach
us
the
word
;
and
thus
will
they
keep
us
in
ignorance
,.
if
we
will
yicld
ourselves
unto
them
all
the
days
of
our
lives
,
And
many
more
things
did
the
people
imagine
up
in
their
hearts
,
which
were
foolish
and
vain
;
and
they
were
much
disturbed
,
for
satan
did
stir
them
up
to
do
iniquity
continually
;
yea
,
he
did
go
about
.
spreading
rumors
and
contentions
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
that
he
might
harden
the
hearts
of
the
people
against
that
which
was
good
,
and
against
that
which
should
come
;
and
notwithstanding
the
signs
and
the
wonders
which
was
wrought
among
the
people
of
the
Lord
,
and
the
many
miracles
which
they
did
,
satan
did
get
great
hold
upon
the
hearts
of
the
people
,
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
.
And
thus
ended
the
ninetieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
thus
ended
the
book
of
Helaman
,
tccording
to
the
record
of
Telaman
and
his
sons

CHAPTER

Jind
Helaman
was
the
son
of
Helaman
,
which
was
the
son
of
Bima
,
which
was
the
son
of
Alma
,
being
descendant
of
Nephi
,
which
was
the
son
of
Lehi
,
which
came
out
of
Jen
salem
in
the
fast
year
of
the
reign
ef
Zedekiah
,
the
king
of
Judah
.
f
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
ninety
and
first
year
had
pas
sed
away
;
and
it
was
six
hundred
years
from
the
time
thi
Lehi
left
Jerusalem
;
and
it
was
in
the
year
that
Lachoneus
was
the
Chief
Judge
and
the
governor
over
the
land
.
And
Nephi
,
the
son
of
Helaman
,
had
departed
out
of
the
Jand
of
Zarahemla
,
giving
charge
unto
his
son
Nephi
,
which
was
his
eldest
son
,
concerning
the
plates
of
brass
,
and
all
the
records
which
had
been
kept
,
and
all
those
things
which
had
been
kept
sacred
,
from
the
departure
of
Lehi
out
of
Jerusalem
:
then
be
departed
out
of
the
land
,
and
whither
he
went
,
no
man
know
eth
;
and
his
son
Nephi
did
keep
the
records
in
his
stead
,
yet
,
the
record
of
this
people
.
:
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
commencement
of
the
mnely
and
second
year
,
behold
,
the
prophecies
of
the
.
prophets
be
gan
to
be
fulfilled
more
fully
;
for
there
began
to
be
greater
signs
and
greater
miracles
wrought
among
the
people
.
Bat
there
were
some
which
began
to
say
,
That
the
time
was
pat
for
the
words
to
he
fulfilled
,
which
was
spoken
by
Samuel
,
the
Lamanite
.
And
they
began
to
rejoice
over
their
brethren
,
sa
ing
,
Behold
,
the
time
is
past
,
and
the
words
of
Samuel
are
not
fulfilled
;
therefore
,
your
joy
and
your
fatth
coneeming
ths
thing
,
hath
been
vain
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
[File:457]
make
a
great
uproar
throughout
the
land
;
and
the
people
which
believed
,
began
to
be
very
sorrowful
,
lest
by
any
means
those
things
which
had
been
spoken
,
might
not
come
to
pass
.
But
behold
,
they
did
watch
steadfastly
for
that
day
,
and
that
night
,
and
that
day
,
which
shall
be
as
one
day
,
as
if
there
were
no
night
,
that
they
might
know
that
their
faith
had
not
been
vain
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
a
day
set
apart
by
the
unbelievers
,
that
all
those
who
believed
in
those
traditions
,
should
be
put
to
death
,
except
the
sign
should
come
to
pass
,
which
had
been
given
by
Samucl
the
prophet
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Nephi
,
the
son
of
Nephi
,
saw
this
wickedness
of
his
people
,
his
heart
was
exceeding
sorrowful
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
went
out
and
bowed
himself
down
upon
the
earth
,
and
cried
mightily
to
his
God
,
in
behalf
of
his
people
;
yea
,
those
which
were
about
to
be
destroyed
because
of
their
faith
in
the
tradition
of
theirfathers
.
And
if
came
to
pass
that
he
cried
mightily
unto
the
Lord
,
all
the
day
;
and
behold
,
the
voice
of
the
Lord
came
unto
him
,
saying
:
Lift
up
your
head
and
be
of
good
cheer
:
for
behold
,
the
time
is
at
hand
,
and
on
this
night
shall
the
sign
be
given
,
and
on
the
morrow
come
I
into
the
world
,
to
shew
unto
the
world
that
T
will
fulfil
all
that
which
I
have
caused
fo
be
spoken
by
the
mouth
ofmy
Holy
Proplets
.
Behold
,
[
come
unto
iny
own
,
to
fulfil
all
things
which
I
have
made
known
unto
the
children
of
men
,
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
,
and
to
do
the
wil
,
both
of
the
Father
,
and
of
the
Son
of
the
Father
,
because
of
me
,
and
of
the
Son
,
because
of
my
flesh
.
And
behold
,
the
time
is
at
hand
,
and
this
night
shall
the
sign
he
given
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
words
which
came
unto
Nephi
,
was
fulfilled
,
according
as
they
had
been
spoken
:
for
behold
,
at
the
going
down
of
the
sun
,
there
was
no
darkness
;
and
the
people
began
to
be
astonished
,
because
(
here
was
no
darkness
when
the
night
came
,
And
there
were
many
which
had
not
—
believed
the
words
of
the
prophets
,
fell
to
the
earth
,
and
became
as
ifthey
were
dead
,
for
they
knew
that
the
great
plan
of
destruction
which
they
had
laid
for
those
who
believed
in
the
word
of
the
prophets
,
had
been
frustrated
;
for
the
sign
whichchad
been
given
was
already
.
at
hand
;
and
they
began
.
to
know
that
the
Son
of
God
must
shoitly
appear
;
yea
,
in
fine
,
all
the
people
upon
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
,
from
the
west
to
the
east
,
both
in
the
lend
north
and
in
the
land
,
seuth
,
Were
so
exceedingly
astonished
,
that
they
fell
to
the
earth
;
for
[File:458]
they
knew
that
the
prophets
had
testified
of
these
things
for
many
years
,
and
that
the
sign
which
had
been
given
,
was
ak
ready
at
hand
;
and
they
began
to
fear
because
of
their
ini
quity
and
theirunbelief
.
And
it
caine
to
pass
that
there
was
no
darkness
in
all
that
night
,
but
it
was
as
light
as
though
it
was
mid
-
day
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
sun
did
rise
in
the
morning
again
,
ace
cording
to
its
proper
order
;
and
they
knew
that
it
was
the
day
that
the
Lord
should
be
born
,
because
of
the
sign
which
had
been
given
,
And
it
bad
come
to
pass
,
yea
,
all
things
,
every
whit
,
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
.
And
it
came
to
pass
also
,
that
a
new
star
did
appear
,
according
to
the
word
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
from
this
time
forth
,
there
began
to
be
lyings
sent
forth
among
the
people
,
by
sa
tan
,
to
harden
their
hearts
,
to
the
intent
that
they
might
,
not
believe
in
those
signs
and
wonders
which
they
had
seen
;
but
notwithstanding
these
lyings
and
deceivings
,
the
more
part
of
the
people
did
belicve
,
and
were
converted
unto
the
Lord
—
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
went
forth
among
the
people
,
and
also
many
others
,
baplizing
unto
repentance
,
in
the
which
,
there
were
a
great
remission
of
sins
.
And
thus
the
people
began
again
to
have
peace
in
the
land
;
and
there
were
no
contentions
,
save
it
were
a
few
that
began
to
preach
,
endeayoring
to
prove
by
the
Scriptures
,
that
it
was
no
more
expedi+
ent
to
observe
the
law
of
Moses
.
Now
in
this
thing
they
did
err
,
having
not
understood
the
Scriptures
.
But
it
came
to
_
pass
that
they
soon
became
converted
,
and
were
convinced
of
the
error
which
they
were
in
:
for
it
was
made
known
unto
them
that
the
law
was
not
yet
fulfilled
,
and
that
it
must
be
fulfilled
in
every
whit
;
yea
,
the
word
came
unto
them
that
it
ust
be
fulfilled
;
yea
,
that
one
jot
nor
tittle
should
not
pass
way
,
till
it
should
all
be
fulfilled
;
therefore
in
this
same
year
,
_
were
they
brought
to
a
knowledge
of
their
error
,
and
did
con
fess
their
faults
.
And
thus
the
ninety
and
second
year
did
pass
away
,
bringing
glad
tidings
unto
the
people
because
of
the
signs
which
did
come
to
pass
,
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophecy
of
all
the
Holy
Prophets
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
ninety
and
third
year
did
also
pass
away
in
peace
,
save
it
were
for
the
Gadianton
robbers
,
which
dwelt
upon
the
mountains
,
which
did
infest
the
land
;
for
so
strong
were
their
holds
and
their
secret
places
,
that
the
people
could
not
overpower
them
;
therefore
they
did
commit
many
murders
,
and
did
do
much
slaughter
among
the
people
[File:459]
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
ninety
and
fourth
year
,
they
began
to
increase
in
a
great
degree
,
because
there
were
many
dissenters
of
the
Nephites
which
did
flee
unto
them
,
which
did
cause
much
sorrow
unto
those
Nephites
which
did
remain
in
the
land
;
and
there
was
also
a
cause
of
much
sorrow
among
the
Lamanites
:
for
behold
,
they
had
many
children
which
did
grow
up
and
began
to
wax
strong
in
years
,
that
they
became
for
themselves
,
and
were
led
away
by
some
which
were
Zoramites
,
by
their
lyings
and
their
flattering
words
,
to
join
those
Gadianton
robbers
;
and
thus
were
the
Lamanitcs
afflicted
also
,
and
began
to
decrease
as
to
their
faith
and
rightcousness
,
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
rising
generation
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
passed
away
the
ninety
and
fifth
year
also
,
and
the
people
began
to
forget
those
signs
and
wonders
which
they
had
heard
,
and
began
to
be
less
and
less
astonished
at
a
sign
or
a
wonder
from
[Iecaven
,
insomuch
that
ihey
began
to
be
hard
in
their
hearts
,
and
blind
in
their
minds
,
and
began
to
disbelieve
all
which
thewhad
heard
and
seen
,
imagining
up
some
vain
thing
in
their
hearts
,
that
it
was
wrought
hy
men
,
and
by
the
power
of
the
Devil
,
to
lead
away
and
deeeive
the
hearts
of
the
people
;
and
thus
did
satan
get
possession
of
the
hearts
of
the
people
again
,
insomuch
that
he
did
blind
their
eyes
,
and
lead
them
away
to
believe
that
the
doctrine
of
Christ
was
a
foolish
and
a
vain
thing
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
began
to
wax
strong
in
wickedness
and
nec
a
and
they
did
not
believe
that
there
should
be
any
more
signs
or
wonders
given
;
and
satan
did
go
about
,
Jeading
away
the
hearts
of
the
people
,
tempting
them
and
causing
them
that
they
should
do
great
wickedness
inthe
land
.
And
thus
did
pass
away
the
ninety
and
sixth
year
5
and
also
the
ninety
and
seventh
year
;
and
also
the
ninety
and
eighth
year
;
and
also
the
nincty
and
ninth
year
;
and
also
an
hundred
years
had
passed
away
,
since
the
days
of
Mosiah
,
which
was
king
over
the
people
of
the
Nephites
.
And
six
hundred
and
nine
years
had
passed
away
,
since
Lehi
left
Jetusalem
;
and
nine
years
had
passed
away
,
from
the
time
which
the
sign
was
given
,
which
was
spoken
of
by
the
pro
yheis
,
that
Christ
should
come
into
the
world
.
Now
the
Nephites
began
to
reckon
their
time
from
this
period
which
the
sign
was
given
,
or
from
the
coming
of
Christ
;
therefore
,
nine
years
had
passed
away
,
and
Neph
,
which
was
the
father
of
Nephi
,
which
had
the
charge
of
the
records
,
did
not
return
to
[File:460]
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
could
no
where
be
found
in
all
the
land
.
r
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
did
still
remain
m
wick
.
edness
,
notwithstanding
the
much
preaching
and
prophesying
which
was
sent
among
then
:
;
and
thus
passed
away
the
tenth
year
also
;
and
the
cleventh
year
also
passed
away
In
iniquity
,
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirteenth
year
,
there
began
to
he
qwars
and
contentions
throughout
all
the
land
:
for
the
Gadian
.
ton
robbers
had
hecomie
so
numerous
,
and
did
slay
so
manyol
the
people
,
and
did
lay
waste
so
many
cities
,
and
did
spread
so
much
death
and
carnage
throughout
the
land
,
that
it
became
expedient
that
all
the
people
,
both
the
Nephites
and
the
La
manites
,
should
take
up
arms
against
them
;
therefore
all
the
Lamanites
which
had
become
convericd
unto
the
Lord
,
did
unite
with
their
brethren
,
the
Nephites
,
and
were
compelled
,
for
the
safety
of
their
lives
,
and
their
women
and
thicir
chil
dren
,
to
take
up
arms
against
those
Gudianton
robbers
;
yea
,
and
also
to
maintain
the
rights
,
and
their
privileges
of
their
church
,
and
of
their
worship
,
and
their
freedom
,
and
their
hierty
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
before
this
thirteenth
year
had
passed
away
,
the
Nephites
were
threatened
with
utter
des
truction
,
because
of
this
war
,
which
had
become
exceeiing
sore
.
And
it
came
to
pass'
that
those
Lamanites
which
hud
united
with
the
Nephites
,
were
numbered
among
the
Nephites
;
and
their
curse
was
taken
from
them
,
and
their
skin
became
white
like
unto
the
Nephites
;
and
their
young
men
and
thei
daughters
became
exceeding
fair
,
aud
they
were
numbered
among
the
Nephites
,
and
were
called
Nephites
.
And
thuset
ded
the
thirteenth
year
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
fourteenth
year
,
the
war
between
the
robbers
and
the
people
of
Nephi
did
continue
,
and
did
become
exceeding
sore
;
nevertheless
the
people
of
Nephi
did
gain
some
advantage
of
the
robherm
,
insomuch
that
they
did
drive
them
back
out
of
their
lands
intt
the
mountains
,
and
into
their
secret
places
.
And
thus
endet
the
fourteenth
year
.
And
in
the
fifteenth
year
they
did
come
forth
again
against
the
people
of
Nephi
;
and
because
of
ft
wickedness
of
the
people
of
Neplii
,
and
theirmany
contentiom
and
dissensions
,
the
Gadianton
robbers
did
gain
many
adval
tages
over
them
.
And
thus
ended
the
fifteenth
year
;
and
thus
were
the
people
in
a
state
of
many
afilictions
;

the
sw

CHAPTER
IL
.
Anp
now
if
came
to
pass
that
in
the
sixteenth
year
from
the
eoningof
Clirist
,
Lachoneus
,
the
Governor
of
the
land
,
recei
yed
an
epistle
from
the
leaders
and
the
Governor
of
this
band
of
robbers
;
and
these
wrre
the
words
which
were
written
,
saying
:
Lachoneus
,
most
noble
and
Chief
Governor
of
the
land
:
behold
I
write
this
epistle
usto
you
,
and
do
give
unto
you
exceeding
great
praise
because
of
your
firmness
,
and
also
the
firmness
of
your
people
,
in
maintaining
that
which
ye
suppose
to
be
your
right
and
liberty
;
yca
,
ye
do
stand
well
,
as
if
ye
were
supported
by
the
hand
of
a
God
,
in
the
defence
of
your
liberty
,
and
your
property
,
and
your
country
,
or
that
which
ye
do
call
so
.
And
it
seemeth
a
pity
unto
.
me
,
most
noble
Lachoneus
,
that
ye
should
be
so
foolish
and
yain
as
to
suppose
that
ye
can
stand
against
so
many
brave
men
,
which
are
at
my
command
,
which
do
now
at
this
time
stand
in
their
amis
,
and
do
await
,
with
great
anxiety
,
for
the
word
,
Godown
upon
the
Nephitcs
and
destroy
them
.
And
I
knowing
of
their
meonquerable
spirit
,
having
proved
them
in
the
field
of
battle
,
and
knowing
of
their
everlasting
hatved
towards
you
,
because
of
the
many
wrongs
which
ye
have
done
unio
them
,
therefore
if
they
should
come
down
against
you
,
they
would
visit
you
with
utter
destruetion
;
therefore
Thave
wrote
this
-
@istle
,
sealing
it
with
mine
own
hand
,
feeling
for
your
wel
fare
,
because
of
your
firmness
in
that
which
ye
believe
to
be
tight
,
end
your
noble
spirit
in
the
field
of
battle
;
therefore
I
mite
unto
you
desiring
that
ye
would
yield
up
unto
this
my
people
,
your
citics
,
your
lands
,
and
your
possessions
,
rather
than
that
they
should
visit
you
with
the
swofd
,
and
that
desuction
should
come
upon
you
;
or
in
other
words
,
yield
Yourselves
up
unto
us
,
and
unite
with
us
,
and
become
in
led
with
our
secret
works
,
and
become
our
brethren
,
that
ye
may
be
like
unto
us
;
not
our
slaves
,
but
our
brethren
,
and
Partners
of
all
our
substance
.
And
behold
,
[
swear
unto
you
,
ise
willdo
this
,
with
an
oath
,
ye
shall
not
be
destroyed
;
hut
ifye
will
not
do
this
,
I
swear
unto
you
,
with
an
oath
,
that
on
the
morrow
month
,
I
will
command
that
my
armies
shall
come
down
against
you
,
and
they
shall
not
stay
their
band
,
and
shall
—
Spare
not
,
but
shall
slay
you
,
and
shall
let
fall
the
sword
upom
you
,
even
until
ye
shall
become
extinct
.
And
behold
,
I
.
4m
Giddianhi
,
and
[
am
the
Governor
of
this
the
secret
society
Gadianton
;
which
society
,
and
the
works
thereof
I
know
[File:462]
to
be
good
;
and
they
are
of
ancient
date
,
and
they
have
ber
handed
down
unto
us
.
And
I
write
this
epistle
unto
you
,
Le
choneus
,
and
I
hope
that
ye
will
deliver
up
your
Jands
,
an]
your
possessions
,
without
the
shedding
of
blood
,
that
this
ny
people
may
recover
their
rights
aud
government
which
hare
disseuted
away
from
you
,
because
of
your
wickedness
inte
taining
from
them
their
rights
of
government
;
and
except
je
do
this
,
1
will
avenge
their
wrongs
.
1
am
Giddianhi
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
when
Lachoneus
received
this
epistle
,
he
was
exceedingly
astonished
,
because
of
the
holt
ness
of
Giddianhi
,
demanding
the
possession
of
the
land
oj
the
Nephites
,
and
also
of
threatening
the
people
,
and
avenging
the
wrongs
of
those
that
had
received
no
wrong
,
save
it
were
.
they
had
wronged
themselves
,
by
dissenting
away
unto
thow
wicked
and
abominable
robbers
.
Now
behold
,
this
Lachone
us
,
the
Governor
,
was
a
just
man
,
and
could
not
be
frightenel
by
the
demands
and
the
threatenings
of
a
robber
;
therefore
he
did
not
hearken
to
the
epistle
of
Giddianhi
,
the
Governord
the
robbers
,
but
he
did
cause
that
his
people
should
ery
uta
the
Lord
for
strength
against
the
time
that
the
robbers
should
come
down
against
them
;
yea
,
he
sent
a
proclamation
among
all
the
people
,
that
they
should
gather
together
their
womel
,
and
.
their
children
,
their
flocks
and
their
herds
,
and
all
thet
substance
,
save
it
were
their
land
,
unto
one
place
.
Andhe
caused
that
fortifications
should
be
built
round
about
thes
and
the
strength
thereof
should
be
exceeding
great
.
And
lt
caused
that
there
should
be
armies
,
both
of
the
Nephites
atl
of
the
Lamanites
,
or
of
all
them
which
were
numbered
a
the
Nephites
,
should
be
placed
as
guards
round
about
,
to
wal
them
,
and
to
guard
them
from
the
robbers
,
day
and
nighl
)
yea
,
he
said
unto
them
,
As
the
Lord
liveth
,
except
ye
repetl
of
all
your
iniqnities
,
and
cry
unto
the
Lord
,
that
they
would
inno
wise
be
delivered
out
of
the
hands
of
those
Gadianlat
robhers
.
And
so
great
and
marvellous
were
the
words
and
prophecies
of
Lachoneus
,
that
they
did
cause
fear
fo
com
upon
all
the
people
,
and
they
did
exert
themselves
in
thet
might
,
to
do
according
to
the
words
of
Lachoneus
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Lachoneus
did
appoint
Chief
Cap
~
tains
over
all
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
,
to
command
them®
the
time
,
that
the
robbers
should
come
down
out
of
thew
}
derness
against
them
,
Now
the
chiefest
among
all
the
Cap
tains
,
and
the
great
Commander
of
all
the
armies
of
the
phites
,
was
appointed
,
and
his
name
was
Gidgiddoni
.
Not
[File:463]
itwas
the
custom
among
all
the
Nephites
,
to
appoint
for
their
Chief
Captains
,
save
it
were
in
their
times
of
wickedness
,
sone
one
that
had
the
spirit
of
revelation
,
and
also
of
prophecy
;
therefore
this
Gidgiddoni
was
a
great
prophet
among
them
,
and
also
was
the
Chief
J
udge
.
Now
the
people
said
uito
Gidgiddoni
,
Pray
unto
the
Lord
,
and
Jet
us
go
up
upon
the
mountains
,
and
into
the
wilderness
,
that
we
may
fall
upon
the
wbbers
and
destroy
them
,
in
their
own
lands
,
But
Gidgiddosisaith
unto
them
,
the
Lord
forbid
;
for
if
we
should
go
up
gainst
them
,
the
Lord
would
deliver
us
into
their
bands
;
therefore
we
will
prepare
ourselves
in
the
centre
of
our
lands
,
and
we
will
gather
all
our
armies
together
,
and
we
will
not
go
aginst
thein
,
but
we
will
wait
till
they
shall
come
against
us
;
therefore
,
as
the
Lord
liveth
,
if
we
do
this
,
he
will
deliver
them
into
our
hands
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventeenth
year
,
in
the
latter
end
of
the
year
,
the
proclamation
of
Lachoweus
had
gone
forth
throughout
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
they
had
taken
their
horses
,
and
their
chariots
,
and
their
cattle
,
ad
all
their
focks
,
and
their
herds
,
and
their
grain
,
and
all
heir
substance
,
and
did
march
forth
by
thousands
,
and
by
fas
of
thousands
,
until
(
hey
had
all
gone
forth
to
the
place
mich
had
been
appointed
,
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
,
to
defend
themselves
aguinst
their
encmie
-.
And
the
lind
which
was
appointed
was
the
land
of
Zaraheuila
,
and
the
ind
which
was
between
the
land
of
Zarahemla
and
the
land
Bountiful
;
yea
,
to
the
line
which
was
between
the
land
Bounlil
and
the
land
Desolation
;
and
there
were
a
great
many
howsand
people
,
which
were
called
Nephites
,
which
did
gaththemselves
together
in
this
Iand
.
Now
Lachoneus
did
fuse
that
they
should

of

curse
which
was
upon

;
and
they
did
fortify
themselves
agvinst
their
uemies
,
and
they
did
dwell
in
one
land
,
and
in
one
body
,
and
bey
did
fear
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
Lachoneinsomuch
that
they
did
repent
of
all
their
sins
;
and
they
id
put
up
their
prayers
unto
the
Lord
their
God
,
that
he
would
deliver
them
in

And
they
were
exceeding
sorwltl
because
of
their
enemy

And
Gidgiddoni
did
cause
they
should
make
weapons
of
war
,
of
every
kind
,
that
they
should

it
came

those

But

there

by

and
there

had

all

and
they
were
in

therefore
there
were
no

the

to

to
obtain

,

,
int
which
time
they
did
bope
to
destroy
the
robbers
from
alli

of

land
.
And
thus
the
eighteenth
year
did
pa
away
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
nineteenth
year
,
Giddia
found
that
it
was
expedient
that
he
should
go
up

against

Nephites
,
for
there
was
no
way
that

save
it
were

;
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
come
up
to
battle
:
#
it
was
in
the
sixth
month
;
and
behold
,
great
and
terrible
the
day
that
they
did
come
up
to
battle
;
and
they
wel
girded
about
after
the
manner
of

;

Giddianhi
,
because
of
their
armour
,
and
because
of
ther
dyed
in
blood
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
cr
Nephites
,
when
they
saw
the
appearance
of
the
army
@
dianhi
,
had
all
fallen
to
the
earth
,
and
did
lift
their
[File:465]
the
Lord
their
God
,
that
he
would
spare
them
,
and
deliver
them
out
of
uc
hoaas
of
their
enemies
.
And
it
came
to
pass
fat
when
the
armics
of
Gaddianhi
saw
this
,
they
began
to
gout
with
a
loud
voice
,
because
of
their
joy
;
for
they
had
supposed
that
the
Nephites
had
fallen
with
fear
,
because
of
theterror
of
their
armies
;
but
in
this
thing
they
were
disapinted
,
for
the
Nephites
did
not
fear
them
,
but
they
did
feax
ther
God
,
and
did
supplicate
-
Him
for
protection
;
therefore
when
the
armies
:
of
Gidcicnhi
did
rush
upon
them
,
they
were
prepared
to
meet
ihem
;
yea
,
in
the
strength
of
the
Lord
they
didreceive
them
;
and
the
battle
commenced
in
this
the
sixth
nonth
;
and
great
and
terrible
was
the
battle
thereof
;
yea
,
geat
and
terrible
was
the
slaughter
thereof
,
insomuch
that
there
never
was
kuown
so
great
@
slaughter
among
all
the
people
of
Lehi
since
he
left
Jerusalem
,
-
And
notwithstandngthe
threatenings
and
the
oaths
which
Giddianhi
had
made
,
behold
,
the
Nephites
did
beat
them
,
insomuch
that
they
did
fil
back
from
before
them
.
;
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Gidgiddoni
commanded
that
his
armes
should
pursue
them
as
far
as
to
the
borders
of
the
wildemess
,
and
that
they
should
not
spare
any
that
should
fall
alo
their
hands
by
the
way
;
and
thus
they
did
pursue
them
,
and
did
slay
them
,
to
the
borders
of
the
wilderness
,
even
antil
they
had
fulfilled
the
commandment
of
Gidgiddoni
,
And
it
came
io
pass
that
Giddianhi
,
who
had
stood
and
foght
with
boldness
,
was
pursucd
as
he
fled
;
and
being
weary
becnuse
of
his
much
fighting
,
he
was
overtaken
and
akin
,
And
thus
was
the
end
of
Giddianhi
,
the
robber
.
_
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
did
refim
again
to
their
place
of
security
.
And
it
came
to
pass
lat
this
nineteenth
year
did
pass
away
,
and
the
robbers
did'
Tot
come
again
to
battle
;
neither
did
they
come
again
in
the
inentieth
year
;
but
in
the
twenty
and
first
year
they
did
not
me
up
to
battle
,
and
they
came
up
on
-
all
sides
to
lay
siege
und
ahout
the
people
of
Nephi
;
for
they
did
suppose
that
if
hey
should
cut
off
the
people
of
Nephi
from
their
lands
,
and
sould
hem
them
in
on
every
side
,
and
if
they
should
cut
them
fom
all
their
outward
privileges
,
that
they
could
cause
to
yield
themselves
up
according
to
their
wishes
.
Now
liad
appointed
unto
themselves
another
leader
,
whose
e
was
Zemnarihah
;
therefore
it
was
Zemnarihah
that
did
ethat
this
siege
should
take
place
.
But
behold
this
was
antage
unto
the
Nephites
;
for
it
was
impessible
for
the
[File:466]
robbers
to
lay
siege
sufficiently
long
to
have
any
effect
upp
the
Nephites
,
because
of
their
much
provision
which
they
hig
laid
up
in
store
because
of
the
scantiness
of
provisions
among
the
robbers
;
for
behold
they
had
nothing
save
it
were
nie
for
theix
subsistence
,
which
meat
they
did
obtain
in
the
yi
derness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
wild
game
becay
scarce
in
the
wilderness
,
insomuch
that
the
robbers
were
abo
to
perish
with
hunger
.
And
the
Nephites
were
continusly
marching
out
by
day
and
by
night
,
and
falling
upon
theirg
.
mies
,
and
cutting
them
off
by
thousands
and
by
tens
of
thy
sands
.
And
thus
it
became
the
desire
of
the
people
of
Za
naribah
,
to
withdraw
from
their
design
,
because
of
the
mes
destruction
which
come
upon
them
by
night
and
by
day
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Zemnarihah
did
give
comma
unto
his
people
,
that
they
should
withdraw
themsclves
five
the
siege
,
and
march
into
the
farthermost
parts
.
of
the
lanl
northward
.
And
now
Gidgiddoni
,
being
aware
of
their
&
sign
,
and
knowing
of
their
weakness
because
of
the
want
food
,
and
the
great
slaughter
which
had
becn
made
amoy
them
,
therefore
he
did
send
out
his
armies
in
the
night
-
lim
and
did
cut
off
the
way
of
their
retreat
,
and
did
place
hist
mics
in
the
way
of
their
retreat
;
and
this
did

by

in

And
the

which
were
on

were
also
cut
off
in
their
places
of
retreat
.
And
all
thee
things
were
done
by
command
of
Gidgiddoni
.
And
thet
were
many
thousands
which
did
yield
themselves
up

unto
the
Nephites

when

they
did

they

came
to
pass
that
they
did
break
forth
,
all
as

,
in
—
[File:467]

praising
their
God
,
for
the
great
thing
which
he
had
done
for
them
,
in
preserving
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
;
yea
,
they
did
cry
,
Hosanna
to
the
Most
High
God
;
and
they
did
cry
,
Blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Lord
God
Almighty
,
the
Most
High
God
,
And
their
hearts
were
swollen
with
joy
,
unto
the
gushing
out
of
many
tears
,
because
ofthe
great
goodness
of
God
in
delivering
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemics
;
and
they
knew
it
was
because
of
their
repentance
and
their
humility
that
they
had
been
deliyered
from
an
everlasting
destruction
.
'
And
now
behold
there
wes
not
a
living
soul
among
all
the
people
of
the
Nephites
,
which
did
doubt
in
the
least
thing
in
the
words
of
all
the
holy
prophets
which
had
spoken
;
for
they
knew
that
it
must
needs
be
that
they
must
be
fulfilled
;
and
they
knew
that
it
must
be
expedicut
that
Christ
had
come
,
because
of
the
many
signs
which
had
been
given
,
according
to
the
words
of
the
propets
;
and
because
of
the
things
which
had
come
to
pass
alrealy
,
they
knew
it
must
needs
be
that
all
things
should
some
to
pass
according
to
that
which
had
been
spoken
;
therefore
they
did
forsake
all
their
sins
,
and
their
abominations
,
ind
their
whoredoms
,
and
did
serve
God
with
all
diligence
,
thy
and
night
.
;
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
taken
all
the
wbbers
prisoners
,
insomuch
that
none
did
escape
which
were
not
slain
,
they
did
cast
their
prisoners
into
prison
,
and
did
tause
the
word
of
God
to
be
preached
unto
them
;
and
as
many
as
would
repent
of
their
sins
and
enter
into
a
covenant
hat
they
would
murder
no
more
,
were
set
at
liberty
;
but
as
many
as
there
were
who
did
not
enter
into
a
covenant
,
and
who
did
still
continue
to
have
those
secret
murders
in
their
learts
;
yea
,
as
many
as
were
found
breathing
out
threatenings
inst
their
brethren
,
were
condemned
and
punished
according
to
the
law
.
And
thus
they
did
put
an
end
to
all
those
Weked
,
and
secret
,
and
abominable
combinations
,
in
the
Thich
there
were
so
much
wickedness
,
and
so
many
murders
tommitted
,
And
thus
had
the
twenty

passed
Stray
,
and
the
twenty

year
also
,
and
the
twenty

the

CHAPTER
III
.
Axb
now
it
came
fo
pass
-
that
the
people
of
tae
Nephites
aid
all
return
to
their
own
lands
,
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
,
every
man
,
with
his
family
,
his
flocks
and
his
herds
,
his
horses
and
his
cattle
,
and
all
things
whatsoever
did
belong
unto
them
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
had
not
eaten
up
all
their
protisions
;
therefore
they
did
take
with
them
all
that
they
had
not
devoured
,
of
all
their
grain
of
every
kind
,
and
their
gold
,
ad
their
silver
,
and
all
their
precious
things
,
and
they
did
refam
to
their
own
lands
and
their
possessions
,
both
on
the
north
and
on
the
south
,
both
on
the
land
northward
and
on
the
land
southward
,
And
they
granted
unto
those
robbers
which
tad
entered
into
a
covenant
.
to
keep
the
peace
,
of
the
band
which
were
desirous
to
remain
Lamanites
,
lands
,
according
to
iit
numbers
,
that
they
might
have
,
with
their
labors
,
wherewith
to
subsist
upon
;
and
,
thus
they
did
establish
peace
in
all
the
land
.
And
they
began
again
to
prosper
and
(
o
wax
great
;
id
the
twenty
and
sixth
and
seventh
years
passed
away
,
and
here
was
great
order
in
the
land
;
and
they
had
forned
their
}
laxs
according
to
equity
and
justice
.
And
now
there
was
lothing
in
all
the
land
,
to
hinder
the
people
from
prospering
continually
,
except
they
should
fal]
into
transgression
.
And
4
how
it
was
Gidgiddom
,
and
the
Judge
Lachoneus
,
and
those
which
had
been
appointed
leaders
,
which
had
established
this
gteat
peace
in
the
land
.
ay
_
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
cities
built
anew
,
and
there
were
man
'y
old
cities
repaired
;
and
there
were
man
iy
highways
cast
up
,
and
many

roads
made
,
which
led
from

,
and
from

to

and

from
place
to

.
And
bus
passed
avway
the
twenty
and
eighth
year
,
and
the
people

continual
peace
.
But
it
came
to
he
twenty
and
[File:470]
hy
ninth
year
,
there
began
to
be
some
disputings
among
the
peo

were

unto

boastings

cause
of
their
excecding
great
riches
,
yea
,
even
unto
great
persecutions
:,
for
there
were
many
merchants
in
the
land
,
and
also
many
lawyers
,
and
many
officers
.
And
the
people
began
to
be
distinguished
by
ranks
,
according
to
their
riches
,
and
their
chances
forlearning
;
yea
,
some
were
ignorant
because
of
their
poverty
,
and
others
did
receive
great
learning
because
af
their
riches
;
some
were
lifled
up
in
pride
,
and
others
wer
exceeding
humble
;
some
did
return

,
while
others
would
receive
railing
,
and
persecution
,
and
all
manner
of
afflictions
,
and
would
not
turn
and
revile
again
,
but
were
humble
and
penitent
before
God
;
and
thus
there
became
a
great
inequality
in
all
the
land
,
insomuch
that
the
chureli
he
gan
to
be
broken
up
;
yea
,
insomuch
that
in
the
thirtieth
year
the
church
was
broken
up
in
all
the
land
,
sayc
it
were
among
a
few
of
the
Lamanites
,
which
were
converted
unto
the
tne
faith
;
and
they
would
not
depart
from
it
,
for
they
were
fim
,
and
steadfast
,
and
immoyeable
,
willing
with
all
dihgence
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
.
Now
the
cause
of
this
iniquity
of
the
people
,
was
this
:
Satan
had
great
power
,
unto
the
stitring
up
of
the
people
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
,
aul
to
the
puffing
them
up
with
pride
,
tempting
them
to
seek
far
power
,
and
authority
,
and
riches
,
and
the
vain
,
things
of
the
world
,
And
thus
satan
did
lead
away
the
hearts
of
the
peo
~
ple
,
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
;
therefore
they
had
not
em
joyed
peace
but
a
{cw
years
.
And
thus
in
the
commencemell
of
the
thirtieth
year
,
the
people
haying
been
delivered
upia
the
space
of
a
long
time
,
to
be
carried
about
by
the
temptations
of
the
Devil
whithersoever
he
desired
to
carry
them
,
and
to
do
whatsoever
iniquity
he
desired
they
should
;
and
thus
in
the
coramencement
of
this
,
the
thiztieth
ycar
,
they
were
in
a
sialt
of
awful
wickedness
,
Now
they
did
not
sin
ignorantly
,
fot
they
knew
the
will
of
God
concerning
them
,
for
it
had
beet
ught
unto
them
;
therefore
they
did
wilfully
rebel
again
God
.
And
now
it
was
in
the
days
of
Lachoneus
,
the
son
af
Lachoneus
:
for
Lachoneus
did
fill
the
seat
of
his
father
,
at
did
govern
the
people
that
year
.
And
there
began
to
bem@
inspired
from
heaven
,
and
sent
forth
,
standing
among
the
pee
~ple
in
-
all
the
land
,
preaching
and
testifying
boldly
of
the
sin
aridyiniquitics
of
the
people
,
and
testifying
unto
them
concer
theredemption
which
the
Lord
would
make
for
his
pe
rin
other
words
,
the
resurrection
of
Christ
;
and
they
[File:471]
tid
testify
boldly
of
his
death
and
sufferings
.
Now
there
were
many
of
the
people
which
were
exceeding
angry
,
because
of
those
which
testified
of'
these
things
;
and
those
which
were
angry
,
were
chiefly
the
Chief
Judges
,
and
they
which
had
been
High
Priests
,
and
lawyers
;
yca
,
all
they
which
were
lawyers
,
were
angry
with
those
which
testified
of
these
things
.
Now
there
was
no
lawyer
,
nor
Judge
,
nor
High
Priest
,
that
could
have
power
to
condemn
any
one
to
death
,
save
their
condemnation
was
signed
by
the
governor
of
the
land
,
Now
there
were
many
of
those
which
testified
of
the
things
pertaining
to
Christ
,
which
testified
boldly
,
which
were
taken
and
put
to
death
secretly
,
by
the
Judges
,
that
the
knowledge
of
their
death
came
not
unto
the
governor
of
the
land
,
until
after
their
death
.
Now
behold
,
this
was
contrary
to
the
laws
of
the
land
,
that
any
man
should
be
put
to
death
,
except
they
had
power
from
the
governor
of
the
land
;
therefore
a
complaint
came
up
.
unto
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
to
the
governor
of
the
land
,
against
these
Judges
which
had
condemned
the
prophets
of
the
land
unto
death
,
not
avcording
to
the
law
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
taken
and
brought
up
before
the
Judge
,
to
be
judged
of
the
crime
which
they
had
done
,
according
to
the
law
which
had
been
given
by
the
peoples
New
it
came
to
pass
that
those
J
udges
had
many
friends
and
kindreds
;
and
the
remainder
,
yea
,
even
almost
all
the
lavyers
and
the
High
Priests
,
did
gather
themsclyes
together
,
and
unite
with
the
kindreds
of
those
Judges
which
were
to
be
—
tied
according
to
the
law
;
and
they
did
enter
into
a
covenant
one
with
another
,
yea
,
even
into
that
covenant
which
was
given
,
by
them
of
old
,
which
covenant
was
given
and
administered
by
the
Devil
,
to
combine
against
all
righteousness
;
therefore
they
did
combine
against
the
people
of
the
Lord
,
and
enter
in0a
covenant
to
destroy
them
,
and
to
deliver
those
which
were
Suilly
of
murder
from
the
grasp
of
justice
,
which
was
about'to
he
administered
according
to
the
Jaw
.
And
they
did
set
at
—
defiance
the
law
and
the
rights
of
their
country
;
and
they
did
Sovenant
,
one
with
another
,
to
destroy
the
governor
,
and
to
estiblish
a
king
over
the
land
,
that
the
land
should
no
more
be
aliberty
,
but
should
be
subject
unto
kings
.
Now
behold
,
I
Will
shew
:
unto
you
that
they
did
nof
establish
a
king
over
the
lind
;
but
in
this
same
year
,
yea
,
the
thirtieth
year
,
they
did
destroy
upon
the
judgement
seat
,
yea
,
did
murder
the
Chief
Judge
of
the
land
.
And
the
people
were
divided
one
against
Mother
;
and
they
did
separate
one
from
another
,
tribes
,
¥
[File:472]
every
man
according
to
his
family
,
and
his
kindred
and
friends
;
and
thus
they
did
destroy
the
government
of
the
land
.
And
every
tribe
did
appoint
a
Chief
,
or
a
leader
over
them
;
and
thus
they
became
tribes
,
and
leaders
of
tribes
.
Now
behold
,
there
was
no
man
among
them
,
save
he
lad
much
family
and
many
kindreds
and
friends
;
therefore
.
their
tribes
became
exceeding
great
.
Now
all
this
was
done
,
and
there
was
no
wars
as
yet
among
them
;
and
all
this
iniquity
had
come
upon
the
people
,
because
they
did
yicld
themselves
unto
the
power
of
satan
;
and
the
regulations
of
the
goverment
was
destroyed
,
because
of
the
secret
combination
of
the
friends
and
kindreds
of
them
which
murdered
the
prophets
.
And
they
did
cause
a
great
contention
in
the
land
,
insomuch
that
the
more
right
cous
part
of
the
people
,
although
they
were
nearly
all
become
wicked
;
yea
,
there
were
but
few
righteous
men
among
them
.
And
thus'
six
years
had
not
passed
away
,
since
the
more
part
of
the
people
had
turned
from
their
righteousness
,
like
the
dog
to
his
vomit
,
or
like
the
sow
to
her
wallowing
in
the
mire
.—
©
Now
this
secret
combination
which
had
brought
so
great
ink
quily
upon
the
people
,
did
gather
themselves
together
,
and
did
place
at
their
head
a
man
whom
they
did
call
Jacob
;
and
they
did
call
him
their
king
;
therefore
he
became
a
king
over
tis
wicked
band
;
and
he
was
one
of
the
chicfesat
which
had
giver
his
voice
against
ihe
prophets
which
testified
of
Jesus
—
ya
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
not
so
strong
in
number
/
as
the
tribes
of
the
people
which
were
united
together
,
save
it
_
were
their
-
leaders
did
establish
their
laws
,
every
one
acca
ding
to
his
tribe
;
nevertheless
they
were
enemies
,
notwith
standing
they
were
not
a
rightcous
people
;
yet
they
were
unr
ted
in
the
hatred
of
those
who
had
entered
into
a
covenant
destroy
the
government
;
thercfore
Jacob
seeing
that
their
eneinies
were'
more
numerous
than
they
,
he
being
the
king
of
the
bandy
therefore
he
commanded
his
people
that
they
should
take
their
flight
into
the
northernmost
part
of
the
land
,
and
there
build
up
unto
themselves
a
kingdom
,
until
they
weit
joined
by
dissenters
,
(
for
he
flattered
them
that
there
would
be
many
dissenters
,)
and
they
become
sufficiently
strong
contend
withthe
tribes
of
the
people
.
And
they
did
s0
;
and
so
speedy
was
their
march
,
that
it
could
not
be
impeded
,
ue
til
they
had
gone
forth
out
of
the
reach
of
the
people
.
thus
ended
the
thirtieth
year
;
and
thus
were
the
affairs
of
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirty
and
first
year
,
that
tbey
[File:473]
were
divided
into
tribes
,
every
man
according
to
his
family
,
kindred
and
frieuds
;
nevertheless
,
they
lad
come
to
an
agreement
that
they
would
not
go
to
war
one
with
another
;
but
they
were
not
united
as
to
their
laws
,
and
their
manner
of
governinent
,
for
they
were
established
according
to
the
minds
of
them
which
was
their
chiefs
and
their
leaders
.
But
they
did
establish
very
strict
laws
that
onc
tribe
should
not
trespass
against
another
,
imsomuch
that
in
some
degree
they
had
peace
in
the
land
;
nevertheless
,
their
hearts
were
turned
from
the
Jord
their
God
,
and
they
did
stone
the
prophets
,
and
did
cast
them
out
from
among
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
,
having
been
visited
by
angels
,
and
also
by
the
voice
of
the
Lord
,
therefore
having
seen
angels
,
and
being
eyewitness
,
and
having
had
power
given
unto
him
that
he
might
know
concerning
the
ministry
of
Christ
,
and
also
beg
eyewitness
to
their
quick
return
from
righteousness
unto
their
wickedness
and
abominations
;
therefore
,
heing
grieved
for
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
,
and
the
blindness
of
their
minds
,
went
forth
among
them
in
that
same
year
,
and
began
to
testify
holdly
,
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
through
faith
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
.
And
he
did
minister
many
things
unto
them
;
and
all
of
them
cannot
be
written
,
and
apart
of
them
would
not
suffice
;
therefore
they
are
not
written
in
this
book
.
And
Nephi
did
minister
with
power
and
with
great
authority
,
s
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
angry
with
him
,
eve
because
he
had
greater
power
than
they
,
for
it
were
not
possible
that
they
could
disbelieve
his
words
:
for
so
great
was
his
faith
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
,
that
angels
did
:
minister
unto
him
daily
;
and
in
the
name
of
Jesus
did
he
cast
out
devils
and
unclean
spirits
;
and
even
his
brother
did
he
raise
from
the
dead
,
after
he
had
been
stoned
and
suffered
death
by
the
people
;
and
the
people
saw
it
,
and
did
witness
of
it
,
and
Were
angry
with
him
,
because
of
his
power
;
and
he
did
also
do
many
more
miracles
,
in
the
sight
of
the
people
,
in
the
name
of
Jesus
,
And
it
came
to
pas'
that
the
thirty
and
first
year
did
pass
way
,
and
there
were
but
few
which
were
converted
unto
the
nd
;
but
as
many
as
were
converted
,
did
truly
signify
unto
the
people
that
they
had
been
visited
by
the
power
and
spirit
of
God
,
which
was
in
Jesus
Christ
,
in
whom
they
believed
.—
And
as
many
as
had
devils
cast
out
from
them
,
and
were
healed
of
their
sicknesses
and
their
infirmities
,
did
traly
manifest
[File:474]
unto
the
people
that
they
had
been
wrought
upon
by
the
spini
of
God
,
and
had
been
healed
;
and
they
did
shew
forth
signg
also
,
and
did
do
some
miracles
among
the
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
passed
away
the
thirty
and
second
year
also
,
And
Nephi
did
ery
unto
the
people
in
the
commencement
of
thi
:
thirty
and
third
year
;
and
he
did
preach
unto
them
repentance
and
remission
of
sins
,
Now
J
would
have
you
to
remember
also
,
that
there
were
none
which
were
brought
unto
repentance
,
who
were
not
baptized
with
water
;
therefore
there
were
ordained
of
Nephi
,
men
unto
this
ministry
,
that
all
such
as
should
come
unto
them
,
should
be
baptized
with
water
,
and
this
as
a
witness
and
a
testimony
before
God
,
and
unto
the
people
,
that
they
had
repented
and
received
a
remis

sion
of
their
sins
.
And
there
were
many
in
the
commence

ment
of
this
year
,
that
were
baptized
unto
repentance
;
and
thus
the
more
part
of

AND
now
it
came
to
pass
that
according
to
our
record
,
and
we
know
ourrecord
to
be
true
:
for
behold
,
it
was
a
just
man
which
did
keep
the
record
;
for
he
truly
did
many
miracles
in
e
name
of
Jesus
;
and
there
was
not
any
man
which
could
doa
miracle
in
the
name
of
Jesus
,
save
he
were
cleansed
cvery
whit
from
his
iniquity
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
,
if
there
was
no
mistake
made
by
this
man
in
the
reckoning
of
our
time
,
the
thirty
and
third
year
had
passed
away
,
and
the
people
began
to
look
with
great
.
earnestness
for
the
sign
which
had
been
given
by
the
prophet
Samuel
,
the
Lamanite
;
yea
,
for
the
time
that
there
should
be
darkness
for
the
space
of
three
days
,
over
the
face
of
the
land
.
And
there
began
to
be
great
doubt
ings
and
disputations
among
the
people
,
notwithstanding
8
many
signs
had
been
given
.
Aud

month
,
in
the
fourth
day
of
the
month
,
there
arose
a
great
storm
,
such
an
one
as
never
had
been
known
in
all
the
land
5
and
there
was
also
a
great
and
terrible
tempest
;
and
there
was
terrible
thunder
,
insomuch
that
it
did
shake
the
whole
earth
as
if
it
was
about
to
divide
asunder
;
and
there
was
&
ceeding
sharp
lightnings
,
such
as
never
had
been
known
in
all
the
land
.
And
the
city
of
Zarahemla
did
take
fire
:
and
the
[File:475]
city
of
Moroni
did
sink
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
,
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
were
drowned
;
and
the
earth
was
carried
up
upon
the
city
of
Moronihah
,
that
in
the
place
of
the
city
thereof
,
there
became
a
great
mountain
;
and
there
was
a
great
and
tertible
destruction
in
the
land
southward
.
But
behold
,
there
was
a
more
great
and
terrible
destruction
in
the
tand
northward
:
for
behold
,
the
whole
face
of
the
land
was
changed
,
because
of
the
tempest
,
and
the
whirlwinds
,
and
the
thunderings
,
and
the
lightnings
,
and
the
execeding
great
quaking
of
the
whole
earth
;
and
the
highways
were
broken
up
,
and
the
level
roads
were
spoiled
,
and
many
smooth
places
became
rongh
,
and
many
great
and
notable
cities
were
sunk
,
and
many
were
burned
,
and
masy
were
shook
till
the
buildings
thereof
had
fallen
to
the
earth
,
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
were
slain
,
and
the
places
were
left
desolate
;
and
there
were
some
citics
which
remained
;
but
the
damage
thereof
was
exceeding
great
,
and
there
were
many
in
them
which
were
slain
;
and
there
were
some
which
were
carried
away
in
the
whirlwind
;
and
whither
they
went
,
no
man
knoweth
,
save
they
know
that
they
were
carried
away
;
and
thus
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
betame
deformed
,
because
of
the
tempests
,
and
the
thunderings
,
and
the
lightnings
,
and
the
quaking
of
the
earth
.
And
behold
,
the
rocks
were
rent
in
twain
;
yea
,
they
were
broken
up
upon
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
,
insomuch
that
they
were
found
in
broken
fragments
,
and
in
seams
,
and
in
cracks
,
upon
all
the

face
of
the
land

And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
thunderings
,
and
the
—
lightnings
,
and
the
storm
,
and
the
tempest
,
and
the
quakings
ot

they
did
Jast
for
about
the
space
of
three
hours
;
and
it
was
said
by
sonte
that
the
time
Was
greater
;
nevertheless
,
all
these
great
and
terrible
things
were
done
in
about
the
space
of
three
hours
;
and
then
behold
,
there
was
darkness
upon
the
face
of
{he

And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
thick
darkness
upon
the
face
of
all
the
land
,
insomuch
that
the
inhabitants
thereof
whicli
had
not
fallen
,
could
feel
the
vapour
of
darkness
;
and
there
_
could
be
no

because
of
the
darkness
,
neither

neither
torches

neither
could
there
be

kindled
with
P
fine
and
exceeding
dry

so
that
there
could
not
be

neither

in

were

to

mourn
,
saying
:
O

the
loss
of
their

.
And
it
came
fo

that
thus
did
the
three
days
pass
away
.
And
it
was
inthe

,
ant

And
thus

were
the
wriptures
fulfilled
,
which
had
been
spoken
by

,—
And
it
was
the
more
righteous
part
of
the
people
which
were

,
and
it
was
they
which
received
the

,
and
stoned
them
not
;

it
was
they
which
had
not
shed
the
blood
of

,
which
were
spared
;

they
were
spared
,
and

;
and
they
were
not®
trowned
in
the
depths
of

;
and
they
were
not
burned
by

neither
were
they

And
it

with

,
they
heard'a
yoice
,
as
if
it

and
they
cast
their
eyes
round

and
it
was
not

centre
,
insomuch
that

Verily
,
verily
I
say
unto
thee
,
thou
shalt
by
no
means
come
out
thence
,
until
thou
hast
paid
the
uttermost
senine
.—
And
while
ye
are
in
prison
,
can
ye
pay
even
one
senine
?
Verily
,
verily
Tsay
unto
you
,
Nay
,
Behold
,
it
is
written
by
them
of
old
time
,
that
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
;
but
I
say
unio
you
,
That
whosoever
looketh
on
a
woman
,
to
lust
after
her
,
hath
committed
adultery
already
in
his
heart
.
Behold
,
I
give
nfo
you
a
commandment
,
that
ye
suffer
none
of
these
things
to
enter
into
your
heart
:
for
it
is
better
that
ye
should
deny
yourselves
of
these
things
,
wherein
ye
will
take
up
your
cross
,
than
that
ye
should
be
cast
into
hell
.
It
hath
been
written
,
That
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
,
let
him
give
her
a
writing
of
divorcement
.
Verily
,
verily
I
say
unto
you
,
That
whosoever
shall
put
away
his
wife
,
saving
for
the
cause
of
fornication
,
causeth
her
to
commit
adultery
;
and
whoso
shall
marry
ber
who
is
divorced
,
committeth
adultery
.
And
again
itis
written
,
Thou
shalt
aot
forswear
thyself
,
but
shalt
perform
unto
the
Lord
thine
oaths
.
But
verily
,
verily
1
say
unto
you
,
Swear
not
at
all
;
neither
by
Heaven
,
for
it
is
God's
throne
;
nor
by
the
earth
,
for
it
his
footstool
;
neither
shalt
thou
swear
by
the
head
,
because
thou
canst
not
make
one
hair
black
or
white
;
but
let
your
communication
be
Yea
,
yea
;
Nay
,
nay
:
for
whatsoever
cometh
of
more
than
these
are
evil
.
And
behold
,
itis
written
,
An
eye
foran
cye
,
and
a
tooth
foratooth
.
But}
say
unto
you
,
That
ye
shall
not
resist
evil
:
but
whosoever
sigllsmite
dee
on
thy
right
cheek
,
turn
to
him
the
other
also
.
Avid
if
any
man
will
sue
thee
at
the
law
,
and
take
away
thy
coat
,
let
him
have
thy
cloak
also
.
And
whoscever
shall
compthee
to
goa
mile
,
go
with
him
twain
,
Give
to
him
that
asketh
thee
,
and
to
him
that
would
borrow
of
thee
,
turn
thou
nolaway
.
And
behold
,
it
is
written
also
,
That
thou
shalt
love
hyneighbor
,
and
hate
thine
enemy
:
but
bchold
I
say
unto
you
,
Love
your
cnemies
,
bless
them
that
curse
you
,
do
good
to
them
thet
hate
you
,
and
pray
for
them
which
despitefully
use
you
ad
persecute
you
,
that
ye
may
be
the
children
of
your
Father
which
is
in
heaven
:
for
he
maketh
his
sun
to
rise
on
the
©
eiland
on
the
good
;
therefore
those
things
which
were
of
oid
time
,
which
were
under
the
law
in
me
,
are
all
fulfilled
.
—
Ol
things
are
done
away
,
and
all
things
have
become
new
;
therefore
I
would
that
ye
should
be
perfect
even
as
J
,
or
your
Pather
which
is
in
Heaven
is
perfect
.
Verily
,
verily
,
I
say
that
I
would
that
ye
should
do
alms
unto
the
poor
;
but
take
d
that
ye
do
not
your
alms
before
met
,
10
be
seen
of
then
:
[File:486]
otherwise
ye
have
no
reward
of
your
Father
which
is
in
heaven
,
Therefore
,
when
yc
shall
do
yorr
alms
,
do
not
sound
a
trumpet
before
you
,
as
will
hypocrites
do
in
the
synagogues
,
and
in
the
streets
,
that
they
may
have
glory
of
men
.
Verily
,
Tsay
unto
you
,
They
have
their
reward
.
Bat
when
thou
doest
alm
let
not
thy
left
hand
know
what
thy
right
hand
doeth
;
that
thine
alms
may
be
in
secret
:
and
thy
Father
which
seeth
in
secret
,
himself
shall
reward
thee
openly
.
And
when
thou
prayest
,
thou
shalt
not
do
as
the
hypocrites
:
for
they
love
to
pray
standing
in
the
synagogues
,
and
in
the
corners
of
the
strecis
,
that
they
may
be
scen
of
men
.
Verily
,
Tsay
unto
you
,
They
have
their
reward
.
But
thou
,
when
thou
prayest
,
enter
into
thy
closet
,
and
when
thou
hast
shut
thy
door
,
pray
to
thy
Father
which
is
in
secret
;
and
thy
Father
which
seeth
in
secret
,
shall
reward
thee
openly
.
But
whe
ye
pray
,
use
not
vain
repetitions
,
as
the
heathen
:
for
they
think
that
they
shall
be
heard
for
their
much
speaking
,
Be
not
ye
therefore
like
unto
them
:
for
your
Father
knowelh
what
things
ye
have
need
of
before
ye
ask
him
.
After
tlis
manner
therefore
pray
ye
:
Our
Father
which
art
in
heaven
,
Hallowed
be
thy
name
.
Thy
will
be
done
in
carth
as
it
ism
heaven
.
And
forgive
us
our
debts
,
as
we
forgive
our
debtor
And
Jead
us
not
into
temptation
,
but
deliver
us
from
evil
.
For
thine
is
the
kingdom
,
and
the
power
,
and
the
glory
,
for
even
Amen
.
For
,
if
ye
forgive
men
their
trespasses
,
your
heavenly
Father
will
also
forgive
you
:
butif
ye
forgive
not
men
their
trespasses
,
neither
will
your
Father
forgive
your
trespasses
.
Moreover
,
when
ye
fast
,
be
not
as
the
hypocrites
,
of
a
sal
countenance
:
for
they
disfigure
theit
faces
,
that
they
may
a
pear
unto
men
to
fast
.
Verily
,
1
say
unto
you
,
They
have
their
reward
.
But
thou
,
when
thou
fastest
,
anoint
thy
heat
,
and
wash
thy
face
;
that
thou
appear
not
unto
men
,
to
fast
,
but
unto
thy
Father
,
which
is
in
secret
:
and
thy
Father
,
which
seeth
in
secret
,
shall
reward
thee
openty
.
Lay
not
up
for
yourselves
treasures
upon
earth
,
where
moll
and
rust
doth
corrupt
,
and
thieves
break
through
and
steal
:
but
lay
up
for
yourselves
treasures
in
heaven
,
where
neither
moth
nor
rust
doth
corrupt
,
and
where
thieves
do
not
drek
through
nor
steal
.
For
where
your
treasure
is
,
there
will
yout
heart
be
aleo
.
The
light
of
the
body
is
the
eye
:
if
therefor
thine
eye
be
single
,
thy
whole
body
shall
be
full
of
light
.
But
if
thine
eye
be
evil
,
thy
whole
body
shall
be
full
of
darkne#
If
therefore
the
light
that
is
in
thee
be
darkness
,
how
great
'
[File:487]

that
darkness
!
No
man
can
serve
two
masters
:
for
either
he
will
hate
the
one
,
and
love
the
other
:
or
else
he
will
hold
to
the
one
,
and
despise
the
other
.
Ye
cannot
serve
God
and
mammon
,
CHAPTER
VL
AND
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
spoken
these
words
,
he
looked
upon
the
twelve
whom
he
had
chosen
,
and
saith
unto
them
,
Remember
the
words
which
I
have
spoken
,
For
behold
,
ye
are
they
which
I
have
chosen
to
minister
unto
this
people
.
Therefore
1
say
unto
you
,
Take
no
thought
for
your
life
,
what
ye
shall
eat
,
or
what
ye
shall
drink
;
nor
yet
for
your
body
,
what
ye
shall
put
on
.
Is
not
the
life
more
than
meat
,
and
the
body
than
raiment
?
Behold
the
fowls
of
the
air
:
tor
they
sow
not
,
neither
do
they
reap
,
nor
gather
into
buns
;
yet
your
heavenly
Father
feedeth
them
:
Are
ye
not
much
better
than
they
?
Which
of
you
by
taking
thought
can
add
one
cubit
unto
his
stature
?
And
why
take
ye
thought
for
raiment
?
Consider
the
lilies
of
the
ficld
how
they
grow
;
they
toil
not
,
neither
do
they
spin
;
and
yet
I
say
unto
you
,
That
even
Solomon
,
in
all
his
glory
,
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
these
,
Wherefore
,
if
God
so
clothe
the
grass
of
the
field
,
which
to-day
is
,
and
to
-
morrow
is
cast
into
the
oven
,
even
so
will
he
clothe
you
,
if
ye
are
not
of
little
faith
.
Therefore
take
No
thought
,
saying
,
What
shall
we
eat
?
or
,
what
shall
we
drink
?
or
,
wherewithal
shall
we
be
clothed
?
For
your
heaynly
Pather
knoweth
that
ye
have
need
of
all
these
things
,
—
Bat
seek
ye
first
the
kingdom
of
God
,
and
his
righteousness
,
and
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
you
.
Take
therefore
no
thought
for
the
morrow
:
forthe
morrow
shall
take
thought
for
the
things
of
itself
.
Suflicient
is
the
day
unto
the
evil
thereof
,
J
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
spoken
tl
ae
Words
,
he
turned
again
to
the
multitade
,
and
did
open
his
tiouth
unto
them
again
,
saying
,
Verily
,
verily
,
T
say
unto
you
,
tidge
-
not
,
that
ye
be
not
judged
.
For
with
what
judgement
Ye
judze
,
ye
shall
be
judged
:
and
with
what
measure
ye
mete
,
itshall
be
measured
to
you
again
.
And
why
beholdest
thou
the
mote
that
is
in
thy
brother's
eye
,
but
considerest
not
the
that
is
in
thine
own
eye
?.
Or
how
wilt
thou
say
to
thy
a
[File:488]
brother
,
Let
me
pull
out
the
mote
out
of
thine
eye
;
and
behold
,
a
beam
is
in
thine
own
eye
?
hou
hypocrite
,
firs
:
cast
out
the
beam
out
of
thine
own
eye
;
and
then
shalt
thou
sec
clearly
to
cast
out
the
mote
out
of
thy
brother's
eye
.
Give
not
that
which
is
holy
unto
the
dogs
,
neither
cast
ye
your
pearls
before
swine
,
lest
they
trample
them
under
their
feet
,
and
turn
again
and
rend
you
.
Ask
,
and
it
shall
be
given
unto
you
;
seek
,
and
ye
shall
find
;
knock
,
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you
:
for
every
one
that
asketh
,
receiveth
;
and
he
that
seeketh
,
findeth
;
and
to
him
that
knocketh
,
it
shall
be
opened
.
Or
what
man
is
there
of
you
,
whom
,
if
his
son
ask
bread
,
will
he
give
hima
stone
?
Or
if
he
ask
a
fish
,
will
he
give
him
a
serpent
?
If
ye
then
being
evil
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
unto
your
children
,
how
much
more
shall
your
Father
which
is
in
heaven
give
good
things
o
them
that
ask
him
?
Therefore
all
things
whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
,
do
ye
even
so
to
them
:
for
this
is
the
law
and
the
prophets
.
Enter
ye
iu
at
the
straight
gate
;
for
wide
is
the
gate
,
and
broad
is
the
way
,
that
Jeadeth
to
destruction
,
and
many
ther
be
which
go
in
thereat
:
because
,
straight
is
the
gate
,
and
narrow
is
the
way
,
which
leadeth
unto
life
,
and
few
there
he
that
find
it
.
Beware
of
false
prophets
,
which
come
to
you
ia
sheep's
clothing
,
but
inwardly
they
are
ravening
wolves
,
Ye
shall
know
them
by
their
fruits
:
Do
men
gather
grapes
of
thorns
,
or
figs
of
thistles
?
Even
so
every
good
tree
bringeth
forth
good
fruit
;
but
a
corrupt
tree
bringeth
forth
evil
{ruil
A
good
tree
cannot
bring
forth
evil
fruit
,
neither
a
corrupt
tree
pring
forth
good
fruit
,
Every
tree
that
bringeth
not
forth
goo
!
fruit
,
is
hewn
down
,
and
cast
juto
the
fire
.
Wherefore
,
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
.
Not
every
one
that
saith

CHAPTER
VII

Axp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
ended
these
sayings
,
he
cast
his
eyes
round
about
on
the
multitude
,
and
saith
unto
them
,
Behold
,
ye
have
heard
the
things
which
I
have
taught
before
I
ascended
to
my
Father
;
therefore
whose
remembereth
these
sayings
of
mine
,
and
doeth
them
,
him
will
Traise
up
at
the
last
day
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
said
these
words
,
he
perceived
that
there
were
some
among
them
which
maryelled
,
and
wondered
wat
he
would
concerning
the
law
of
Moses
:
for
they
understood
not
the
saying
,
That
old
things
had
passed
away
,
and
that
all
things
had
become
new
.
And
he
saith
unto
them
,
Marvel
not
that
Isaid
unto
you
,
that
old
things
had
passed
away
,
and
that
all
things
had
become
new
.
Behold
I
say
unfo
you
,
That
the
law
is
fulfilted
that
was
given
unto
Moses
.
Behold
,
lam
he
that
gave
the
law
,
and
Tam
he
which
covenanted
with
my
people
israel
;
therefore
,
the
law
in
me
is
fulfilled
:
for
I
have
come
to
fulfil
the
law
;
thereforc
,
it
hath
an
end
.
Behold
,
I
do
not
destroy
the
prophets
:
for
as
many
as
have
not
been
fulfilled
in
me
,
verily
,
I
say
unto
you
,
shall
all
be
fulfilled
.
And
beeause
I
said
unto
you
,
That
old
things
hath
passed
away
,
I
do
not
destroy
that
which
hath
been
spoken
concerning
things
which
is
to
come
.
For
behold
,
the
covenant
which
I
have
made
with
my
people
,
is
not
all
fulfilled
;
but
the
law
which
Was
given
unto
Moses
,
hath
an
end
in
me
.
Behold
,
I
am
the
law
,
and
the
light
:
Look
unto
me
,
and
endure
to
the
end
,
and
ye
shall
live
:
for
unto
him
that
endureth
to
the
end
,
will
I
give
eternal
life
.
Behold
,
I
have
given
unto
you
the
com
-—
mandments
;
therefore
kecp
my
commandments
.
And
this
is
the
law
and
the
prophets
:
for
they
truly
testified
of
me
.
:
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
spoken
these
Words
,
he
said'
unto
those
twelye
whom
he
had
chosen
,
Ye
are
_8y
disciples
;
and
ye
are
a
light
unto
this
people
,
which
are
a
remnant
of
the
house
of
Joseph
.
And
behold
,
this
is
the
land
[File:490]
:
of
your
inheritance
;
and
the
Father
hath
given
it
unto
you
—
And
not
at
any
time
hath
the
Father
given
me
commandiment
that
I
should
tell
it
unto
your
brethren
at
Jerusalem
;
neither
at
any
time
hath
the
Father
given
me
commandment
,
that
should
tell
unto
them
concerning
the
other
tribes
of
the
house
of
Israel
,
which
the
Father
hath
Jed
away
out
of
the
land
—
This
much
did
the
Father
command
me
,
That
I
should
tell
unto
them
,
that
other
sheep
I
heye
,
which
are
not
of
this
told
;
them
also
I
must
bring
,
and
they
shall
hear
my
voice
;
and
there
shall
be
one
fold
,
and
one
shepherd
.
And
now
hecuuse
of
stiffneckedness
and
unbelief
,
they
understood
not
ary
word
;
therefore
I
was
commanded
to
say
no
more
of
the
Father
con
cerning
this
thing
unto
them
.
Bust
,
verily
,
[say
unto
you
,
that
the
Father
hath
commended
me
,
and
f
tell
it
unto
you
,
that
ye
were
separated
from
among
them
because
of
their
migmty
;
therefore
it
is
because
of
their
miquity
.
thet
they
know
not
of
you
.
And
verily
,
I
say
unto
you
again
,
That
the
othey
tribes
hath
the
father
separated
from
them
;
and
it
is
beeanse
of
heir
iniquity
,
that
they
know
not
of
them
,
An
Ay
wnie
you
,
That
ye
are
they
of
which
T
said

,
which
are
not
of
this
fold
;
them
also
T
must
br
{she
shall
hear
my
voice
;
and
there
shall
be
one
fold
,
axl
one
shepherd
.
.
And
they
understood
me
not
,
for
they
sujposed
it
had
been
the
Gentiles
:
for
they
understocd
uot
thet
the
Gentiles
should
be
converted
through
their
preaching
;
and
they
understood
me
not
that
f
seid
they
shall
hear
my
voire
;
and
they
understood
me
not
that
the
Gentiles
should
noi
at
any
time
hear
my
voice
;
that
T
should
not

raysell
unto
them
,
save
it
were
by
the
Holy
Ghost
.
But
behold
,
ye
have
both
heard
my
voice
,
and
secn
me
;
and
ye
are
my
sheep
,
and
ye
are
numbered
among
them
which
the
Pathor
hath

And

verily

[say
unto

,
Thet
I
have
other

,
which

of
Jen

;
neither
in
any
parts
of
that
land
round

whither
Thave

For
they
of
which
I

,
are
they
which
have
not
as
yet
heard
my
voice
;
neither
have
I
at
any
time
manifested
myself
unto
them
.
But
I
have
received
6
commandment
of
the
Father
,
That
I
shall
go
unto
them
,
and
that
they
shall

that
there
may
be

therefore
I
go
to
shew
myself
unto
them
.
Any

the
Father
in

name
,
that
they
may
reccive
a
knowledge
of
you
by
the
Holy
Ghost
,
and
also
of
the
other
tribes
which
they

,
that
these

forth
upon

because
of

lief
,
may
he
brought
in
,
or
may
be

to
a
knowledge
of
me
,
their
Redeemer
.
And
then
will

gather
them
in
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
carth
;
and
then
will
J
fulfil
the
covenant
which
the
Father
hath
made
unto
all
the
people
of
the
house
of
Isracl
.
And
blessed
are
the
Gentiles
,
because
of
their
belief
in
me
,
in
and
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
which
witness
unto

Behold

O

in

shall
the
truth
come
unto
the
Gentiles
,
that
the

things
shall
be
made
known
unto
them
.
But
Wo

saith
the
Father
,
unto
the
unbelieving
of
the
Gentiles
:
for
notwithstanding
that
ihey
have
come
forth
upon

face
of

,
and
have
scattered
my
people

which

,
have
been
cast
out
from

and
have
been
trodden
under

;
and
because
of
the
mercies
of
the
Father
unto
the
Gentiles
,
and
also
the

of
the
Father
upon

That

And
thus

When

Benoxy
,
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
spokes
these
words
,
he
looked
round
about
again
on
the
multitude
,
and
he
saith
unto
them
,
Behold
,
my
time
is
at
hand
.
I
per
ceive
that
ye
are
weak
,
that
ye
cannot
understand
all
my
worl
which
I
am
commanded
of
the
Father
to
speak
unto
you
#
this
time
;
thercfore
,
go
ye
unto
your
homes
,
and
ponder
updk
the
things
which
I
have
said
,
and
ask
of
the
Father
,
in
my
name
,
that
ye
may
understand
;
and
prepare
your
minds
for
the
morrow
,
and
1
come
unto
you
again
.
But
now
I
go
unto
the
Father
,
and
also
to
shew
myself
unto
the
lost
tribes
of
I
rael
:
for
they
are
not
Jost
unto
the
Father
,
for
he
knowell
whither
he
hath
taken
them
.
i
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
thu®spoken
,
he
east
his
eyes
round
about
again
on
the
multitude
,
and
hebeld

[File:493]
they
were
in
tears
,
and
did
look
steadfastly
upon
him
,
as
it
they
would
ask
him
to
tarry
a
little
longer
with
them
.
And
he
saith
unto
them
,
Behold
,
my
bowels
is
filled
with
compassion
towards
you
:
Have
ye
any
that
are
sick
among
you
,
bring
themhither
.
Iave
ye
any
that
are
lame
,
or
blind
,
or
halt
,
or
maimed
,
or
leprous
,
or
that
are
withered
,
or
that
are
deaf
,
or
that
are
afflicted
in
any
manner
,
bring
them
hither
,
and
I
will
heal
them
:
for
I
have
compassion
upon
you
;
my
bowels
is
filled
with
mercy
:
for
]
perceive
that
ye
desire
that
[
should
shew
unto
you
what
I
have
done
unto
your
brethren
at
Jerustlem
:
for
I
see
that
your
faith
is
sufficient
,
that
I
should
heal
you
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
thus
spoken
,
all
the
multitude
,
with
one
accord
,
did
go
forth
,
with
their
sick
,
and
their
afflicted
,
and
their
lame
,
and
with
their
blind
,
and
with®
their
dumb
,
and
with
all
they
that
were
afflicted
in
any
manner
;
and
he
did
heal
them
every
one
as
they
were
brought
forth
unto
him
;
and
they
did
all
,
both
they
which
had
been
healed
,
and
they
which
were
whole
,
bow
down
at
his
feet
,
and
did
worship
him
;
and
as
many
as
could
come
for
the
juilfitude
did
kiss
his
feet
,
insomuch
that
they
did
bathe
his
feet
with
their
tears
.
s
}
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
commanded
that
their
liitle
children
should
be
brought
.
So
they
brought
their
little
children
and
sat
them
down
upon
the
ground
round
about
him
,
and
Jesus
stood
in
the
midst
;.
and
the
multitude
gave
way
til
they
had
all
been
brought
unto
him
,
And
it
came

when

,
and
Jesus
stood
in

,
he
commanded
the

that
they
should
kneel
down
upon

ground
.
And
it
came
to

that
when
they
tad
knelt
upon

ground
,
Jesus
groaned
within
himself
,
and
saith
,
Father
,
I
am
troubled
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
of
the
house

And
when
he
had
said
these
words
,
he
himself
also
knelt

upon
the
carth
;
and
behold
he
prayed
unto
the
Father
;
and
the
things
which
he
prayed
,
cannot
be
written
,
and
the
multitude
did
bear
record

heard

And
it
came
to

that
when

had
made
an

of

unto

he
arose
;

so

was
the

And

And

And
it
came
to

that
when

,
he
touched

his

,
even
until
he

spake
unto
them
as
he
touched
them
;
and
the
multitude
heard
not
the
words
which
he
spake
,
therefore
they
did
not
bear
record
;
but
the
disciples
bear
record
that
he
gave
them

Ghost

And
I

it
came

that
when

had
touched
them
all
,
there
came
a
cloud
and
overshadowed
the
multitude
,
that
they
could
not
see
Jesus
.
And
while
they
were
oversha~

,
he
departed
from
them
,
and
ascended
into

And
the
disciples
saw
and
did

that
he

CHAPTER
IX
.
Ayp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
ascended
into
Heaven
,
the
multitude
did
disperse
,
and
every
man
did
take
his
wife
and
his
children
,
and
did
return
to
his
own
home
,
And
it
was
noised
abroad
among
the
people
immediitely
,
before
it
was
yet
dark
,
that
the
multitude
had
seen
Jesus
,
and
that
he
had
ministered
unto
them
,
and
that
he
would
also
show
himself
on
the
morrow
unto
the
multitude
;
yea
,
and
even
all
the
night
it
was
noised
abroad
concerning
Jesus
;
and
insomuch
did
they
send
forth
unto
the
people
,
that
there
were
many
,
yea
,
an
exceeding
great
number
did
labor
exceedingly
al
that
night
,
that
they
might
be
on
the
morrow
in
the
place
where
Jesus
should
shew
himself
unto
the
multitude
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
,
when
the
multifade
was
gathered
together
,
behold
Nephi
and
his
brother
,
whom
he
had
raised
from
the
dead
,
whose
name
was
Timo+
thy
,
and
also
his
son
,
whose
name
was
Jonas
,
and
also
Mathoni
,
and
Mathonihah
,
his
brother
,
and
Kumen
,
and
Kumehouhi
,
and
Jeremiah
,
and
Shemnon
,
and
Jonas
,
and
Zedekiah
,
and
Isaiah
:
Now
these
were
the
names
of
the
disciples
whom
Jesus
had
chosen
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
forth
[File:498]
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
multitude
.
And
ebotd
the}
multitude
was
so
great
,
that
they
did
cause
that
they
shoul
be
separated
into
twelve
bodies
.
And
the
twelve
did
teag
the
multitude
;
and
behold
,
they
did
cause
that
the
multitude
should
kneel
down
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
,
and
should
pry
unto
the
Father
,
m
the
name
of
Jesus
.
And
the
disciples
dif
pray
unto
the
Father
also
,
in
the
name
of
Jesus
.
And
it
eume
to
pass
that
they
arose
and
ministered
unto
the
people
.
And
when
they
had
ministered
those
same
words
which
Jesua
had
spoken
—
nothing'
varying
from
the
words
which
Jesus
hai
spoken
—
behold
,
they
knelt
again
,
and
prayed
to
the
Fatherin
the
name
of
Jesus
;
and
they
did
pray
for
that
which
the
most
desired
;
and
they
desired
that
the
Holy
Ghost
shoul
be
given
unto
them
.
And
when
they
had
thus
prayed
,
they
went
down
unto
the
water's
edge
,
and
the
multitude
followed
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
went
down
into
the
water
,
and
was
baptized
.
And
he
came
up
out
of
the
wate
,
and
began
to
baptize
.
And
he
baptized
al
)
they
whom
Jear
had
chosen
.
And
it
came
to
pass
when
they
were
all
baptzed
,
and
had
come
up
out
of
the
water
,
the
Holy
Ghost
did
fall
upon
them
,
and
they
were
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost
,
and
with
fire
.
And
behold
,
they
were
encircled
about
as
if
if
wer
fire
;
and
it
came
down
from
heaven
,
and
the
multitude
did
witness
it
,
and
do
bear
record
;
and
angels
did
come
dow
aut
of
heaven
,
and
did
minister
unto
them
.
And
it
camet
pass
that
while
the
angels
were
ministering
unto
the
disciples
,
behold
,
Jesus
came
and
stood
in
the
midst
,
and
ministered
unto
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
spake
unto
the
mk
titude
,
and
commanded
them
that
they
should
kneel
dom
again
upon
the
earth
,
and
also
that
his
disciples
should
kned
down
upon

And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
all
knelt
down
upon
the
earth
,
he
commanded
his
disciples
thit
they
should
pray

And
behold
,
they
began
to
pray
;
and
they
did
pray
unto
Jesus
,
calling
hm
their
Lord
and
their
God
.
And
it
.
came
to
pass
that
Jesus
departed
ont
of
the
midst
of
them
,
and
wenta
little
way
off
from
them
and
bowed

to

and
he
saith
,
Father

I

thou

and
they
pray
unto
me
;
and
they

And
now
Father
,
I
pray
unto
thee
for

,
and
also
for
all

that
I
may
be
in
them
as
thou
,
Father
,
art
in
me
,
that
we
may
be
one
,
And
it
came
to
pass
,
that
when
Jesus
had
thus
prayed
unto
ihe
Father
,
he
came
unto
his
disciples
,
and
behold
they
did
will
continue
,
without
ceasing
,
to
pray
unto
him
;
and
they
did
jot
multiply
many
words
,
for
it
was
given
unto
them
what
hey
should
pray
,
and
they
were
filled
with
desire
.
And
it
tame
to
pass
that
Jesus
blessed
them
,
as
they
did
pray
unto
him
,
and
his
countenance
did
smile
upon
them
,
and
the
light
ifhis
countenance
did
shine
upon
them
,
and
behold
they
were
is
white
as
the
countenance
,
and
also
the
gammenis
of
Jesus
;
and
behold
the
whiteness
thereof
did
exceed
all
the
whiteness
,
yea
,
even
there
could
be
nothing
upon
earth
so
white
as
the
whiteness
thereof
,
And
Jesus
saith
unto
them
,
Pray
on
,
nevatheless
they
did
not
cease
to
pray
.
And
he
turned
from
them
again
,
and
went
a
little
way
off
,
and
bowed
himself
to
the
earth
;
and
he
prayed
again
unto
the
Father
,
saying
:
Father
,
I
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
purified
those
which
I
bave
chosen
,
because
of
their
faith
,
and
1
pray
for
them
,
and
dso
for
them
which
shall
believe
on
their
.
words
,
'
that
they
may
be
purified
in
me
,
through
faith
on
their
words
,
even
as
they
are
purified
in
me
.
Father
,
I
pray
not
for
the
world
,
lat
for
them
which
thou
hast
given
unto
me
out
of
the
world
,
because
of
their
faith
,
that
they
may
be
purified
in
me
,
that
J
my
be
in
them
as
thou
,
Father
,
art
in
me
,
that
we
may
be
one
,
that
{
may
be
glorified
in
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
spake
these
wonds
,
he
came
again
unto
his
disciples
,
and
behold
they
did
pay
steadfastly
,
without
ceasing
,
unto
him
;
and
he
did
smile
lyon
then
again
;
and
behold
they
were
white
,
even
as
Jesus
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
went
again
a
little
way
off
,
and
prayed
unto
the
Father
;
and
tongue
cannot
speak
the
words
which
he
prayed
,
neither
can
be
written
by
man
the
words
Which
he
prayed
.
And
the
multitude
did
hear
,
and
do
bear
Teor
,
and
their
hearts
were
open
,
and
they
did
understand
intheir
hearts
the
words
which
he
prayed
,
Nevertheless
,
so
grat
and
wnarvellous
were
the
words
which
he
prayed
,
that
they
cannot
be
written
,
neither
can
they
be
utttered
by
man
.
Anikst
eame
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
made
an
end
of
praying
,
he
came
again
to
the
disciples
,
end
saith
unto
[File:500]
them
,
So
great
faith
have
1
never
secn
among
all
the
Jews
:
wherefore
I
could
not
shew
unto
them
so
great
miracles
,
be
.
cause
of
their
unbelief
.
Verily
I
say
unto
you
,
there
are
nape
of
them
that
have
seen
so
great
things
as
ye
have
seen
;
ne
.
ther
have
they
heard
so
-
great
things
as
ye
have
heard
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
commanded
the
multitude
that
they
should
cease
to
pray
,
and
also
his
disciples
.
And
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
cease
to
pray
in
ther
hearts
.
And
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
arise
and
stand
up
upon
their
feet
.
And
they
arose
up
and
stood
upon
their
feet
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
break
bread
again
,
and
blessed
it
,
and
gave
to
the
disciples
to
eat
.
And
when
they
had
eat
,
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
break
bread
,
and
give
unto
the
multitude
.
And
when
they
had
giyen
unto
the
multitude
,
he
also
gave
them
wine
to
drink
,
and
commanded
them
that
they
should
give
unio
the
multitude
,
Now
there
had
been
no
bread
,
neither
wine
,
brought
by
the
disciples
,
neither
by
the
multitude
;
but
he
truly
gave
unio
them
bread
to
eat
,
and
also
wine
to
drink
;
and
he
saith
unio
them
,
Hc
that
eatheth
this
bread
,
eatheth
of
my
body
to
their
soul
,
and
he
that
drinketh
of
this
wine
,
drinketh
of
my
blood
to
their
soul
,
and
their
soul
shall
never
hunger
nor
thirst
,
but
shall
be
filled
.
Now
when
the
multitude
had
all
eat
and
drank
,
behold
they
were
filled
with
the
spirit
,
and
they
di
cry
out
with
one
voice
,
and
gave
glory
to
Jesus
,
whom
they
both
saw
and
heard
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
ther
had
all
given
glory
unto
Jesus
,
he
saith
unto
them
,
Behold
now
I
finish
the
commandment
which
the
Father
hath
coir
manded
me
concerning
this
people
,
which
are
a
remnantol

Ye

.
And
verily

1
say
unto

that
whet

shall
be

,
then
is
the
fulfilling
of
the

O

And

And
I
say
unto

,
that

repent
after
the
blessing
which
they
shall
receive
,
after
thi
[File:501]
they
have
scattered
my
people
,
then
shall
ye
which
are
a
remnant
of
the
house
of
Jacob
,
go
forth
among
them
;
and
ye
shall
be
in
the
midst
of
them
,
which
shall
be
many
;
and
ye
shall
be
among
them
,
as
a
lion
among
the
beasts
of
the
forest
,
and
as
a
young
lion
among
the
flocks
of

who
,
if
he
goeth
through
,
both
treadeth
down
and
teareth
in
pieces
,
and
none

deliver
.
Thy
hand
shall
be
lifted
up
upon
thine
adversanes
,
and
all
thine
enemies
shall
be
cut
off
And
I
will
gather
wy
people
together
,
as
a
man
gathereth
his
sheaves
into
the
floor
:
for
I
will
make
my
people
with
whom
the
Father
hath
eovenanted
,
yea
,
I
will
make
thy
horn
iron
,
and
I
will
make
thy

.
And
thou
shalt
beat
in
pieces
many
people
;
and
will
consecrate
their
gain
unto
the
Lord
,
and
their
substance
unto
the
Lord
of
the
whole
earth
.
And
behold
,
T
am
he
which
doeth
it
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
,
saith
the
Father
,
That
the
sword
of
my
justice
shalt
hang
over
them
at
that
day
;
and
except
they
repent
,
it
shall
fall
upon
them
,
saith
the
Father
,
yea
,
even
upon
all
the
nations
of
the
Gentilcs
.—
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
I
will
establish
my
people
,
O
house
of
Isracl
,
And
behold
,
this
people
will
I
establish
in
this
land
,
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
covenant
which
I
made
with
your
Father
Jacob
;
and
it
shall
be
a
new
Jerusalem
.
And
the
powers
of
heaven
shal]
be
in
the
midst
of
this
people
;
yea
,
even
1
will
be
in
the
midst
of
you
.
Behold
,
Iam
he
of
whom
Moses
spake
,
saying
:
A
prophet
shall
the
Lord
your
God
tulse
up
unto
you
of
your
brethren
,
like
untome
:
him
shall
ye
hear
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
shall
say
unto
you
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
every
soul
which
will
not
hear
that
prophet
,
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
the
people
.
Verily
,
I
say
unto
you
,
Yea
;
and
all
the
prophets
from
Samuel
,
and
those
that
follow
afier
,
as
many
as
have
spoken
,
have
testified
ofme
.
And
behold
,
ye
are
the
children
of
the
prophets
;
and
ye
are
of
the
house
of
Isracl
;
and
ye
are
of
the
covenant
which
the
Father
made
with
your
fathers
,
saying
:
Unto
Abraham
,
aud
in
thy
seed
,
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
blessed
:
the
Father
having
raised
me
wp
unto
you
first
,
and
sent
me
to
Hess
you
,
in
turning
away
every
on@
of
you
from
his
iniquihes
;
and
this
because
ye
are
the
children
of
the
covenant
,—
And
after
that
ye
were
blessed
,
then
fulfilleth
the
Father
the
venani
which
he
made
with
Abraham
,
saying
:
In
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindveds
of
the
earth
be
blessed
,
unto
the
pouring
out
of
the
Holy
Ghost
through
me
upon
the
Gentiles
,
which
ee
upon
the
Gentiles
,
shall
make
them
mighty
above
all
,
[File:502]
unto
the
scattering
of
my
people
,
O
house
of
Israel
;
and
they
shall
be
a
scourge
unto
the
people
of
thisland
.
Nevertheless
,
when
they
shall
have
received
the
fulness
of
my
Gospel
,
then
if
they
shall
harden
their
hearts
against
me
,
J
will
return
theip
iniquities
upon
their
own
heads
,
saith
the
Father
.
And
I
wil
remember
the
covenant
which
have
made
with
my
people
:
and
Ihave
covenanted
with
them
,
that
i
would
gather
them
together
in
mine
own
duc
time
;
that
{
would
give
unto
them
again
the
land
of
their
fathers
,
for
their
inheritance
,
which
is
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
which
is
the
promised
land
unto
then
forever
,
saith
the
Father
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
time
cometh
,
when
tle
fulness
of
my
gospel
shall
be
preached
unto
them
,
and
they
shall
believe
in
me
,
that
1
am
Jesus
Christ
,
the
Son
of
God
,
and
shall
pray
unto
the
Father
in
my
name
.
Then
shall
ther
watchmen
lift
up
their
voice
;
and
with
the
voice
together
shall
they
sing
:
for
they
shall
see
eye
to
cye
-
Then
will
the
Pr
ther
gather
them
together
again
,
and
give
unto
them
Jerus
Jem
for
the
land
of
their
inheritance
.
Then
shall
they
break
forth
into
joy
—
sing
together
,
ye
waste
places
of
Jerusalem
:
for
the
Father
hath
comforted
his
people
,
he
hath
redeemed
Jerusalem
.
The
Father
hath
made
bare
his
holy
arm
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
nations
:
and
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
shall
se
the
salvation
of
the
Father
;
and
the
Father
and
I
are
one
And
then
shall
be
brought
to
pass
that
which
is
writen
:
Awake

and
put

O

Verily

(
his

marred
more
than

and
his

more
than

so
shall
he
sprinkle
many
nations
;
the
kings
shall
shut
their
mouths
at
him
:
for
that
which
had
been
told
them
shall

and

All

And

Bur
if
they
will
repent
,
and
hearken
unto
my
words
,
and
harden
not
their
hearts
,
I
will
establish
my
church
among
them
,
and
they
shall
come
in
unto
the
covenant
,
and
be
numbered
among
this
the
remnant
of
Jacob
,
unto
whom
1
have
given
this
land
for
their
inheritance
,
and
they
shall
assist
my
people
,
the
remant
of
Jacob
;
and
also
,
as
many
of
the
house
of
Israel
as
shall
come
,
that
they
may
build
a
city
,
which
shall
”
be
called
the
New
Jerusalem
;
and
then
shall
they
assist
my
people
that
they
may
be
gathered
in
,
which
are
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
in
unto
the
New
Jerusalem
.
And
then
shall
the
power
of
heaven
come
down
among
them
;
and
T
also
will
be
in
the
midst
:
and
then
shall
the
work
of
the
Father
commence
,
at
that
day
even
when
this
Gospel
shall
be
preached
among
the
remnant
of
this
people
.
Verily
,
1
say
unto
you
,
At
that
day
shall
the
work
of
the
Father
commence
among
all
the
dispersed
of
my
people
;
yea
,
even
the
tribes
which
have
been
lost
,
which
the
Father
hath
led
away
out
of
Jerusalem
.
Yea
,
the
work
shall
commence
among
all
the
dispersed
of
my
people
,
with
the
Father
,
to
prepare
the
way
whereby
they
may
come
unto
me
,
that
they
may
call
on
the
Father
in
my
name
;
yea
,
and
then
shall
the
work
commence
,
with
the
Father
,
among
all
nations
,
in
preparing
the
way
wherchy
his
people
may
be
gathered
home
to
the
land
of
their
inheritance
.
And
they
shall
go
out
from
all
nations
;
and
they
shall
not
go
out
in
haste
,
nor
go
by
flight
:
for
I
will
go
before
them
,
saith
the
Father
,
and
I
will
be
their
rereward
.
And
then
shall
that
which
is
written
come
to
pass
,
Sing
,
O
barren
,
thou
that
didst
not
bear
;
break
forth
into
singing
,
and
cry
aloud
,
thou
that
didst
not
travail
with
child
:
for
more
are
the
children
of
the
desolate
than
the
children
of
the
married
wife
,
saith
the
Lord
,
Enlarge
the
place
of
thy
tent
,
and
let
them
stretch
forth
the
curtains
of
thy
habitations
;
spare
not
,
lengthen
thy
cords
,
and
strengthen
thy
stakes
;
for
thou
shalt
break
:
forth
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
;
and
thy
seed
shall
in
herit
the
Gentiles
;
and
make
the
desolate
cities
to
be
inhabited
.
Fear
not
;
for
taou
shalt
not
be
ashamed
:
neither
be
thouconfounded
:
for
thou
shalt
not
be
put
to
shame
:
for
thou
shalt
forget
the
shame
of
thy
youth
,
and
shalt
not
remember
the
re_
proach
of
thy
widowhood
any
more
.
For
thy
Maker
,
thy
husband
,
The
Lord
of
hosts
is
his
name
;
and
thy
Redeemer
,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
;
The
God
of
the
whole
earth
shall
he
i
ae
.
[File:506]
be
called
,
For
the
Lord
hath
called
thee
as
a
woman
forsg
.
ken
and
grieved
in
spirit
,
and
a
wile
of
youth
,
when
thou
wast
refused
,
saith
thy
God
.
For
a
small
moment
have
I
forsaken
thee
;
but
with
great
mercies
will
I
gather
thee
.
Ina
litle
wrath
I
hid
my
face
from
thee
for
a
moment
;
but
with
ever
lasting
kindness
will
I
have
merey
on
thee
,
saith
the
Lord
thy
Redeemer
.
For
this
,
the
waters
of
Noah
unto
me
:
foras
Ihave
sworn
that
the
waters
of
Noah
should
no
more
go
over
the'
earth
,
so
have
I
sworn
that
I
would
not
be
wroth
with
thee
,
For
the
mountains
shall
depart
,
and
the
hills
be
removed
;
but
my
kindness
shall
not
depart
from
thee
,
neither
shall
the
cove
.
nant
of
my
people
be
removed
,
saith
the
Lord
that
hath
merey
on
thee
.
O
thou
afflicted
,
tossed
with
tempest
,
and
not
comforted
!
behold
,
Iwill
lay
thy
stones
with
fair
colors
,
and
Jay
thy
foundations
with
sapphires
.
And
I
will
make
thy
windows
of
agates
,
and
thy
gates
of
carbuncles
,
and
all
thy
borders
of
pleasant
stones
.
And
all
thy
children
shall
be
.
tanght
of
the
Lord
;
and
great
shall
be
the
peace
of
thy
children
.
In
righteousness
shalt
thou
be
established
:
thou
shalt
be
far
from
oppression
;
for
thou
shalt
not
fear
:
and
from
terror
;
for
it
shall
not
come
near
thee
.
Behold
,
they
shall
surcly
gather
together
against
thee
,
not
by
me
:
whosoever
shall
gather
together
against
thee
shall
fall
for
thy
sake
.
Behold
,
I
have
created
the
smith
that
blowceth
the
coals
in
the
fire
,
and
that
bringeth
forth
an
instr
ment
for
his
work
;
and
I
have
created
the
waster
to
destroy
.
No
weapon
that
is
formed
against
thee
shall
prosper
;
and
every
tongue
that
shall
rise
against
thee
in
judgement
thou
shalt
condemn
.
This
.
is
the
heritage
of
the
servants
of
the
Lord
,
and
their
righteousness
is
of
me
,
saith
the
Lord
.
And
now
behold
I
say
unto
:
you
,
That
ye
had
ought
to
search
these
things
.
Yea
,
a
commandment
I
give
unto
you
,
that
ye
search
these
things
diligently
:
for
great
is
the
words
of
Isaiah
.
For
surely
he
spake
as
touching
all
things
concerning
my
people
which
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
;
therefore
it
must
needs
be
that
he
must
speak
also
to
the
Gentiles
,
And
all
things
that
he
spake
,
hath
been
,
and
shall
be
,
even
according
to
the
words
which
he
spake
.
Therefore
give
heed
to
my
words
:
wrile
the
things
which
Ihave
told
you
;
and
according
to
the
time
and
the
will
of
the
Father
,
they
shall
go
forth
unto
the
Gettiles
.
And
whosoever
will
hearken
unto
my
words
,
and
re
penteth
,
and
is
baptized
,
the
same
shall
he
saved
.
Search
the
prophets
:
for
many
there
be
that
testify
of
these
things
.
[File:507]
And
nowit
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
said
these
words
,
he
saith
unto
them
again
,
aftcr
he
had
expounded
all
the
Scriptures
uito
them
which
they
had
received
,
he
saith
unte
then
,
Behold
,
other
Scriptures
I
would
that
ye
should
write
,
that
ye
have
not
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
saith
anto
Nephi
,
Bring
forth
the
record
which
ye
have
kept
.
And
when
Nephi
had
brought
forth
the
records
,
and
laid
them
before
him
,
he
cast
his
eyes
upon
them
,
and
saith
,
Verily
,
¥
say
unto
you
;
I
commanded
my
servant
Samuel
,
the
Lamanite
,
that
he
should
testify
unto
this
people
,
that
at
the
day
that
the
Father
should
glorify
his
name
in
me
,
that
there
were
many
saints
which
should
arise
from
the
dead
,
and
should
ap
ar
unto
many
,
and
should
minister
unto
them
.
And
he
saith
unto
them
,
Were
it
not
so
?
And
his
disciples
answered
him
and
said
,
Yea
,
Lord
,
Samuel
did
prophesy
according'
to
thy
words
,
and
they
were
all
fulfilled
.
And
Jesus
saith
unto
them
,
How
be
it
that
ye
have
not
written
this
thing
,
that
many
saints
did
arise
and
appear
unto
many
,
and
did
minister
unte
them
?
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephiremembered
that
this
thing
had
not
been
written
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Jesus
commanded
that
it
should
be
written
;
therefore
it
was
written
secording
as
he
commanded
.
CHAPTER
XI
.
Axp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
expounded
al
the
Scriptures
in
one
,
which
they
had
written
,
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
teach
the
things
which
he
had
ex
:
pounded
unto
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
commanded
hem
that
they
should
write
the
words
which
the
Father
had
given
unto
Malachi
,
which
he
should
tell
unto
them
.
And
it
Came
to
pass
that
after
they
were
written
,
he
expounded
them
,
4nd
these
are
the
words
which
he
did
tell
unto
them
,
saying
:
Thns
said
the
Father
unto
Malachi
:
Behold
,
I
will
send
my
tessenger
,
and
he
shall
prepare
the
way
before
me
;
and
the
lond
,
whom
ye
seek
,
shall
suddenly
come
to
his
temple
,
even
he
messenger
of
the
covenant
,
whom
ye
delight
in
:
behold
,
de
shall
come
,
saith
the
Lord
of
hosts
.
But
who
may
abide
the
day
of
his
coming
?
and
who
shall
stand
when
he
appearth
?
for
he
is
like
a
refiner's
fire
,
and
like
fallers'
soap
.
And
shall
sit
as
a
refiner
and
purifyer
of
silver
:
and
ke
shall
pa
[File:508]
rify
the
gons
of
Levi
,
and
purge
them
as
goid
and
silver
,
tha
they
may
offer
unto
the
Lord
an
offering
in
rightcousness
.
Then
shall
the
offering
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
be
pleasant
unto
the
Lord
,
as
in
the
days
of
old
,
and
as
in
former
year
,
And
I
will
come
near
to
you
to
judgement
:
and
I
will
bey
swift
witness
against
the
sorcerers
,
and
against
the
adulterers
,
and
against
false
swearers
,
and
against
those
that
oppress
tly
hireling
in
his

,
the
widow

and
the
fatherless
,
and
th
turn

and
offerings
,
Ye
are
cursed
with
a
curse
:
for
ye
have
robbed
me
,
evett

.
Bring
ye
all
the
tithes
into
the
storehouse
,
tha
there
may
be
meat
in
my
house
,
and
prove
me
now
herewith
Saith
the
Lord
of

,
if
I
will
not
opev
you

,
and
pour
you
out
a
blessing
,
that
there
shall
not

it
.
And
I
will
rebuke

for
your
sakes
,
and
he
Shall
not
destroy
the
fruits
of
yor
ground
;
neither
shall
your
vine
cast
her
fruit
before

tim
in

field
,
saith
the
Lord
of

,
And
all
nations
shall
cil
you
blessed
:
for
ye
shall
be
adelightsome
land
,
saith
the
Lat
of

.
Your
words
have
been
stout
against
me
,
saith
the
Lord~
Yet
ye
say
,
What
have
we
spoken
against
thee
?
Ye
have
sail
,
It
is
vain
to
serve
God
:
and
what
doth
it
prefit
that
we
bat
kept
his
ordinance
,
and
that
we
have
walked
mournfully
befurt
the
Lord
of
hosts
?
'
And
now
we
call
the
proud
happy
;
y&%
they
that
work
wickedness
are
set
up
;
yea
,
them
that
temp
God
are
even
delivered
,
Then
they
that
feared
the
Lord
spake
often
one
to
another
:
and
the
Lord
hearkened
,
and
heard
:
antl
a
book
of
remett
brance
was
written
before
him
for
them
that
feared
the
Lot
and
that
thought
upon
his
name
.
And
they
shall
be
mm
saith
the
Lord
of
hosts
,
in
-
that
day
when
I
make
up
my
Je
els
;
and
I
will
spare
them
,
as
a
man
spareth
his
own
son
serveth
him
.
Then
shall
ye
return
and
discern
between
#
righteous
and
the
wicked
,
between
him
that
serveth
God
[File:509]
him
that
serveth
him
not
.
For
behold
,
the
day
cometh
,
that
shall
burn
as
an
oven
;
and
all
the
proud
,
yea
,
and
all
that
do
wickedly
,
shall
be
stubble
:
and
the
day
that
cometh
shall
burn
them
up
,
saith
the
Lord
of
hosts
,
that
it
shall
leave
them
neither
root
nor
branch
.
But
unto
you
that
fear
my
name
,
shall
the
Son
of
righteousness
arise
with
healings
in
bis
wings
;
and
ye
shall
go
forth
,
and
grow
up
as
calves
in
the
stall
.
And
ye
shall
tread
down
the
wicked
;
for
they
shall
be
ashes
under
the
soles
of
your
feet
inthe
day
that
F
shall
do
this
,
saith
the
Lord
of
hosts
.
Remember
ye
the
law
of
Moses
my
servant
,
which
I
commanded
unto
him
in
Horeb
for
all
Israel
,
with
the
statutes
and
judgements
.
Behold
,
I
will
send
you
Elijah
the
prophet
before
the
coming
of
the
great
and
dreadful
day
of
the
Lord
:
and
he
shall
turn
the
heart
of
the
fathers
to
the
children
,
and
the
heart
of
the
children
to
their
fathers
,
lest
I
come
and
smite
the
earth
with
a
curse
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
told
these
things
,
he
expounded
them
unto
the
multitude
:
and
he
did
expound
all
things
unto
them
,
both
great
and
small
.
And
he
-
stith
,
These
Scriptures
which
ye
had
not
with
you
,
the
Father
commanded
that
I
should
give
unto
you
:
for
it
was
wisdom
in
him
that
they
should
he
given
unto
future
generations
.
And
he
did
expound
all
things
,
even
from
the
beginning
until
the
time
that
he
should
come
in
his
glory
;
yea
,
even
all
things
which
should
come
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
,
even
until
the
elements
should
melt
with
fervent
heat
,
and
the
earth
should
be
wrapt
together
as
a
scroll
,
and
the
heavens
and
the
earth
should
pass
away
;
and
even
unto
the
great
and
last
day
,
when
all
people
,
and
all
kindreds
,
and
all
nations
and
tongues
shall
stand
before
God
,
to
be
judged
of
their
works
,
whether
they
be
good
or
whether
they
he
evil
:
if
they
be
good
,
to
the
resurrection
of
everlasting
life
;
and
if
they
be
evil
,
to
the
resurrection
of
damnation
,
being
on
a
parallel
,
the
one
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
other
on
the
other
hand
,
according
to
the
mercy
,
and
the
justice
,
and
the
holiness
which
is
in
Christ
,
which
was
before
the
world
began

CHAPTER
XII
.
Ann
now
there
cannot
be
written
in
this
book
,
even
a
bun
.
dredth
part
of
the
things
which
Jesns
did
truly
teach
unto
the
people
;
but
behold
the
:
plates
of
Nephi
do
contain
the
more
.
part
of
the
things
which
he
taught
the
people
;
and
these
things
have
I
written
,
which
are
a
lesser
part
of
the
things
which
he
taught
the
people
;
and
I
have
wrote
them
to
the
jn
tent
that
they
may
be
brought
again
unto
this
people
,
from
the
Gentiles
,
according
to
the
words
which
Jesus
hath
spoken
.—
And
when
they
shall
have
received
this
,
which
is
expedient
that
they
should
have
first
,
to
try
their
faith
:
And
if
it
shall
so
be
that
,
they
shall
believe
these
things
,
then
shall
the
greater
things
be
made
manifest
unto
them
.
And
if
it
so
be
that
they
will
not
believe
these
things
,
then
shall
the
greater
things
be
withheld
from
them
,
unto
their
condemnation
.
Behold
were
about
to
wrile
them
all
which
were
engraven
upon
the'
plates
of
Nephi
,
but
the
Lord
forbid
it
,
saying
,
1
will
try
the
faith
of
my
people
;
therefore
I
,
Mormon
,
do
write
the
thing
:
which
have
been
commanded
we
of
the
Lord
.
And
now]
,
Mormon
,
make
an
end
of
my
sayings
,
and
proceed
to
write
the
things
which
.
have
been
commanded
me
;
therefore
f
would
that
ye
should
behold
that
the
Lord
truly
did
teach
the
people
,
for
the
space
of
three
days
;
and
after
that
,
he
did
shew
himself
unto
them
oft
,
and
did
break
bread
oft
,
and
bless
it
,
and
give
it
unto
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
teach
and
minister
unto
the
children
.
of
the
multitude
of
whom
hath
been
spoken
,
and
he
did
loose
their
tongues
,
and
they
did
speak
unto
their
fathers
great
and
marvellous
things
,
even
greater
than
he
had
reveal
ed
unto
the
people
,
and
loosed
their
tongues
that
they
could
utter
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
he
had
ascended
into
Heayen
the
second
time
that
he
shewed
himself
unto
them
,
and
gone
unto
the
Father
,
after
having
healed
all
their
sick
,
and
their
lame
,
and
opened
the
eyes
of
their
blind
,
and
une
stopped
the
ears
of
the
deaf
,
and
even
had
done
all
manner
of
cures
among
them
,
and
raised
a
man
from
the
dead
,
and
had
shewn
forth
his
power
unto
them
,
and
had
ascended
unto
the
Father
,
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
,
that
the
mullitude
gathered
themselves
together
,
and
they
both
saw
and
heard
these
children
;
yea
,
even
babes
did
open
their
mouths
,
and
utter
marvellous
things
;
and
the
things
which
they
did
utter
were
forbidden
,
that
there
should
not
any
man
wml
[File:511]
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
disciples
whom
Jesus
had
chosen
,
began
from
that
time
forth
to
baptize
and
to
teach
as
many
as
did
come
unto
them
;
and
as
many
as
were
baptizodin
the
name
of
Jesus
,
were
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost
.
And
many
of
them
saw
and
heard
unspeukable
things
,
which
are
not
lawful
to
be
written
;
and
they
taught
,
and
did
minister
one
to
another
;
and
they
had
all
things
common
among
them
,
ery
man
dealing
justly
,
oue
witl
another
.
And
it
came
to
ass
that
they
did
do
all
things
,
even
as
Jesus
had
commandedthem
.
And
they
which
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
Jesus
,
were
called
the
church
of
Christ
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
the
disciples
of
Jesus
were
jurseying
,
and
were
preaching
the
things
which
they
had
both
heard
and
seen
,
and
were
baptizing
in
the
name
of
Jesus
,
jit
came
to
pass
that
the
disciples
were
gaihered
together
,
and
were
united
in
mighty
prayer
and
fasting
.
And
Jesus
ayain
shewed
himself
unto
them
:
for
they
were
praying
unto
the
Father
,
in
bis
name
;
and
Jesus
came
and
stood
in
the
midst
them
,
and
saith
unto
them
,
What
will
ye
that
I
shall
give
unto
you
?
And
they
saith
unto
him
,
Lord
,
we
will
that
thow
wouldst
tel]
us
the
name
wheveby
we
shall
call
this
church
;
br
there
are
disputations
among
the
people
concerning
this
matter
,
And
the
Lord
said
unto
them
,
Verily
,
verily
Isay
unto
jou
,
why
is
it
that
the
people
should
murmur
and
dispute
because
of
this
thing
?
have
they
not
read
the
scriptures
,
which
sith
ye
must
take
upon
you
the
name
of
Chirist
,
which
is
myname
?
for
by
this
nase
shall
ye
be
called
at
the
last
day
;
and
whoso
taketh
upon
him
my
name
,
and
-
endureth
to
the
tnd
,
the
same
shall
be
saved
at
the
last
day
;
therefore
,
what
-
'
soever
ye
shall
do
,
ye
shall
.
do
it
in
my
name
;
therefore
ye
shallcall
the
church
in
my
name
;
and
ye
shall
call
upon
the
Father
in
my
name
,
that
he
will
bless
the
church
for
my
sake
;
ad
how
be
it
my
church
,
save
it
be
called
in
my

?
for
ifachurch

in
Moses'
name
,
then
it
be
Moses'
church
@
fit

then

then

Verily
I
vay

you
,
that
ye
are
built
upon
my
Gospel
;
therefore
ye
shalt
call
whatsoever
things

therefore
if

if

the

andifit
so
be

then

ly
Isay
unto
you
,
they
have
joy
in
their
works
for
a
Seasot
,
and
by
and
by
the
end
cometh
,
and
they
are
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
,
from
whence
there
is
no

;
for
their
works
do
follow
them
:
for
it
is
because
of
their
works
that
they
are
hewn
down
;
therefore
remember
the
things
that
have
told
you
.
Behold
}
have
given
unto
you
my
Gospel
,
and
this
is
the
Gospel
which
have
given
unto
you
:
That
I
came
into
the
world
to
do
the
will
of
my
Father
,
because
may
Father
sent
me
;
and
my
I'ather
sent
me
thatI
might
be
lifted
upupm
the
cross
;
and
after
that
I
had
been
lifted
up
upon
the
cross
,
might
draw
all
men
unto
me
;
that
as
have
been
lifted
up
by
men
,
even
so
should
men
be
lifted
up
by
the
Father
,
to
stand
before
me
,
to
be
judged
of
their
works
,
whether
they
be
goo
!
or
whether
they
be
evil
;
and
for
this
cause
have
I
been
lified
up
;
therefore
,
according
to
the
power
of
the
Father
,
I
wil
draw
all
men
unto
me
,
that
they
may
be
judged
according
to
their
works
.
And
it
skall
come
to
pass
,
that
whoso
repenteth
and
is
baptized
in
my
name
,
shall
be
filled
;
and
if
he
enti
.
reth
to
the
end
,
behold
,
him
will
1
hold
guiltless
before
ny
Father
,
at
that
day
when
I
shall
stand
to
judge
the
world
.
And
he
that
endureth
not
unto
the
end
,
the
same
is
he
that
is
ako
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
,
from
whence
they
can
0
more
return
,
because
of
the
justice
of
the
Father
;
and
thisis
the
word
which
he
hath
given
unto
the
children
of
men
.
And
for
this
cause
he
fulfilleth
the
words
which
he
hath
given
,
and
he
lieth
not
,
but
fulfilleth
all
his
words
;
and
no
unclean
thitg
can
enter
into
his
kingdom
;
therefore
nothing
entereth
into
his
rest
,
save
it
be
those
who
have
washed
their
garments
it
my
blood
,
because
of
their
faith
,
and
the
repentance
of
all
ther
sins
,
and
their
faithfulness
unto
the
end
.
Now
this
is
thecommandment
:
Repent
,
all
ye
ends
of
the
earth
,
and
come
uml
me
and
be
baptized
in
my
name
,
that
ye
may
be
sanctified
br
the
reception
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
that
ye
may
stand
spotles
before
me
at
the
last
day
.
Verily
,
verily
I
say
unto
you
,
this
is
my
Gospel
;
and
ye
know
the
things
that
ye
must
do
in
mf
church
;
for
the
works
which
ye
have
seen
me
do
,
that
shal
ye
also
do
;
for
that
which
ye
have
scen
medo
,
even
that
stall
ye
do
;
therefore
if
ye
do
these
things
,
blessed

because
of
you
,
and
also
this
generation
;
yea
,
and
even
the
Father
rejoiceth
,
and
also
all
the
holy
angels
,
because
of
you
and
this
generation
:
for
none
of
them
are
lost
.
Behold
,
1
would
that
ye
should
understand
;
for
1
mean
them
which
are
now
alive
,
of
this
generation
;
and
none
of
them
are
lost
;
and
in
them
1
have
fulness
of
joy
.—
But
behold
,
it
sorroweth
me
because
of
the
fourth
generation
from
this
generation
,
for
they
are
led
away
captive
by
him
,
even
as
was
the
son
of
perdition
;
for
they
will
scll_me
for
silver
,
and
for
gold
,
and
for
that
which
moth
doth
corrupt
,
and
which
thieves
can
break
through
and
steal
.
And
in
that
day
gi
visit
them
,
even
in
turning
their
works
upon
their
own
eads
,
_
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
ended
these
sayings
,
he
saith
unto
his
disciples
,
Enter
ye
in
at
the
straight
gate
:
for
straight
is
the
gate
,
and
narrow
is
the
way
that
leads
to
life
,
and
few
there
be
that
find
it
:
But
wide
is
the
gate
,
and
broad
the
way
which
leads
to
death
,
and
many
there
be
that
traveleth
therein
,
until
the
night
cometh
,
wherein
no
man
can
work
,
And
it
came
to
pass
when
Jesus
had
said
these
words
,
he
spake
unio
his
disciples
,
one
by
one
,
saying
unto
them
,
What
isit
that
ye
desire
of
me
,
after
that
I
am
gone
to
the
Father
?
Aad
they
all
spake
,
save
it
were
three
,
saying
,
We
desire
that
[File:514]
after
we
have
lived
unto
the
age
of
man
,
that
our
minisy
wherein
thou
hast
called
us
,
may
have
an
end
,
that
wen
speedily
come
unto
thee
,
in
thy
kingdom
,
And
he
saith
them
,
Blessed
are
ye
,
because
ye
desired
this
thing
of
me
therefore
after
that
ye
are
seventy
and
two
years
old
,
ye
shall
come
unto
me
in
my
kingdom
,
and
with
me
ye
shall
find
reg
,
And
when
he
had
spake
unto
them
,
he
turned
himself
untp
the
three
,
and
said
unto
them
,
What
will
ye
that
I
should
d
unto
you
,
when
I
am
gone
unto
the
Father
?
And
they
sor
rowed
in
their
hearts
,
for
they
durst
not
speak
unto
him
the
thing
which
they
desired
,
And
he
saith
unto
them
,
Behold
,
I
know
your
thoughts
,
and
ye
have
desired
the
thing
which
John
,
my
beloved
,
which
was
with
me
in
my
ministry
,
befor
that
I
was
lifted
up
by
the
Jews
,
desired
of
me
;
therefor
more
blessed
are
ye
,
for
ye
shull
never
taste
of
death
,
but
ye
shall
Jive
to
behold
all
the
doings
of
the
Father
,
unto
the
eli
dren
of
men
,
even
until
all
things
shall
be
fulfilled
,
accondig
to
the
will
of
the
Father
,
when
I
shall
come
in
my
glory
,
wilt
the
powers
of
heaven
;
and
ye
shall
never
endure
the
paitt
of
death
;
but
when
[shall
come
in
my
glory
,
ye
shall
be
char
ged
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eyc
,
from
mortality
to
immortality
;
and
then
shall
ye
be
blessed
in
the
kingdom
of
my
Father
—
And
again
,
ye
shall
not
have
pain
while
ye
shall
dwell
in
the
flesh
,
neither
sorrow
,
save
it
be
for
the
sins
of
the
world
;
and
all
this
will
I
do
because
of
the
ting
which
ye
have
desired
of
me
:
for
ye
have
desired
that
ye
might
bring
the
souls
men
unto
me
,
while
the
world
shall
stand
;
and
for
this
caus
ye
shall
have
fulness
of
:
joy
;
and
ye
shall
sit
down
in
the
kingdom
of
my
Father
;
yea
,
your
joy
shall
be
full
,
even
the
Father
hath
given
me
fulness
of
joy
;
and
ye
shall
be
evat
as
fam
;
and
I
am
even
as
the
Father
;
and
the
Father
and
Tare
one
;
and
the
.
Holy
Ghost
beareth
record
of
the
Father
and
me
;
and
the
Pather
giveth
the
Holy
Ghost
unto
the
ebil
dren
of
men
,
because
of
me
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
spake
these
worls
,
he
touched
every
one
of
them
with
his
finger
,
save
it
were
tle
three
which
were
to
farry
,
and
then
he
departed
,
And
be
hold
,
the
heavens
were
opened
,
and
they
were
caught
up
inld
heaven
,
and
saw
and
heard
unspeakable
things
.
And
it
wis
forbidden
them
that
they
should
utter
;
neither
was
it
give
unto
then
power
that
they
could
utter
the
things
which
they
.
saw
and
heard
;
and
whether
they
were
in
the
body
or
oul”
the
body
,
they
could
not
tell
:
for
it
did
seem
unto
them
like
[File:515]
a
transfiguration
of
them
,
that
they
were
changed
from
this
body
of
flesh
,
into
an
immortal
state
,
that
they
could
behold
the
things
.
of
God
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
again
junister
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
;
uevertheless
they
did
not
minister
of
the
things
which
they
had
heard
and
seen
,
because
of
the
commandment
which
was
given
them
in
heaven
.
And
now
whether
they
were
mortal
or
immortal
,
from
the
day
of
their
transfiguration
,
I
know
not
;
but
this
much
know
:
According
1o
the
record
which
hath
been
given
,
they
did
go
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
did
minister
unto
all
the
people
,
uniting
as
many
to
the
church
as
would
believe
in
their
preaching
;
baptizing
them
;
and
as
many
as
were
baptied
,
did
receive
the
Holy
Ghost
;
and
they
were
cast
into
prison
by
them
who
did
not
belong
to
the
church
.
And
the
prisons
could
not
hold
them
,
for
they
were
rent
in
twain
,
and
they
were
cast
down
jnio
the
earth
.
But
they
did
smite
the
earth
with
the
word
of
God
,
insomuch
that
by
his
power
they
were
delivered
out
of
the
depths
of
the
earth
;
and
therefore
they
could
not
dig
pits
sufficiently
to
hold
them
.
And
thrice
they
were
cast
into
a
furnace
,
and
received
no
harm
.
And
twice
were
they
cast
into
a
den
of
wild
beasts
;
and
behold
they
did
play
with
the
beasts
,
as
a
child
witha
suckling
lamb
,
and
received
no
harm
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
they
did
go
forth
amoug
all
the
people
of
Nephi
,
and
did
preach
the
gospel
of
Christ
unto
all
people
upon
the
face
of
the
land
:
And
they
were
converted
unto
the
Lord
,
and
were
united
unto
the
church
of
Christ
:
And
thus
the
people
of
that
generation
Were
blessed
,
according
to
the
word
of
Jesus
.
And
now
I
,
Mormon
,
male
an
end
of
speaking
concerning
these
things
,
fora
time
.
Behold
,
1
were
about
to
write
the
names
of
those
who
were
never
to
taste
of
death
;
but
the
Lord
forbade
,
therefore
I
write
them
not
,
for
they
are
hid
from
the
world
.
But
behold
I
have
seen
them
,
and
they
have
ministered
unto
me
;
and
behold
they
will
he
wnong
the
Gentiles
,
and
the
Gentiles
2
knoweth
them
not
.
They
will
also
be
among
the
Jews
,
and
the
Jews
shall
know
thei
not
.
Aad
it
shali
come
io
pass
,
when
the
Lord
seeth
fit
in
his
si
that
they
shall
minister
unto
all
the
scattered
tribes
Ssreel
,
und
unto
all
nations
,
kindred
,
tongues
and
people
,
and
sill
bring
out
of
them
unto
Jesus
many
souls
,
that
their
deremay
be
fullilled
,
and
also
because
of
the
convincing
power
of
God
which
isin
them
;
and
they
are
as
the
angels
of
God
ud
if
they
shall
pray
unto
the
Father
in
the
name
of
Jesus
[File:516]
hey
can
shew
themselves
unto
whatsoever
man
it
seemeth
them
good
;
therefore
great
and
marvellous
works
shall
be
wrought
by
them
,
before
the
great
and
coming
day
,
when
all
people
must
surely
stand
before
the
judgement
seat
of
Christ
,
yea
,
even
among
the
Gentiles
shall
there
be
a
great
and
map
.
vellous
work
wrought
by
them
,
before
that
judgement
day
—
And
if
ye
had
all
the
seriptures
which
gives
an
account
of]
the
marvellous
works
of
Christ
,
ye
would
,
according
to
the
words
of
Christ
,
know
that
these
things
must
surcly
come
—
And
wo
be
unto
him
that
will
not
hearken
unto
the
words
of
Jesus
,
and
also
to
them
which
he
hath
chosen
and
sentamo
them
:
for
whoso
receiveth
not
the
words
of
Jesus
,
and
the
words
of
them
which
he
hath
sent
,
receiveth
not
him
;
and
therefore
he
will
not
receive
them
at
the
last
day
;
and
it
wonld
be
better
for
them
if
they
had
not
been
born
.
For
do
ye
suppose
that
ye
can
get
rid
of
the
justice
of
an_
offended
God
,
who
hath
been
trampled
under
feet
of
men
,
that
thereby
salvation
might
come
?
And
now
behold
,
as
1
spake
concer
ning
them
whom
the
Lord
had
chosen
,
yea
,
even
three
which
were
caught
up
into
the
Heavens
,
that
I
knew
ool
whether
they
were
cleansed
from
mortality
to
immortality
:—
Bui
behold
,
since
I
wrote
,
I
have
inquired
of
the
Lord
,
and
hath
made
it
manifest
unto
me
,
that
there
must
needs
ber
change
wrought
upon
their
bodies
,
or
else
it
needs
be
thal
ihcy
must
taste
of
death
;
therefore
that
they
might
not
tasted
!
death
,
there
was
a
change
wrought
upon
their
bodies
,
that
they
might
not
suffer
pam
nor
sorrow
,
save
it
were
for
tht
sins
of
the
world
.
Now
this
change
was
not
equal
to
tht
which
should
take
place
at
the
last
day
,
but
there
was
a
chamgt
wrought
upon
them
,
insomuch
that
satan
could
have
no
pow
over
them
,
tbat
he
conld
not
tempt
them
,
and
they
were
sant
tified
in
the
flesh
,
that
they
were
holy
,
and
that
the
powers
d
the
earth
could
not
hold
them
;
and
in
this
state
they
were
remain
until
the
judgement
day
of
Christ
;
and
at
that
day
they
were
to
receive
a
greater
change
,
and
to
be
received
into
the
kingdom
of
the
Father
,
togo
no
more
out
,
but
to
dwell
with
God
eternally
in
the
Heavens
.
And
now
behold
,
J
sf
unto
you
,
that
when
the
Lord
shall
see
fit
,
in
his
wisdom
,
tit
these
sayings
shall
come
unto
the
Gentiles
,
according
to
bi
word
,
then
ye
may
know
that
the
covenant
which
the
Father
hath
made
with
the
children
of
Israel
,
concerning
their
resto™
tion
to
the
lands
of
their
inheritance
,
is
already
beginning
to
be
fulfilled
;
and
ye
may
know
that
the
words
of
the
Lord
,
whith
[File:517]
jaye
been
spoken
by
the
holy
prophets
,
shall
all
be
fulfilled
;
and
ye
need
not
say
that
the
Lord
delays
his
coming
unto
the
children
of
Israel
;
and
ye
need
not
imagine
in
your
hearts
,
that
the
words
which
have
becn
spoken
are
vain
,
for
behold
,
the
Lord
will
remember
his
covenant
which
he
hath
made
unto
his
people
of
the
house
of
Israel
.
And
when
ye
shall
see
these
sayings
coming
forth
among
you
,
then
ye
need
not
any
longer
spun
at
the
doings
of
the
Lord
,
for
the
sword
of
his

justice
is
in
his
right
hand
,
and
behold
at
that
day
,
if
ye
shall
spurn
at
his
doings
,
he
will
cause
it
that
it
shall
soon
overtake
you
.
Wo
unto
him
that
spurneth
at

doings
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
wo
unto
him
that
shall
deny
the
Christ
and
his
works
;
yea
,
wo
unto
him
that
shall
deny
the
revelations
of
the
Lord
,
and
that
shall
say
,
the
Lord
no
longer
worketh
by

or
by

or
by

or
by

or
bythe
power

yea
,
and
wo
unto
him
that

say
at
that
day
,
that
there
can
be
no
miracle
wrought
by
Jesus
Christ
,
for
to
get
gain
;
for
he
that
doeth
this
,
shall
become
like
unto
the
son
of
perdition
,
for
whom
there
was
no
merey
,
according
io
the
word
of
Christ
.
Yea
,
and
ye
need
sotany
longer
hiss

,
nor
make
game
of

Jews

wor
of

of
the
remnant

for
behold
the
Lord
remembereth
his
covenant
unto
them
,
and
he
willdo
unto
them
according
to
that
which
he
hath
sworn
;
therefore
ye
need
not
suppose
that
ye
can
turn
the
right
hand
of
the
Lord
unto
the
left
,
that

THE
BOOK
OF
NEPIU
,
WHICH
IS
THE
SON
OF
NEPHI
,
ONE
OF
THE
DISCIPLES
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
.
CHAPTER
I
.
An
account
of
the
people
of
Nephi
,
according
to
his
Recori
.
Anp
it
came
to
pass
that
the
thirty
and
fourth
year
passed
away
,
and
also
the
thirty
and
fifth
,
and
behold
the
disciples
of
Jesus
had
formed
a
church
of
Christ
in
all
the
lands
round
about
.
And
as
many
as
did
come
unto
them
,
and
did
try
repent
of
their
sins
,
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
Jesus
;
aid
they
did
also
receive
the
Iloly
Ghost
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirty
and
sixth
year
,
the
people
were
all
converted
unto
the
Lord
,
upon
all
the
face
of
theland
,
both
Nephites
and
Lamanites
,
and
there
was
no
contentiois
and
disputations
among
them
,
and
every
man
did
deal
jusly
one
with
another
;
and
they
had
all
things
common
amg
them
,
therefore
there
were
not
rich

And
it
came

and
there
still
continued
to

there
were

works
wrought

and

and

and

and
the
fifty
and

;
yea
,
and
even
wall
fifly
and
nine
years
had
passed
away
;
and
the
Lord
did
[File:519]
prosper
them
exceedingly
,
in
the
land
;
yea
,
insomuch
that
they
did
fill
cities
again
where
there
had
been

yea
,
oven
that
great
city
Zarahemla
.
did
they
cause
to
be
built
again
,
But
there
were
many
cities
which
had
been
sunk
,
and
waters
came
up
in
the
stead
thereof
;
therefore
these
cities
could
not
be
renewed
.
And
now
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
tlie
people
of
Nephi
did
wex
strong
,
and
did
multiply
exceeding
,
fast
,
and
became
an
exceeding
fair
and
delightsome
people
..
And
they
were
married
,
and
given
in
marriage
,
and
were
blessed
according
to
the
multitude
of
the
fremises
which
the
Lord
had
made
unto
them
,
And
they
did
not
walk
any
more
after
the
performances
and
ordinances
of
the
law
of
Moses
,
but
they
did
walk
after
the
commandments
which
they
had
received
from
their
Lord
and
their
God
,
continuing
in
fasting
and
prayer
,
and
in
meeting
together
oft
,
both
to
pray
and
to
hear
the
word
of
the
ford
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
no
contention
among
all
the
people
,
in
all
the
land
,
but
there
were
mighty
nitacles
wrought
among
the
disciples
of
Jesus
.
And
it
came
to
pass
thatthe
seventy
and
first
year
passed
away
,
aud
also
the
seventy
and
second
year
;
yea
,
and
in
fine
fill
the
seventy
.
and
ninth
year
had
passed
away
;
yea
,
even
an
hundred
years
had
passed
away
,
and
the
disciples
of
Jesus
,
whom
he
had
chosen
,
had
all
gone
to
the
paradise
of
God
,
save
itwere
the
three
which
should
tarry
:
And
there
were
other
disciples
ordained
in
their
stead
;
and
also
many
of
that
genetation
which
had
passed
away
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
no
contention
in
the
land
,
because
of
the
loye
of
God
whichdid
dwell
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
.
And
there
Were
no
envyings
,
nor
strifes
,
nor
tumulis
,
nor
whoredoms
,
nor
lyings
,
nor
murders
,
nor
ne
manner
.
of
lascivioushess
:
and
surely
there
could
not
bea
happier
people
among
all
the
people
which
had
been
created
by
the
hand
of
God
:
There
were
10
robbers
,
nor
no
murderers
,
neither
were
there
Lamanites
,
tor
no
manner
of
Ites
;
but
they
were
in
one
,
the
children
of
Christ
,
and
heirs
to
the
kingdom
of
God
:
And
!
how
blessed
Were
they
,
for
the
Lord
did
bless
them
in
all
their
doings
;
yea
,
even
they
were
blessed
and
prospered
,
until
an
hundred
and
fen
years
had
passed
away
:
And
the
first
generation
from
Christ
had
passed
away
,
and
there
was
no
contention
in
all
the
land
.
t
An@
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
,
he
that
kept
this
last
record
,
{and
he
,
kept
it
upon
the
plates
of
Nephi
)
died
,
and
his
son
.
[File:520]
Amos
kept
it
in
his
stead
;
and
he
kept
it
upon
the
plates
of
Nephi
also
;
and
he
kept
it
eighty
and
four
years
,
and
there
was
still
peace
in
the
land
,
save
it
were
a
small
part
of
the
people
,
which
had
revolted
from
the
church
,
and
took
upon
them
the
name
of
Lamanites
;
therefore
there
began
to
be
La
.
manites
again
in
the
land
.
And
it
eame
to
pass
that
Amos
died
also
,
(
and
it
was
an
hundred
and
ninety
and
four
years
from
the
coming
of
Christ
)
and
his
son
Amos
kept
the
record
in
his
stead
;
and
he
also
kept
it
upon
the
plates
of
Nephi
;
and
it
was
also
written
in
the
book
of
Nephi
,
which
is
this
book
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
two
hundred
years
had
passed
away
:
And
the
seconi
generation
had
all
passed
away
save
it
were
a
few
.
And
now
i
,
Mormon
,
would
that
ye
should
know
that
the
people
had
multiplied
,
insomuch
that
they
were
spread
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
apd
that
they
had
become
exceeding
rich
,
because
of
their
prosperity
in
Christ
,
And'now
in
this
two
hundred
and
first
year
,
there
began
to
be
among
them
those
whieh
were
lifted
up
in
pride
,
such
as
the
wearing
of
costly
apparel
,
and
all
manner
of
fine
pearls
,
and
of
the
fine
things
of
the
world
.
And
from
that
time
forth
they
did
have
their
goods
and
their
substance
no
more
common
among
them
,
and
they
began
to
be
divided
into
classes
,
and
they
began
to
build
up
churches
unto
themselves
,
to
get
gain
,
and
began
to
deny
the
true
church
of
Christ
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
two
hundred
and
ten
yeas
had
passed
away
there
were
many
churches
in
the
land
;
yea
there
were
churches
which
professed
to
know
the
Christ
,
and
yet
they
did
deny
the
more
parts
of
his
gospel
,
insomuch
thai
they
did
receive
all
manner
of
wickedness
,
and
did
administer
that
which
was
sacred
unto
him
to
whom
it
had
been
forbid
:
den
,
because
of
unworthiness
.
And
this
church
did
multiply
execedingly
,
because
of
iniquity
,
and
because
of
the
power
0
satan
which
did
get
hold
upon
their
hearts
.
And
again
,
there
was
another
church
,
which
denied
the
Christ
;
and
they
did
persecute
the
true
church
of
Christ
,
because
of
their
humility
,
and
their
beliefin
Christ
;
and
they
did
despise
them
,
beeaus
of
the
many
miracles
which
were
wrought
among
them
3
therefore
they
did
exercise
power
and
authority
over
the
disciples
of
Jesus
which
did
tarry
with
them
,
and
they
did
cast
them
into
prison
;
but
by
the
power
of
the
word
of
God
,
which
#2
jn
them
,
the
prisons
were
rent
in
twain
,
and
they
went
for
!
doing
mighty
miracles
among
them
.
Neveriheless
,
and
not
[File:521]
withstanding
all
these
miracles
the
people
did
harden
their
hearts
,
and
did
seek
to
kill
them
,
even
as
the
Jews
at
Jerusalem
sought
to
kill
Jesus
,
according
to
his
word
,
and
they
did
casi
them
imto
furnaces
of
fire
,
and
they
came
forth
receiving
noharm
;
and
they
also
cast
them
into
dens
of
wild
beasts
,
and
they
did
play
with
the
wild
beasts
even
as
a
child
with
a
lamb
;
and
they
did
come
forth
from
among
them
,
receiving
noharm
.
Nevertheless
,
the
people
did
harden
their
hearts
,
for
they
were
led
by
many
priests
and
false
prophets
to
build
up
many
~churches
,
and
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
.
And
they
did
smite
upon
the
people
of
Jesus
;
but
the
people
of
Jesus
did
not
smite
ugain
.
And
thus
they
did
dwindle
in
unbelief
and
wickedness
,
from
year
to
year
,
even
until
two
hundred
and
thirty
years
had
passed
away
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
in
this
year
,
yea
,
in
the
two
hundred
and
thirty
and”
first
year
,
there
were
a
great
division
among
the
people
.
And
it
came
{o
pass
that
in
this
year
there
arose
a
people
which
was
called
the
Nephites
,
and
they
were
true
believers
in
Christ
;
and
among
them
there
were
they
which
was
called
by
the
Lamanites
,
Jacobites
,
and
Josephites
,
and
Zoranites
;
therefore
the
true
believers
in
Christ
,
and
the
true
worshippers
of
Christ
,
(
among
whom
were
the
three
disciples
of
Jesus
which
should
iarry
,)
were
called
Nephites
,
and
Jacobites
,
and
Josephites
,
and
Zoramites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
which
rejectel
the
gospel
,
were
called
Lamanites
,
and
Lemuelites
,
and
Ishmaelites
;
and
they
did
not
dwindle
in
unbelief
,
but
they
did
wilfwly
rebel
against
the
gospel
of
Christ
;
and
they
did
teach
their
children
that
they
should
not
believe
,
even
as
their
fathers
,
from
the
beginning
,
did
dwindle
.
And
it
was
because
of
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
their
fathers
,
even
as
it
was
inthe
beginning
,
And
they
were
taught
te
hate
the
children
of
God
,
even
as
the
Lamanites
were
taught
to
hate
the
children
of
Nephi
,
from
the
beginning
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
two
hundred
and
forty
and
four
years
had
passed
away
,
and
thus
were
the
affairs
of
the
people
.
And
the
more
wicked
part
of
the
people
did
wax
strong
,
and
became
exceeding
more
numerous
than
were
the
people
of
God
.
And
they
did
still
continue
to
build
up
churches
unto
themselves
,
and
adorn
them
with
all
manner
of
precious
things
.
And
thus
did
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
pass
.
away
,
and
also
two
hundred
and
sixty
years
.
And
it
came
1o
pass
that
the
wicked
part
of
the
people
began
again
to
build
up
the
secret
oaths
and
combinations
of
Gaddianton
.
And
also
the
;
+
[File:522]
people
which
were
called
the
people
of
Nephi
,
began
to
be
Pew
in
their
hearts
,
because
of
their
exceeding
riches
,
and
ecome
vain
,
like
unto
their
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
.
And
from
this
time
,
the
disciples
began
to
sorrow
for
the
sins
of
the
world
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
three
hundred
years
had
passed
away
,
both
the
people
of
Nephi
and
the
Lamanites
had
be
come
exceeding
wicked
,
one
like
unto
another
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
robbers
of
Gaddianton
did
spread
over
all
the
face
ofthe
land
;
and
there
were
none
that
were
righteous
,
Saye
it
were
the
disciples
of
Jesus
,
And
gold
and
silver
did
they
lay
up
in
store
in
abundance
,
and
did
traffic
in
al
!
manner
of
traffic
,
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
three
hundred
and
five
yeu
had
passed
away
,
(
and
the
people
did
still
remain
in
wicked
ness
,)
Amos
died
,
and
his
brother
,
Ammaron
,
did
keep
the
record
,
in
his
stead
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
three
hundred
and
twenty
years
had
passed
away
,
Ammaron
,
being
constrained
by
the
Holy
Ghost
,
did
hide
up
the
records
which
were
sacred
;
yea
,
even
all
the
sacred
records
which
had
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
,
which
were
sacred
,
even
until
the
three
hundred
and
twentieth
year
from
the
coming
of
Christ
.
And
he
did
hide
them
up
unto
the
Lord
,
that
they
might
come
again
unto
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
Jacob
,
according
to
the
prophecies
and
the
promises
of
the
Lord
.
And
thus
is
the
end
of
the
record
of
Ammaron

CHAPTER
.
-
Anp
now
I
,
Mormon
,
make
a
record
of
the
things
which
have
both
seen
and
heard
,
and
call
it
the
Book
of
Mormon
—
And
about
the
time
that
Ammaron
hid
up
the
records
unt
the
Lord
,
he
came
unto
me
,
(
1
being
about
ten
years
of
age
)
and
I
began
to
be
learned
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
the
learning
of
my
people
,)
and
Ammaron
saith
unto
me
,
}
per
ceive
that
thou
arta
sober
child
,
and
art
quick
to
observe
:
therefore
when
ye
are
about
twenty
and
four
years
old
,!
would
that
ye
should
remember
the
things
that
reba
served
concerning
this
people
;
and
when
ye
are
of
that
age
[File:523]
go
to
the
Jand
of
Antum
,
unto
a
hill
,
which
shall
be
called
Shim
;
and
there
have
I
deposited
unto
the
Lord
,
all
the
sacred
engravings
concerning
this
people
.
And
behold
,
ye
shal]
take
the
plates
of
Nephi
unto
yourself
,
and
the
remainder
shall
ye
leave
in
the
place
where
they
are
;
and
ye
shall
engrave
upon
the
plates
of
Nephi
,
all
the
things
that
ye
haye
observed
concerning
this
people
.
And
1
,
Mormon
,
being
a
descendant
of
Nephi
,
(
and
my
father's
name
was
Mormon
,)
1
remembered
the
things
which
Ammaron
commanded
me
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
being
cleven
years
old
,
was
carried
by
my
father
into
the
land
southward
,
even
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
:
the
whole
face
of
the
land
having
become
covered
with
buildings
,
and
the
people
were
as
numerous
almost
,
as
it
were
the
sand
of
the
sea
,
And
it
came
to
pass
in
this
year
,
there
began
to
be
a
war
between
the
Nephites
,
which
consisted
of
the
Nephites
,
and
the
Jacobites
,
and
the
Josephites
,
and
the
Zoramites
:
and
this
war
was
between
the
Nephites
,
and
the
Lamanites
,
and
the
Lemuelites
,
and
the
Ishiaelites
.
Now
the
Lamanites
,
and
the
Lemuelites
,
and
the
Ichmaelites
,
were
called
Lamanites
,
and
the
two
parties
.
were
Nephites
and
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
war
began
to
be
among
them
,
in
the
borders
of
Zarahemla
,
by
the
waters
of
Sidon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
had
gathered
together
a
great
number
of'men
,
even
to
exceed
the
number
of
thirty
thousand
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
haye
in
this
same
year
a
number
of
battles
,
in
the
which
the
Nephites
did
beat
the
Lamanites
,
and
did
slay
many
of
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
withdrew
their
design
,
and
there
was
peace
settled
in
the
land
,
and
peace
did
remain
for
the
space
of
about
four
years
,
that
there
were
no
blood
shed
.
But
wickedness
did
prevail
upon
the
face
of
the
whole
land
,
insomuch
that
the
Lord
did
take
away
his
beloved
distiples
,
and
the
work
of
miracles
and
of
healing
did
cease
,
_
because
of'
the
iniquity
of
the
people
.
And
there
were
no
gifis
from
the
Lord
,
and
the
Holy
Ghost
did
not
come
upon
any
,
because6f
their
wickedness
and
unbelief
.
And
I
,
being
fifteen
years
of
age
,
and
being
somewhat
of
a
sober
mind
,
therfore
I
was
visited
of
the
Lord
,
and
tasted
,
and
knew
of
the
goddness
of
Jesus
.
And
1
did
endeavor
to
preach
unto
this
people
,
but
my
mouth
was
shut
,
and
I
were
forbidden
that
Tshould
preach
unto
them
:
for
behold
they
had
wilfully
rebelled
against
their
God
,
and
the
beloved
disciples
were
taken
away
out
of
the
land
,
because
of
their
iniquity
.
But
I
did
[File:524]
remain
among
them
,
but
I
were
forbidden
that
1
shoud
preach
unto
them
,
because
of
the
bardness
of
their
hearts
;
end
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
,
the
land
was
-
cursed
for
their
sake
,
And
these
Gaddianton
robbers
,
which
were
among
the
Lamanites
,
did
infest
the
land
,
insomuch
tha
the
inhabitants
thereof
began
to
hide
up
their
treasures
in
thy
earth
;
and
they
became
slippery
,
because
the
Lord
had
cursed
the
land
,
that
they
could
not
hold
them
,
nor
retain
them
again
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
sorceries
,
and
witch
crafts
,
and
magics
:
and
the
power
of
the
evil
one
was
wrought
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
even
unto
the
fulfilling
ef
all
the
words
of
Abinadi
,
and
also
Samuel
the
Lamanite
—
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
that
same
year
,
there
began
to
be
a
war
again
between
the
Nephites
and
the
Lamanites
.
Ani
notwithstanding
I
being
young
,
was
large
in
stature
,
therefore
the
people
of
Nephi
appointed
me
that
I
should
be
their
leader
or
the
leader
of
theit
armics
,
Therefore
it
came
to
pass
tha
in
my
sixteenth
year
,
I
did
go
forth
at
the
head
of
an
army
of
the
Nephites
,
against
the
Lamanites
;
therefore
three
hundred
and
twenty
and
six
years
had
passed
away
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
twenty
and
seventh
year
,
the
Lamanites
did
come
upon
us
with
exceeding
great
power
,
insomuch
that
they
did
frighten
my
armies
;
therefore
they
would
not
fight
,
and
they
began
to
retreat
towards
the
norlh
countries
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
come
to
-
the
city
of
Angelah
,
and
we
did
take
possession
of
the
city
,
and
make
preparations
to
defend
ourselves
against
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
lo
pass
that
we
did
fortify
the
city
with
our
mights
;
but
notwithstanding
all
our
fortifications
,
the
Lamanites
did
come
upon
us
,
and
did
drive
us
out
of
the
city
.
And
they
did
also
drive
us
forth
out
of
the
land
of
David
.
And
we
marchel
forth
,
and
came
to
the
land
of
Joshua
,
which
was
in
the
bor
ders
west
,
by
the
seashore
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
gather
in
our
people
as
fast
as
it
were
possible
,
that
we
might
get
them
together
in
one
body
.
But
behold
,
the
land
was
filled
with
robbers
and
with
Lamanites
;
and
notwithstanding
the
great
destruction
which
hung
over
my
people
,
they
did
m0
repent
of
their
evil
doings
;
therefore
there
was
blood
ant
carnage
spread
throughout
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
both
on
the
part
of
the
Nephites
,
and
also
on
the
part
of
the
Lamanites
;
and
it
was
one
complete
revolution
throughout
all
the
face
0
the
land
.
And
now
the
Lamanites
had
a
king
,
and
his
name
was
Aaron
;
and
he
came
against
us
with
an
army
of
forty
and
[File:525]
four
thousand
.
And
behold
,
I
withstood
him
,
with
forty
and
two
thousand
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
1
beat
him
with
my
army
,
that
he
fled
before
me
.
And
behold
,
all
this
was
done
,
and
three
hundred
and
thirty
years
had
passed
away
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
began
to
repent
of
their
imiquity
,
and
began
to
cry
even
as
had
been
prophesied
by
Samuel
the
prophet
;
for
behold
no
man
could
keep
that
which
was
his
own
,
for
the
thieves
,
and
the
robbers
,
and
the
rumderers
,
and
the
magic
art
,
and
the
witchcraft
which
was
in
the
Jend
.
Thus
there
began
to
he
a
mourning
and
a
lamentation
in
all
the
land
,
because
of
these
things
;
and
more
especially
among
the
people
of
Nephi
,
And
it
came
io
pass
that
when
1
,
Mormon
,
saw
their
lamentation
,
and
their
mourning
,
and
their
sorrowing
before
the
Lord
,
my
heart
did
begin
to
rejoice
within
me
;
knowing
the
mercies
and
the
long
suffering
of
the
Lord
,
therefore
supposing
that
he
would
be
merciful
unto
them
,
that
they
would
again
become
a
righteous
people
.
But
behold
this
my
joy
was
vain
,
for
their
sorrowing
was
not
unto
repentance
,
because
of
the
goodness
of
God
,
but
it
was
rather
the
sorrowimg
of
the
damned
,
because
the
Lord
would
not
always
suffer
them
1o
take
happiness
in
sin
.
And
they
did
not
come
unto
Jesus
with
broken
hearts
and
contrite
spirits
,
but
they
did
curse
God
,
and
wish
to
dic
.
~Nevertheless
they
would
struggle
with
the
sword
for
their
lives
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
my
sorrow
did
return
unto
me
again
,
and
I
saw
that
the
day
of
grace
was
past
with
thom
,
both
temporally
and
spiritually
:
for
1
saw
thousands
of
them
hewn
dowh
in
open
rebellion
against
their
God
,
and
heaped
up
as
dung
upon
the
face
of
the
Jand
.
And
thus
three
hundred
and
forty
and
four
years
had
passed
away
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
forty
and
fifth
year
,
the
Nephites
did
begin
to
flee
before
the
Lamanites
,
and
they
were
pursued
until
they
came
even
to
the
land
of
Jashon
,
before
it
were
.
possible
to
stop
them
in
their
retreat
.
And
now
the
city
of
Jashon
was
near
the
land
where
Ammaton
had
deposited
the
records
unto
the
Lord
,
that
they
might
not
be
destroyed
.
And
behold
I
had
gone
according
to
the
word
of
Ammaron
,
and
taken
the
plates
of
Nephi
,
and
did
take
a
record
according
to
the
words
of
Ammaron
.
And
upon
the
plates
of
Nephi
I
did
make
a
full
account
of
all
the
Wickedness
and
abominations
;
but
upon
these
plates
1
did
forbear
to
make
a
full
account
of
their
wickedness
and
abomMations
:
for
behold
,
a
continual
scene
of
wickedness
and
[File:526]
abominations
has
been
before
mine
eyes
ever
since
I
have
beep
suilicient
to
behold
the
ways
of
man
,
And
wo
is
me
,
becaus
:
of
their
wickedness
:
for
my
heart
has
been
filled
with
sorroy
because
of
their
wickedness
,
all
my
days
;
nevertheless
,
know
that
I
shall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
year
the
people
of
Nephi
again
were
hunted
and
driven
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
were
driven
forth
until
we
had
come
northward
to
the
Ta
which
was
called
Shem
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
di
fortify
the
city
of
Shem
,
and
we
did
gather
in
our
peopie
as
much
as
it
were
possible
,
that
perhaps
we
might
save
then
from
destruction
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
three
hundred
and
forty
and
sixth
year
,
they
began
to
eome
upon
us
agai
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
J
did
speak
unto
my
people
,
and
did
urge
them
with
great
energy
,
that
they
would
stand
boldly
be
fore
the
Lamanites
,
and
fight
for
their
wives
,
and
their
chil
dren
,
and
their
houses
,
and
their
homes
.
And
my
words
did
arouse
them
somewhat
to
vigor
,
insomuch
that
they
did
nol
flee
from
before
the
Lamanites
,
but
did
stand
with
boldnes
against
them
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
contend
with
an
army
of
thirty
thousand
,
agaist
an
army
of
fifty
thousam
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
stand
before
them
with
such
firmness
,
that
they
did
flee
from
before
us
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
fled
,
we
did
pursue
them
with
our
armic
,
and
did
meet
them
again
,
and
did
beat
them
;
nevertheless
the
strength
of
the
Lordiwas
not
with
us
:
yea
,
we
were
leltio
ourselves
,
that
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
did
not
abide
im
15
;
therefore
we
had
become
weak
,
like
unto
our
brethren
.
Ant
my
heart
did
sorrow
because
of
this
the
great
calamity
of
mj
people
;
because
of
their
wickedness
and
their
abominations
But
behold
we
did
go
forth
against
the
Lamanites
,
and
tle
robbers
of
Gaddianton
,
until
we
had
again
taken
possessi0
?
of
the
lands
of
our
inheritance
.
And
the
three
hundred
ant
forty
and
ninth
year
had
passed
away
.
And
in
the
three
hur
dred
and
fiftieth
year
,
we
made
a
treaty
with
the
Lamaniles
and
the
robbers
of
Gaddianton
,
in
the
which
we
did
get
the
Jands
of
our
inheritance
divided
.
And
the
Lamanites
@
give
unto
us
the
land
northward
;
yea
,
even
to
the
narrow
passage
which
Jed
into
the
land
southward
.
And
we
did
giv'
unto
the
Lamanites
all
the
land
southwardAnd
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
not
come
to
hat
ile
again
until
ten
years
more
had
passed
away
.
And
behold
,
Thad
employed
my
people
,
the
Nephites
,
in
preparing
thee
[File:527]
jands
and
their
arms
against
the
time
of
battle
.
And
it
came
ty
pass
that
the
Lord
did
say
unto
me
,
Cry
unto
this
people
repent
ye
,
and
come
unto
me
and
be
ye
baptized
,
and
build
up
again
my
church
,
and
ye
shall
be
spared
.
And
1
did
ery
unto
this
people
,
but
it
was
in
vain
,
and
they
did
not
realise
that
it
was
the
Lord
that
had
spared
them
,
end
granted
unto
them
a
chance
for
repentance
.
And
behold
they
did
harden
their
hearts
against
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
this
tenth
year”
had
passed
away
,
making
,
in
the
whole
,
three
hundred
and
sixty
years
from
the
coming
of
Christ
,
the
ting
of
the
Laimanites
sent
an
epistle
unto
me
,
which
gave
ato
me
to
know
that
they
were
preparing
to
come
again
to
pattie
against
us
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
cause
my
people
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
at
the
land
Desolation
,
to
a
city
which
was
in
the
borders
,
by
the
narrow
pass
which
lead
into
the
land
southward
.
And
there
we
did
qlace
our
armies
,
that
we
might
stop
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
might
not
get
possession
of
any
of
our
lanas
;
therefore
we
did
fortify
against
them
with
all
our
forec
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
and
frst
year
,
the
Lamanites
did
come
down
to
the
city
of
Desolation
to
battle
,
against
us
.
And
it
came
te
pass
that
in
thet
year
,
we
did
beat
them
,
insomuch
that
they
did
return
to
their
own
lands
again
.
And
in
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
and
second
year
,
they
did
come
down
again
to
battle
.
And
we
did
beat
them
again
,
and
did
slay
a
great
number
of
them
,
and
their
dead
was
cast
into
the
sea
.
And
now
because
of
this
grat
thing
which
my
people
,
the
Nephites
,
had
done
,
they
began
t@yhoast
in
their
own
strength
,
and
began
to
swear
before
the
heavens
that
they
would
avenge
themselves
of
the
blood
of
their
brethren
which
had
been
slain
by
their
enemies
.
Ant
they
did
swear
by
the
heavens
,
and
also
by
the
throne
of
God
,
that
they
would
go
up
to
battle
against
their
enemies
,
and
would
cuf
them
off
from
the
face
of
the
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Mormon
,
did
utterly
refuse
from
this
time
forth
,
to
be
a
commander
and
a
leader
of
this
people
,
hecause
of
their
wickedness
and
abomination
.
Behold
,
T
had
led
them
,
notwithstanding
their
wickedness
,
I
had
lead
them
many
times
to
battle
,
and
had
loved
them
,
according
to
the
love
of
God
which
was
in
me
,
with
all
my
heart
;
and
my
soul
had
been
poured
out
im
prayer
unto
my
God
all
the
day
long
,
for
them
;
nevertheless
,
it
was
without
faith
,
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
.
And
thrice
have
I
delivered
[File:528]
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
,
and
they
have
repe
,
ted
not
of
their
sins
.
And
when
they
had
.
sworn
by
ali
thy
had
been
forbidden
them
,
by
our
Lord
and
Saviour
Jesus
Christ
,
that
they
would
go
up
unto
their
enemies
to
batile
,
ang
avenge
themselves
of
the
blood
of
their
brethren
,
behold
,
te
voice
of
the
Lord
came
unto
me
,
saying
:
Vengeance
is
mine
,
and
I
will
repay
;
and
because
this
people
repented
not
ale
that
I
had
delivered
them
,
behold
,
they
shall
be
cut
off
frog
the
face
of
the
earth
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
utterly
rely
sed
to
go
up
against
mine
enemies
;
and
J
did
even
as
the
Lon
had
commanded
me
;
and
{
did
stand
as
an
idle
Witness
(

Anp
now
it
came
to

and

the

did
go

jaitle
against
the
Lamanites
,
out
of
the
land
Desolation
.
And
itcame
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
were
driven
jack
again
to
the
land
of
Desolation
.
And
while
they
were
yet
weary
,
a
fresh
army
of
the
Lamanites
did
come
uyion
them
;
and
they
had
a
sore
battle
,
insomuch
that
the
Lamahites
did
take
possession
of
the
city
Desolation
,
and
did
slay
many
of
the
Nephites
,
and
did
take
many
prisoners
;
and
the
remainder
did
flee
and
join
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
Teancum
.
Now
the
city
Teancum
lay
in
the
borders
by
theseashore
;
and
it
was
also
near
the
city
Desolation
,
And
it
was
because
that
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
went
up
unto
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
began
to
be
smitten
:
for
were
it
not
for
that
,
the
Lamanites
could
have
had
no
power
over
them
.
But
behotd
,
the
judgements
of
God
will
overtake
the
wicked
;
and
it
is
by
the
wicked
,
that
the
wicked
are
punished
:
forit
is
the
wicked
that
stirreth
up
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
unto
bloodshed
.—
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
make
preparations
to
come
against
the
city
Teancum
,
:
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
and
fourth
year
,
the
Lamanites
did
come
against
the
city
Teancum
,
thatthey
might
(
ake
possession
of
the
city
Feancum
also
.
Audit
came
to
pass
that
they
were
repulsed
and
driven
back
by
the
Nephites
.
And
when
the
Nephites
saw
that
they
had
driven
,
the
Lamanites
,
they
did
again
boast
of
their
strength
;
and
they
went
forth
in
their
own
might
,
and
took
possession
again
of
the
city
Desolation
.
And
now
all
these
things
had
been
done
,
and
there
had
been
thousands
slain
on
both
sides
,
both
the
Nephites
and
the
Lamanites
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
and
sixth
year
had
passed
away
,
and
the
Lamanites
came
again
upon
the
Nephites
to
battle
;
and
yet
the
Nephites
repented
not
of
the
evil
which
they
had
done
,:
tut
persisted
in
their
wickedness
continually
.
And
it
is
impossible
for
the
tongue
to
describe
,
or
for
man
to
write
a
pereet
description
of
the
horrible
scene
of
the
blood
and
cartage
which
was
among
the
people
,
both
of
the
Nephites
and
of
the
Lamanites
;
and
every
heart
was
hardened
,
so
that
they
delighted
in
the
shedding
of
blood
continually
.
And
there
never
had
been
so
great
wickedness
among
all
the
children
of
Lehi
,
nor
even
among
all
the
house
of
Israel
,
according
to
the
words
of
the
Lord
,
as
were
among
this
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
take
possession
_
of
the
city
Desolation
,
and
this
because
their
number
did
ex
-
+
ceed
the
number
of
the
Nephites
.
And
they
did
also
march
.
[File:530]
forward
against
the
city
Teancum
,
and
did
drive
the
inhabit
.
ants
forth
out
of
ner
,
and
did
take
many
prisoners
of
women
and
of
children
,
and
did
offer
them
up
as
sacrifices
unto
their
idol
gods
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
and
seventh
.
year
,
the
Nephites
being
angry
because
the
Lamanites
had
sacrificed
their
women
and
their
children
,
that
they
did
go
against
the
Lamanites
with
exceeding
great
anger
insomuch
that
they
did
beat
again
the
Lamanites
,
and
drive
them
out
of
their
lands
;
and
the
Lamanites
did
not
come
again
against
the
Nephites
,
until
the
three
hundred
and
seventy
an
)
fifth
year
.
And
in
this
year
they
did
come
down
against
the
Nephites
with
all
their
powers
;
and
they
were
not
numbered
,
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
number
.
And
from
this
fime
forth
did
the
Nephites
gain
no
power
over
the
Lamanites
,
but
began
to
be
swept
off
by
them
even
as
a
dew
before
the
sun
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
come
down
agains
!
the
city
Desolation
;
and
there
was
an
exceeding
sore
battle
fought
in
the
land
Desolation
,
in
the
which
they
did
beat
the
Nephites
.
And
they
fled
again
from
before
them
,
and
they
caine
to
the
city
Beaz
;
and
there
they
did
stand
against
the
Lamanites
with
exceeding
boldness
,
insomuch
that
the
Lamar
ites
did
not
beat
them
until
they
had
come
again
the
second
time
.
And
whenthcy
had
come
the
second
time
,
the
Nephites
were
driven
and
slaughtered
with
an
excceding
great
slaugl
ter
;
their
women
and
their
children
were
again
sacrificed
unto
idols
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
did
again
fe
from
before
them
,
taking
all
the
inhabitants
with
them
,
bothin
towns
and
villages
.
And
now
I
,
Mormon
,
seeing
that
the
Le
manites
were
about
to
overthrow
the
land
,
thercfore
[did
go
to
the
hill
Shim
,
and
did
take
up
all
the
records
which
Amm
ron
had
hid
up
unto
the
Lord
,
;
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
go
forth
among
the
Nephites
and
did
repent
of
the
eath
which
I
had
made
,
That
I
would
no
more
assist
them
;
and
they
gave
me
command
again
of
thet
armies
:
for
they
looked
upon
me
as
though
£
could
delivet
them
from
their
afllictions
.
But
behold
,
1
was
without
hopes
for
I
knew
the
judgements
of
the
Lord
which
should
come
upon
them
:
for
they
repented
not
of
their
iniquities
,
but
did
strugzle
for
their
lives
,
without
calling
upon
that
Being
whe
had
created
them
,
And
it
came
to
:
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
come
against
us
as
we
had
!
fled
to
the
:
city
of
Jordan
;
but
behold
,
they
were
driven
back
that
they
did
not
take
the
cil
at
that
time
,
And
it
came
to
pass
:
that
they
came
against
U
[File:531]
again
,
and
we
did
maintain
the
city
.
And
there
were
also
other
cities
which
were
maintained
by
the
Nephites
,
which
strong
holds
did
cut
them
off
that
they
could
not
get
into
the
country
which
lay
before
us
to
destroy
the
inhabitants
of
our
land
,
But
it
came
to
pass
that
whatsoever
lands
we
had
passed
by
,
and
the
inhabitants
thercof
were
not
gathered
in
,
were
destroyed
by
the
Lamanites
,
and
their
towns
,
and
villages
,
and
cities
were
burned
with
fire
;
and
thus
the
three
hundred
and
seventy
and
nine
years
passed
away
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
eightieth
year
,
the
Lamanites
did
come
again
against
us
to
battle
,
and
we
did
stand
against
them
boldly
;
but
it
was
alt
in
vain
,
for
so
great
were
their
numbers
that
they
did
tread
the
people
of
ihe
Nephites
under
their
feet
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
again
take
to
flight
,
and
they
whose
flight
were
swifter
than
the
Lamanites
did
escape
,
and
they
whose
flight
did
not
ex
-
ceed
the
Lamanites
,
were
swept
down
and
destroyed
.
And
now
behold
,
I
,
Mormon
,
do
not
desire
to
harrow
up
the
souls
of
men
in
casting
before
them
such
an
awful
scene
of
blood
and
carnage
as
was
laid
before
mine
eyes
,
but
1
,
knowing
that
these
things
must
surely
be
made
knowa
,
and
that
all
things
which
are
hid
must
be
revealed
upon
the
house
tops
,
and
also
that
a
knowledge
ofthese
things
must
come
unto
the
remnant
of
these
people
,
and
also
unto
the
Gentiles
,
which
the
Lord
hath
said
should
scaticr
this
people
,
and
this
people
should
be
counted
as
nought
among
them
,
therefore
I
write
a
small
abridgement
,
daring
not
to
give
a
full
account
of
the
things
which
I
have
seen
,
because
of
the
commandment
which
Thave
received
,
and
also
that
ye
might
not
have
too
great
sorrow
because
of
the
wickedness
of
this
people
.
And
now
behold
,
this
1
speak
unto
their
seed
,
and
also
to
the
Gentiles
,
which
hath
care
for
the
house
of
Isracl
,
that
realize
and
know
fiom
whence
their
blessings
come
:
For
I
know
that
such
will
sorrow
for
the
calamity
of
the
house
of
Israel
;
yea
,
they
will
sorrow
for
the
destruction
of
this
people
;
they
will
sorrow
that
this
people
had
not
repented
,
that
they
might
have
been
clasped
in
the
arms
of
Jesus
.
Now
these
things
are
Written
unto
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
Jacob
;
and
they
are
Written
after
this
manner
,
because
it
is
known
of
God
that
Wickedness
will
not
bring
them
forth
unto
them
;
and
they
are
to
be
hid
up
unto
the
Lord
,
that
they
may
come
forth
in
his
own
due
time
.
And
this
is
the
commandment
which
F
have
received
;
and
behold
they
shall
come
forth
according
te
[File:532]
the
commandment
of
the
Lord
,
when
he
shall
see
fit
,
in
his
wisdom
.
And
behold
they
shall
go
unto
the
unbelieving
of
the
Jews
;
and
for
this
intent
shall
they
go
:
that
they
may
be
.
persuaded
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
,
the
Son
of
the
living
God
:
that
the
Father
may
bring
about
,
through
his
most
beloved
,
lic
great
and
eternal
purpose
,
in
the
restoring
the
Jews
,
or
all
the
house
of
Israel
,
to
the
land
of
their
inheritance
,
which
the
Lord
their
God
hath
given
them
,
unto
the
fulfilling
of
his
cove
.
nant
,
and
also
that
the
seed
of
this
people
may
more
fully
be
lieve
his
gospel
,
which
shall
go
forth
unto
them
from
the
Gentiles
:
for
this
people
shall
be
scattered
,
and
shall
become
a
dark
,
a
filthy
,
and
a
loathsome
people
,
beyond
the
description
of
that
which
ever
hath
been
amongst
us
;
yea
,
even
that
which
hath
been
among
the
Lamanites
;
and
this
because
of
their
unbelief
and
idolatry
:
For
behold
,
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
hath
already
ceased
to
strive
with
their
father
and
they
are
without
Christ
and
God
in
the
world
,
and
they
are
driven
about
as
chaff
before
the
wind
.
They
were
oncea
dchghtsome
people
,
and
they
had
Christ
for
their
Shepherd
;
yea
,
they
were
led
even
by
God
,
the
Father
.
But
now
,
be
hold
they
are
Icd
about
by
satan
,
even
as
chaff
is
driven
be
ore
the
wind
,
or
as
a
vessel
is
tossed
about
upon
the
waves
without
sail
or
anchor
,
or
without
any
thing
wherewith
to
slew
her
;
and
even
as
she
is
,
so
are
they
.
And
behold
,
the
Lord
hath
reserved
their
blessing
,
which
they
might
have
received
in
the
land
,
for
the
Gentiles
,
which
shall
possess
the
land
—
But
behold
,
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
they
shall
be
driven
and
scatiered
by
the
Gentiles
;
and
aftet
that
they
have
been
drir
en
and
scattered
by
the
Gentiles
,
behold
,
then
will
the
Lorl
remember
the
covenant
which
he
made
unto
Abraham
,
ant
unto
all
the
house
of
Isracl
.
And
also
the
Lord
will
remem
ber
the
prayers
of
the
righteous
,
which
hath
been
put
up
unlo
him
for
them
.
And
then
,
O
ye
Gentiles
,
how
can
ye
stant
hefore
the
power
of
God
,
except
ye
shall
repent
and
turn
from
your
evil
ways
?
Know
ye
not
that
ye
are
in
the
bands
of
God
?
Know
ye
not
that
he
hath
all
power
,
and
at
his
great
command
the
earth
shall
be
rolled
together
as
a
scroll
?
There
fore
repent
ye
,
and
humble
yourselves
before
him
,
lest
he
shall
come
out
in
justice
against
you
;
lest
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
Jacoh
shall
go
forth
among
you
as
a
lion

and
tear
you
in
pit

and
there
is
none

CHAPTER
Hl
.
Ayo
now
,
I
finish
my
record
concerning
the
destruction
of
my
people
,
the
Nephites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
march
forth
before
the
Lamanites
,
And
I
,
Mormon
,
wrote
an
epistle
unto
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
desired
of
him
that
he
would
grant
unto
us
that
we
might
gather
together
our
people
unto
the
land
of
Camorah
,.
by
a
hill
which
was
called
Camorah
,
and
there
we
would
give
them
battle
.
And
it
came
to
.
pass
that
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
did
grant
unto
me
the
thing
which
I
desired
.
And
it
came
to
pase
that
we
did
march
forth
to
the
land
of
Camorah
,
and
we
did
pitch
our
tents
round
about
the
hill
Camorah
;
and
it
was
in
a
land
of
many
waters
,
rivers
aud
fountains
;
and
here
we
had
hope
to
gain
advantage
over
the
Lamanitcs
.
And
when
three
hundred
and
eighty
and
four
years
had
passed
away
,
we
had
gathered
in
all
the
remainder
of
our
people
unto
the
land
Camorah
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
we
had
gathered
in
all
our
people
in
one
to
the
land
of
Camorah
,
behold
I
,
Mormon
,
began
to
be
old
;
and
knowing
it
to
be
the
last
struggle
of
my
people
,
and
haying
been
commanded
of
the
Lord
that
I
should
not
suffer
that
the
records
which
had
been
handed
down
by
our
fathers
,
which
were
sacred
,
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
(
for
the
Lamanites
would
destroy
them
,)
therefore
I
made
this
record
out
of
the
plates
of
Nephi
,
and
hid
up
in
the
hill
Camorah
,
all
the
records
which
had
been
entrusted
to
me
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
save
it
were
these
few
plates
which
I
gave
unto
my
son
.
Moroni
.
And
it
came
to
pass
.
my
people
,
with
their
wives
and
their
children
,
did
now
b
hold
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
a
marching
towards
them
;
and
with
that
awful
fear
of
death
which
fills
the
breasts
of
alk
the
wicked
,
did
they
await
to
receive
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
to
battle
against
us
,
and
every
soul
was
filled
with
terror
,
because
.
of
the
greatness
of
their
numbers
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
fall
upon
my
people
with
the
sword
,
and
with

And
it
came

on

And

And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
ten
more
which
did
fal
by
the
sword
,
with
their
ten
thousand
each

yea

even
all

it
were

were
with

also
a

which
had
escaped
into
the
south
enuntries
,
and
a
few
which
had
dissented
over
unto
the
Laman

,
had
fallen
,
and
their
flesh
,
and
bones
,
and
blood
lay
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
,
being
left
by
the
hands
of
those
qwho
slew
them
,
to
moulder
upou
the
land
,
and
to
crumble
and
to
return
fo
their

earth
.
And
my
soul
was
rent
with
a
guish
,
because
of
the
slain
of
my
people
:
And
I
cried
,
O
ye
fair
ones
,
how
could
ye
have
departed
from
the
ways
of
the
Lord
!
O
ye
fair
ones
,
how
could
yo
have
rejected
that
Jesus
,
who
stood
with
open
arms
to
receive
you
!
Behold
,
if
ye
had
not
done
this
,
ye
would
not
haye
fallen
.
But
behold
,
ye
ar
fallen
,
and
I
mourn
your
loss
.
O
ye
fair
sons
and
daughters
,
ye
fathers
and
mothers
,
ye
husbands
and
wives
,
ye
fair
ones
,
ow
is
it
that
ye
could
have
fallen
!
But
behold
,
Ye
are
gone
,
and
my
sorrows
cannot
bring
your
return
;
and
the
day
soon
cometh
that
your
mortal
must
put
on
immortality
,
and
these
hodies
which
are
now
mouldering
in
corruption
,
must
soon
become
incorruptible
bodies
;
and
then
ye
must
stand
before
the
judgement
seat
of
Christ
,
to
be
judged
according
to
your
works
!
.
and
if
it'so
be
that
ye'are
righteous
,
then
are
ye
blessed
with
your
fathers
which
have
gone
before
you

that
ye
had
re
pented
before
that
this
great
destruction
had
come

ye
are
gone

the

Father

of

knoweth
your

he

with
you

And
now
behold
,
I
would
speak
somewhat
unto
the
resinant
of
this
people

are
spared
,
if
it
so
be
that
God
may

[File:535]
their
fathers
;
yea
,
I
speak
unto
you
,
ye
remnant
of
the
house
of
Israel
;
and
this
is
the
words
which]
speak
:
Know
ye
that
ye
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
.
Know
ye
that
ye
must
come
unto
repentance
,
or
ye
cannot
be
saved
.
Know
ye
that
ye
must
lay
down
your
weapons
of
war
,
and
delight
no
more
in
the
shedding
of
blood
,
and
take
them
not
again
,
save
it
be
that
God
shall
command
you
.
Know
ye
that
ye
must
come
to
the
knowledge
of
your
fathers
,
and
repent
of
all
your
sins
and
iniquities
,
and
believe
in
Jesus
Christ
,
that
he
is
the
Son
of
God
,
and
that
he
was
slain
by
the
Jews
,
and
by
the
power
of
the
Pather
he
hath
risen
again
,
whereby
he
hath
gained
the
yietory
over
the
grave
;
and
also
in
him
is
the
sting
of
death
swallowed
up
.
And
he
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
,
whereby
man
must
be
raised
to
stand
before
his
judgement
seat
.
And
he
hath
brought
to
pass
the
redemption
ofthe
world
,
whereby
he
that
is
found
guiltless
before
him
at
the
judgement
day
,
hath
it
given
unto
them
to
dwell
in
the
presence
of
God
in
his
kingdom
,
to
sing
ceaseless
praises
with
the
choirs
above
,
unto
the
Father
,
and
unto
the
Son
,
and
unto
the
Holy
Ghost
,
which
is
one
God
,
in
a
state
of
happiness
which
hath
no
end
.
Therefore
repent
,
and
be
baptized
in
the
name
of
Jesus
,
and
Jay
hold
upon
the
Gospel
of
Christ
,
which
shall
be
set
before
you
,
not
only
in
this
record
,
but
also
in
the
record
which
shall
come
unto
the
Gentiles
from
the
Jews
,
which
record
shall
come
from
the
Gentiles
unto
you
.
For
behold
,
this
is
written
for
the
intent
that
ye
may
believe
that
;
and
if
ye
believe
that
,
ye
will
believe
this
also
;
and
if
ye
believe
this
,
ye
will
know
concerning
your
fathers
,
and
also
the
marvellous
works
which
were
wrought
by
the
power
of
God
among
them
;
and
ye
will
also
know
that
ye
are
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
Jacob
;
therefore
ye
are
numbered
among
the
people
of
the
first
covenant
;
and
if
it
so
be
that
ye
believe
in
Christ
,
and
are
baptized
,
first
with
water
,
then
with
fire
and
with
the
Holy
Ghost
,
following
the

Saviour
~
according
to
that

CHAPTER
IV

Bruoup
I
,
Moroni
,
do
finish
the
record
of
my
father
Mor
.
ton
.
Behold
,
Ihave
but
few
things
to
write
,
which
things
I
[File:536]
have
been
commanded
of
my
father
.
And
now
it
came
tg
pass
that
after
the
great
and
tremendous
battle
at
Camorah
,
behold
,
the
Nephites
which
had
escaped
into
the
country
southward
,
were
hunted
by
the
Lamanites
,
until
they
were
all
destroyed
;
and
my
father
also
was
killed
by
them
;
and
I
,
even
I
remaineth
alone
to
write
the
sad
tale
of
the
destruction
of
my
people
.
But
behold
,
they
are
gone
,
and
I
fulfil
the
commandment
of
my
father
.
And
whether
they
will
slay
me
,
T
know
not
;
therefore
I
will
write
and
hide
up
the
records
in
the
earth
:
and
whither
I
go
it
mattereth
not
.
Behold
,
my
fa
ther
hath
made
this
record
,
and
he
hath
written
the
intent
thereof
,
And
behold
,
I
would
write
it
also
,
if
J
had
room
upen
the
plates
;
but
Ihave
not
;
and
ore
I
have
none
,
for
am
alone
:
my
father
hath
been
slain
in
battle
,
and
all
my
kins
folks
,
and
have
not
friends
nor
whither
to
go
;
and
how
long
that
the
Lord
will
suffer
that
may
live
,
1know
not
.
Behold
,
four
hundred
years
have
passed
away
since
the
coming
of
our
Lord
and
Saviour
..
And
behold
,
the
Lamanites
have
hunted
my
people
,
the
Nephites
,
down
from
city
to
city
,
and
from
place
to
place
,
even
until
they
are
no
more
;
and
great
has
heon
their
fall
;
yea
,
great
and
marvellous
is
the
destruction
of
my
people
,
the
Nephites
.
And
bebold
,
it
is
the
handof
the
Lord
which
hath
done
it
.
And
behold
also
,
the
Laman
ites
are
at
war
one
with
another
;
and
the
whole
face
of
this
Jand
is
one
continual
round
of
murder
and
bloodshed
;
and
no
one
knoweth
the
end
of
the
war
.
And
now
behold
,
I
say
n0
more
concerning
them
,
for
there
are
none
,
save
it
be
Lamaiites
and
robbers
,
that
do
exist
upon
the
face
of
the
land
;
and
there
are
none
that
do
know
the
true
God
,
save
it
be
the
dis
ciples
of
Jesus
,
which
did
tarry
in
the
land
until
the
wicked
:
ness
of
the
people
were
so
great
,
that
the
Lord
would
net
suffer
them
to
remain
with
the
people
;
and
whether
they
he
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
no
man
knoweth
.
But
behold
,
my
father
and
Ihave
seen
them
,
and
they
have
ministered
unto
us
.
And
whoso
receiveth
this
record
,
and
shall
not
condemm
it
because
of
the
imperfections
which
:
are
in
it
,
the
same
shall
inow
of
greater
things
than
.
these
.
Behold
,
]
am
Moroni
;
and
were
it
possible
,
1
would
make
all
things
known
unto
you
.
Behold
,
I
make
an
end
of
speaking
concerning
this
people
.
1
am
the
son
of
Mormon
,
and
my
father
was
a
descendant
of
Nephi
;
and
I
am
the
same
which
hideth
up
this
record
unl
the
Lord
;
the
plates
thereof
are
of
no
worth
,
because
of
the
commandment
of
the
Lord
.
For
he
truly
saith
,
That
no
ont
[File:537]
shall
have
them
to
get
gain
;
but
the
record
thereof
is
of
great
worth
;
and
whoso
shall
bring
it
to
light
,
him
will
the
Lord
bless
.
For
none
can
have
power
to
bring
it
to
light
,
save
it
be
given
him
of
God
:
for
God
will
that
it
shall
be
done
with
an
eye
singled
to
his
glory
,
or
the
welfare
of
the
ancient
and
long
dispersed
covenant
people
of
the
Lord
.
And
blessed
be
him
that
shall
bring
this
thing
to
light
:
for
it
shall
be
brought
out
of
darkness
unto
light
,
according
to
the
word
of
God
;
yea
,
itshall
be
brought
out
of
the
earth
,
and
it
shall
shine
forth
out
of
darkness
,
and
come
unto
the
knowledge
of
the
people
;
and
it
shall
be
done
by
the
power
of
God
:
and
if
there
be
faults
,
they
be
the
faults
of
aman
.
But
behold
,
we
know
no
fault
.
Nevertheless
,
God
knoweth
all
things
;
therefore
he
that
condemncth
,
let
him
be
aware
lest
he
shall
be
in
danger
of
hell
fire
.
And
he
that
sayeth
,
Shew
unto
me
,
or
ye
shall
be
smitten
,
let
him
beware
lest
he
commandcth
that
which
is
forbidden
of
the
Lord
.
For
behold
,
the
same
that
judgeth
rashly
,
shallbe
judged
rashly
again
:
for
according
to
his
works
shall
his
wages
be
;
therefore
,
he
that
smiteth
,
shall
be
smiticn
again
of
the
Lord
.
Behold
what
the
Scripture
saith
:
Man
shall
not
smite
,
neither
shall
he
judge
:
for
judgement
is
mine
,
saith
~
the
Lord
;
and
vengeance
is
mine
also
,
and
I
will
repay
.
And
he
that
shall
breathe
out
wrath
and
strifes
against
the
work
of
the
Lord
,
and
against
the
covenant
people
of
the
Lord
,
which
is
the
house
of
Isracl
,
and
shall
say
,
We
will
destroy
th
work
of
the
Lord
,
and
the
Lord
will
not
remember
his
co
nant
which
he
hath
made
unto
the
house
of
Israel
,
the
sar
isin
danger
to
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
:
for
the
eternal
purposes
of
the
Lord
shall
roll
on
,
until
all
his
promises
shall
be
fulfilled
.
Search
the
prophecies
of
Isaiah
.
Behold
,
Icannot
write
them
.
Yea
,
behold
I
say
unto
you
,
That
those
saints
which
have
gone
before
me
,
which
have
possessed
this
land
,
shall
ery
;
yea
,
even
from
the
dust
will
they
ery
untothe
Lord
;
and
as
the
Lord
liveth
,
he
will
remember
the
covenant
which
he
hath
made
with
them
.
And
he
knoweth
their
prayers
,
that
they
were
in
the
behalf
of
their
brethren
.
And
he
knoweth
their
faith
:
for
in
his
name
could
they
remove
mountains
;
and
in
his
name
could
they
cause
the
earth
to
shake
;
and
by
the
power
of
his
word
did
they
cause
prisons
10
tunble
to
the
earth
;
yea
,
even
the
fiery
furnace
could
hot
harm
them
;
neither
wild
beasts
,
nor
poisonous
serpents
,
because
of
the
power
of
his
word
.
And
behold
,
their
prayers
were
also
in
behalf
of
him
that
the
Lord
should
suffer
to
[File:538]
bring
these
things
forth
.
And
no
onc
need
not
say
,
They
shall
not
come
,
for
they
surely
shall
,
for
the
Lord
hath
spoken
it
:
for
out
of
the
earth
shall
they
come
,
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
and
none
can
stay
it
;
and
it
shall
come
in
a
day
when
it
shall
be
said
that
miracles
are
done
away
;
and
it
shall
come
even
as
if
one
should
speak
from
the
dead
.
And
it
shall
come
in
a
day
when
the
blood
of
saints
shall
cry
unto
the
Lord
,
be
cause
of
secret
combinations
and
the
works
of
darkness
;
yea
,
it
shall
come
in
a
day
when
the
power
of
God
shall
be
denied
,
and
churches
become
defiled
,
and
shall
be
lified
up
in
the
pride
of
their
hearts
;
yea
,
even
in
a
day
when
leaders
of
churches
,
and
teachers
,
in
the
pride
of
their
hearts
,
even
to
the
enyying
of
them
who
belong
to
their
churches
;
yea
,
it
shall
come
in
a
day
when
there
shall
be
heard
of
fires
,
and
tempests
,
and
vapors
of
smoke
in
foreign
lands
;
and
there
shall
also
be
heard
of
wars
,
and
rumors
of
wars
,
and
earth
quakes
in
diverse
places
;
yea
,
it
shall
come
in
a
day
when
there
shall
be
great
pollutions
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
:
there
shall
be
murders
,
and
robbing
,
and
lying
,
and
deceivings
,
and
whoredoms
,
and
all
manner
of
abominations
;
when
there
&
shall
be
many
which
will
say
,
Do
this
,
or
do
that
,
and
it
mat
tereth
not
,
for
the
Lord
will
uphold
such
at
the
last
day
.
But
wo
unto
such
,
for
they
are
in
the
gall
of
bitterness
,
and
in
the
bonds
of
iniquity
.
Yea
,
it
shall
come
ina
day
when
there

churches
built
up
that

Come

ye
_
Wicked
,
and
perverse
,
and
stiffnecked
people
,
why
have
ye
built
up
churches
unto
yourselves
to
get
gain
?
Why
have
ye
transfigured
the
holy
word
of
God
,
that
ye
might
bring
dam
nation
upon
your
souls
?
Behold
,
look
ye
unto
the
revelations
of
God
.
For
behold
,
the
time
cometh
at'
that
day
when
all
these
things
must
be
fulfilled
.
Behold
,
the
Lord
hath
shewn
unto
me
great
and
marvellous
things
concerning
that
which
must
shortly
come
at
that
day
when
these
things
shall
come
forth
among
you
.
Behold
,
J
speak
unto
you
as
if
ye
were
present
,
and
yet
ye
are
not
.
But
behold
,
Jesus
Chnist
hath
shewn
you
unto
me
,
and
I
know
your
doing
;
and
]
know
that
ye
do
walk
in
the
pride
of
your
hearts
;
and
there
ave
none
,
save
a
few
only
,
which
do
not
lift
themselves
up
0
the
pride
of
their
hearts
,
unto
the
wearing
of
very
fine
apparel
,
unto
envying
,
and
strifes
,
and
malice
,
and
persecutions
,
alt
all
manner
of
iniquities
;
and
your
churches
,
yea
,
even
every
one
,
have
become
polluted
because
of
the
pride
of
your
hearts
.
[File:539]
For
behold
,
ye
do
love
money
,
and
your
substances
,
and
your
fine
apparel
,
and
the
adorning
of
your
churches
,
more
than
ye
love
the
poor
and
the
needy
,
the
sick
and
the
afflicted
,
O
ye
pollutions
,
ye
hypocrites
,
ye
teachers
,
which
sell
yourselves
for
that
which
will
canker
,
why
have
ye
polluted
the
holy
church
of
God
?
Why
are
ye
ashamed
to
take
upon
you
the
name
of
Christ
?
Why
do
ye
not
think
that
greater
is
the
value
of
an
endless
happiness
,
than
that
misery
which
never
dies
,
because
of
the
praise
of
the
world
?
Why
do
ye
adorn
yourselves
with
that
which
hath
no
life
,
and
yet
suiler
the
hungry
,
and
the
needy
,
and
the
naked
,
and
the
sick
,
and
the
afflicted
to
pass
by
you
,
and
notice
them
not
?
Yea
,
why
do
ye
build
up
your
secret
abominations
to
get
gain
,
and
cause
that
widows
should
mourn
before
the
Lord
,
and
also
orphans
to
mourn
before
the
Lord
;
and
also
the
blood
of
their
fathers
and
their
husbands
to
cry
unto
the
Lord
from
the
ground
,
for
vengeance
upon
your
heads
?
Behold
,
the
sword
of
vengeance
hangeth
over
you
;
and
the
time
soon
cometh
that
he
avengeth
the
blood
of
the
saints
upon
you
,
for
he
will
not
suffer
their
cries
anylonger
.
And
now
,
I
speak
also
concerning
those
who
do
not
believe
in
Christ
.
Behold
,
will
ye
believe
in
the
day
of
—
your
visitation
,
behold
,
when
the
Lord
shall
come
;
yea
,
even
that
great
day
when
the
earth
shall
be
rolled
together
as
a
9
scroll
,
and
the
elements
shall
melt
with
fervent
heat
;-
yea
,
in
that
great
day
when
ye
shall
be
brought
to
stand
before
the
Lamb
of
God
,
then
will
ye
say
that
there
is
no
God
?
Then
will
ye
longer
deny
the
Christ
,
or
can
ye
behold
the
Lamb
of
God
?
Do
ye
suppose
that
ye
shall
dwell
with
him
under
a
consciousness
of
your
guilt
?
Do
ye
suppose
that
ye
could
be
happy
to
dwell
with
that
holy
Being
,
when
your
souls
are
tacked
with
a
consciousness
of
your
guilt
that
ye
have
ever
abused
his
laws
?
Behold
I
say
unto
you
,
that
ye
would
be
more
miserable
to
dwell
with
a
holy
and
just
God
,
under
a
consciousness
of
your
filthiness
before
him
,
than
ye
would
to
dwell
with
the
damned
souls
in
hell
?
For
behold
,
when
ye
shall
be
brought
to
see
.
your
nakedness
before
God
,
and
also
the
glory
of
God
,
and
the
holiness
of
Jesus
Christ
,
it
will
kindie
a
flame
of
unquenchable
fire
upon
you
:
O
then
ye
unbelieving
,
turn
ye
unto
the
Lord
;
ery
mightily
unto
the
Father
m
the
name
of
Jesus
,
that
perhaps
ye
may
be
found
spotless
,
pure
,
fair
,
and
white
,
having
been
cleansed
by
the
blood
of
the
Lamb
,
at
that
great
and
last
day
.
And
again
I
speak
unto
you
,
who
deny
the
revelations
of
God
,
and
say
that
they
are
[File:540]
7
done
away
,
that
there
is
no
revelations
,
wor
propliecies
,
not
gilts
,
nor
healing
,
nor
speaking
with
tongues
,
and
the
interpre
.
tation
of
tongues
.
Behold
J
say
unto
you
,
He
.
that
denieth
these
things
,
knoweth
not
the
Gospel
of
Christ
;
yea
,
they
have
not
read
the
Scriptures
;
if
so
,
they
do
not
understand
them
.
For
do
we
not
read
that
God
is
the
same
yesterday
,
to-day
,
and
forever
:
and
in
him
there
is
no
yariablencas
,
nes
ther
shadow
of
changing
.
And
now
,
if
ye
have
imagined
up
unto
yourselves
a
god
which
doth
vary
,
and
in
him
there
is
shadow
of
changing
,
then
have
ye
imagined
up
unto
yourselves
a
god
which
is
not
a
God
of
miracles
.
But
behold
,
I
wil
shew
unto
you
a
God
of
miracles
,
even
the
God
of
Abraham
,
and
the
God
of
Isaac
,
and
the
God
of
Jacob
;
and
it
is
that
same'God
which
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
,
and
all
things
that
in
them
is
.
Behold
,
he
crated
Adam
;
and
by
Adam
came
the
fall
of
man
,
And
-
because
of
the
fall
of
man
,
caine
Jesus
Christ
,
even
the
Father
and
the
Son
;
and
because
of
Jesus
Christ
,
came
the
redemption
of
man
,
And
because
ef
the
redemption
of
man
,
which
came
by
Jesus
Christ
,
they
are
brought
back
into
the
presence
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
this
is
wherein
all_men
are
redeemed
,
because
the
death
of
Christ
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
,
which
bringeth
to
passa
redemption
from
an
endless
sleep
,
from
which
sleep
all
men
_
shall
be
awoke
by
the
power
of
God
,
when
the
tramp
shall
sound
;
and
they
shall
come
forth
,
both
small
and
great
,
and
wy
shall
stand
before
his
bar
,
being
redeemed
and
loosed
from
this
eternal
band
of
death
,
which
death
is
a
temporal
death
;
and
then
cometh
the
judgement
of
the
Holy
One
upon
them
;
and
then
cometh
the
time
that
he
that
is
filthy
,
shall
be
filthy
still
;
and
he
that
is
righteous
,
shall
be
righteous
still
:
he
that
is
happy
,
shall
be
happy
still
;
and
he
that
is
unhappy
,
shal
be
unhappy
still
.
And
now
,
O
all
ye
that
have
imagined
op
unto
yourselves
a
god
which
can
do
no
miracles
,
1
would
ask
of
you
,
have
all
these
things
past
,
of
which
J
have
spoken
!
Has
the
.
end
come
-
yet
?
Behold
I
say
unto
you
,
Nay
;
and
God
has
not
ceased
to
be
a
God
of
miracles
.
Behold
,
are
not
the
things
that
God
hath
wrought
,
marvellous
in
ovr
eyes
?
Yea
,
and
who
can
comprehend
the
marvellous
works
of
God
?
Who
shall
say
that
it
was
nota
miracle
,
that
by
his
word
the
heaven
and
the
earth
should
be
;
and
by
the
power
of
his
wordy
man
was
created
of
the
dust
of
the
earth
;
and
by
the
power
of
his
word
,
hath
miracles
been
wrought
?
And
who
.
shall
say
that
Jesus
Christ
did
not
do
many
mighty
miracles
?
Aad
[File:541]
there
was
many
mighty
miracles
wrought
by
the
hands
of
the
apostles
.
And
if
there
was
miracles
wrought
,
then
why
bas
Gor
ceased
to
be
a
God
of
miracles
,
and
yet
be
an
unchangeable
being
.
And
behold
I
say
unto
you
,
He
changeth
not
:
if
so
,
he
would
cease
to
be
God
;
and
he
ceaseth
not
to
be
God
,
andis
a
God
of
miracles
.
And
the
reason
why
he
ceaseth
to
do
miracles
among
the
children
of
men
,
is
because
that
they
dwindle
in
unbelief
,
and
depart
from
the
right
way
,
and
know
not
the
God
in
whom
they
should
trusi
.
Behold
I
say
unto
you
,
That
whoso
believeth
in
Christ
,
doubting
nothing
,
whatsoever
he
shall
ask
the
Father
in
the
name
of
Christ
,
it
shall
be
granted
them
:
and
this
promise
is
unto
all
,
even
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
.
For
behold
,
thus
saith
Jesus
Christ
,
the
Son
of
God
,
unto
his
disciples
which
should
tarry
;
yea
,
and
also
to
all
his
disciples
,
in
the
hearing
of
the
multitude
,
Go
ye
into
ali
the
world
,
and
preach
the
Gospel
to
every
creature
;
and
he
that
believeth
and
is
baptized
,
shall
be
:
saved
,
but
he
that
believeth
not
,
shall
be
damned
.
And
these
signs
shall
follow
them
that
believe
:
In
my
name
shall
they
cast
out
Devils
;
they
shall
speak
with
new
tongues
;
they
shall
take
up
serpents
;
and
if
they
drink
any
deadly
thing
,
it
shall
not
hurt
them
;
they
shall
lay
bands
on
the
sick
,
and
they
shall
reco~
yer
;
and
whosoever
shall
believe
in
my
name
,
doubting
nothing
,
unto
him
will
I
confirm
all
my
words
,
even
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
,
And
now
behold
,
who
.
can
stand
against
the
works
of
the
Lord
?
Who
can
deny
his
sayings
?.
Who
will
tise
up
against
the
almighty
power
of
the
Lord
%
Who
will
despise
the
works
of
the
Lord
?
Who
will
despise
the
children
of
Christ
?
Behold
,
all
ye
that
are
despisers
of
the
works
of
the
Lord
,
for
ye
shall
wonder
and
perish
.
O
then
.
despise
not
,
and
wonder
not
,
but
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
Lord
,
and
ask
the
Father
inthe
name
of
Jesus
for
what
things
soever
ye
shall
stand
in
need
.
Doubt
not
,
but
be
believing
,
and
begin
as
in
times
of
old
,
and
come
unto
the
Lord
with
all
your
heart
,
and
work
out
your
own
salvation
with
fear
and
trembling
before
him
.
Be
wise
in
the
days
of
your
probation
;
tip
yourselves
of
all
uncleanness
;
ask
not
,
that
ye
may
conme
it
on
your
lusts
,
but
ask
with
a
firmness
unshaken
,
that
ewill
yield
to
no
temptation
,
but
that
ye
will
serve
the
true
and
living
God
.
See'
that
ye
are
not
baptized
unworthily
;
see
that
ye
partake
not
of
the
sacrament
of
Christ
unworthily
;
but
sce
that
ye
do
all
things
in
worthiness
,
and
do
it
im
the
name
.
of
Jesus
Christ
,
the
Son
of
the
living
God
;
and
if
ye
de
1
[File:542]
this
,
and
endure
to
the
end
,
ye
will
in
no
wise
be
cast
out
.
Behold
,
I
speak
unto
you
as
though
f
spake
from
the
dead
;
for
I
know
that
ye
shall
hear
my
words
.
Condemn
me
ng
because
of
mine
imperfection
;
neither
my
father
,
because
gf
his
imperfection
;
neither
them
which
have
written
before
him
,
but
rather
give
thanks
unto
God
that
he
hath
made
manifes
:
unto
you
our
imperfections
,
that
ye
may
learn
to
be
more
wig
than
that
which
we
have
been
.
And
now
dehold
,
we
have
written
this
record
according
ty
our
knowledge
in
the
characters
,
which
are
called
among
us
the
reformed
Egyptian
,
being
handed
down
and
altered
by
us
,
according
to
our
manner
of
speech
.
And
if
our
plates
had
been
sufficiently
large
,
we
should
have
written
in
the
Hebrew
;
but
the
Hebrew
hath
been
altered
by
us
also
;
and
if
we
could
have
written
in
the
Hebrew
,
behold
,
ye
would
have
had
none
imperfection
in
our
record
.
But
the
Lord
knoweth
the
things
which
we
have
written
,
and
also
that
none
other
people
know
eth
our
language
;
and
because
that
none
other
peopie
know
eth
our
language
,
therefore
he
hath
prepared
means
for
the
in
terpretation
thereof
..
And
these
.
things
are
written
,
that
we
may
rid
our
garments
of
the
blood
of
our
brethren
which
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
.
And
behold
,
these
things
which
we
have
desired
concerning
our
brethren
,
yea
,
even
their
restom
tion
to
the
knowledge
of
Christ
,
is
according
to
the
prayers
of
all
the
saints
which
haye
dwelt
in
the
land
.
And
may
tle
Lord
Jesus
Christ
grant
that
their
prayers
may
be
answered
according
t@
their
faith
;
and
may
God
the
Father
remember
the
covenant
which
he
hath
made
with
the
house
of
Israd
;
and
may
he'
bless
them
forever
,
through
faith
on
the
named
!

BOOK
OF

CHAPTER
1
.
_
Axp
now
I
,
Moroni
,
proceed
to
give
an
account
of
th
ancient
inhabitants
which
were
destroyed
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
upon
the
face
of
this
north
country
.
And
I
take
mint
account
from
the
twenty
and
four
plates
which
were
found
by
the
people
of
Limhi
,
which
is
called
the
Book
of
Ether
.
Auil
as
I
suppose
that
the
first
part
of
this
record
,
which
speaketh
[File:543]
concerning
the
creation
of
the
world
,
and
also
of
Adam
,
and
anaccount
from
that
time
even
to
the
great
tower
,
aud
whatsoever
things
transpired
among
the
children
of
men
until
that
time
,
is
had
among
the
'
Jews
,
therefore
I
do
not
write
those
things
which
transpired
from
the
days
of
Adan
until
that
tine
;
but
they
are
had
upon
the
plates
;
and
whoso
findeth
them
,
the
same
will
have
power
that
he
may
get
the
full
account
.
But
behold
,
I
give
not
the
full
account
,
but
a
part
of
the
account
I
give
,
from
the
tower
down
until
they
were
destroyed
.
And
on
this
wise

and
Com
was
the
son
of
Coriantum
;
and
Coriantum
was
the
son
of
Emer
;
and
Emer
was
the
son
of

and
Omer
was
the
son

and
Shule
was
the
son
of

;
and
Kib
was
the
son
of
Orihah
,
which
was
the
son
of
Jared
;
which
Jared
came
forth
with
his
brother
and
their
families
,
with
some
others
and
their
families
,
from
the
great
tower
,
at
the
time
the
Lord
confounded
the
language
of
the
people
,
and
swear
in
his
wrath
that
they
should
be
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
;
ind
according
{o
the
word
of
the
Lord
the
people
were
scatered
,
And
the
brother
of
Jared
,
being
a
large
and
a
mighty
man
,
and
heing
a
man
highly
favored
of
the
Lord
;
for
Jared
his
brother
said
unto
him
,
Cry
unto
the
Lord
,
that
he
will
not
found
us
that
we
may
not

And

e
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
Jared
did
cry
unto
the
Lord
,
the
Lord
had
compassion
upon
Jared
;
therefore
he
did
confound
the
language
of
Jared
;
and
Jared
and
his
brother
Were
not
confounded
.
Then
Jared
said
unto
his
brot
!
,
Cry
again
unto
the
Lord
,
and
it
may
be
that
he
will
turn
away
his
tiger
from
them
which
are
our
friends
,
that
he
confound
not
[File:544]
their
language
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
Jay
did
ery
unto
the
Lord
,
and
the
Lord
had
compassion
tp
,
their
friends
,
and
their
families
also
,
that
they
were
not
em
founded
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Jared
spake
again
unto
hr
brother
,
saying
,
Goand
inquire
of
the
Lord
whether
he
yp
drive
us
out
of
the
land
;
and
if
he
will
drive
us
out
of
the
land
,
ery
unto
him
whither
we
shallgo
.
And
who
knowethby
the
Lord
will
carry
ug
forth
into
a
land
which
is
choice
aboe
all
the
earth
.
Andif
it
so
be
,
let
us
be
faithful
unto
the
Lon
,
that
we
may
receive
it
for
our
inheritance
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
Jared
did
ery
un
the
Lord
according
to
that
which
had
been
spoken
by
mouth
of
Jared
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
her
the
brother
of
Jared
,
and
had
compassion
upon
him
,
and
sail
unto
him
,
Go

and
gather

And
when

,
thou
shalt
go
at

down
into

valle
,
which
is

.
And
there
will

and

And

And

.
And
thus]
will
do
unto
thee
because
of
this
Jong
time
which
ye
have
erel
unto

,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Jared
,
and
his
brother
,
and
thet
families
,
and
also
the
friends
of
Jared
and
his
brother
,
ail
their
families
,
went
down
into
the
valley
which
was
northwanl
,
{and
the
name
of
the
valley
was
Nimrod
,
being
called
aitet
the
mighty
hunter
,)
with
their
flocks
which
they
had
gathered
together
,
male
and
female
,
of
every
kind
.
And
they
did
als
lay
snares
and
catch
fowls
of
the
air
;
and
they
did
also
prepatt
a
-
vessel
,
in
the
which
they
did
carry
with
them
the
fish
the
waters
;
and
they
did
also
carry
with
them
deseret
,
which
,
by
interpretation
,
is
a
honey
bee
;
and
thus
they
did
carry
wi
!
them
swarms
of
bees
,
and
all
manner
of
that
which
was
ups
the
face
of
the
land
,
seeds
of
every
kind
.
And
it
came
to
pe
that
when
they
had
come
down
into
the
valley
of
Nimrod
,
the
Lord
came
down
and
talked
with
the
brother
of
Jared
;
#
!
[File:545]
he
was
ina
clowd
,
and
the
brother
of
Jared
saw
him
not
.
Aud'it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
commanded
them
that
they
should
go
forth
into
the
wilderness
,
yea
,
inlo
that
quarter
where
there
never
had
man
been
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
go
before
them
,
and
did
talk
with
them
as
he
stood
ina
cloud
,
and
gave
directions
whither
they
should
travel
.—
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
travel
in
the
wilderness
,
and
did
build
barges
,
in
the
which
they
did
cross
many
waters
,
being
directed
continually
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
.
And
the
Lord
would
not
suffer
that
they
should
siop
beyond
the
sea
in
the
wilderness
,
buthe
would
that
they
should
come
forth
even
unto
the
land
of
promise
,
which
was
choice
above
all
other
lands
,
which
the
Lord
God
had
preserved
for
a
righteous
people
;
and
he
had
sworn
in
his
wrath
unto
the
brother
of
Jared
,
that
whoso
should
possess
this
land
of
promise
,
{rom
that
time
henceforth
and
forever
,
should
serve
him
,
the
true
and
only
God
,
or
they
should
be
swept
off
when
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
should
come
upon
them
.
And
now
we
can
behold
the
fecrees
of
God
concerning
this
land
,
that
it
is
a
land
of
promise
,
and
whatsoever
nation
shall
possess
it
,
shall
serve
God
,
or
they
shall
be
swept
off
when
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
shall
come
upon
them
.
And
the
fulness
of
bis
wrath
cometh
upon
them
when
they
are
ripened
in
iniquity
:
for
behold
,
this
is
a
land
which
is
choice
above
all
other
lands
;
wherefore
.
he
that
doth
possess
it
shall
serve
God
,
or
shall
be
swept
off
;
for
it
is
the
everlasting
decrees
of
God
.
And
it
is
not
until
the
fulness
of
iniquity
among
the
children
of
the
land
,
that
they
are
wept
off
.
And
this
cometh
unto
you
,
O
ye
Gentiles
,
that
ye
may
know
the
decrees
of
God
,
that
ye
may
repent
,
and
not
continue
in
your
iniquitics
until
the
fulness
be
come
,
that
ye
may
not
bring
down
the
fulness
of
the
wrath
of
God
upon
you
,
as
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
hath
hitherto
done
.
Behold
,
this
is
,
a
choice
land
,
and
whatsoever
nation
shall
possess
it
,
shall
be
free
from
bondage
,
and
from
captivity
,
and
from
all
other
nations
under
Heaven
,
if
they
will
but
serve
the
God
of
the
land
,
which
is
Jesus
Christ
,
which
hath
been
manifested
by
the
things
which
we
have
written
,
And
now
I
proceed
with
my
record
:
for
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
bring
Jared
and
his
brethern
forth
even
to
that
great
sea
which
divideth
the
Jands
.
And
as
they
came
to
the
sea
,
they
pitched
their
tents
;
and
they
called
the
name
of
the
place
Moriancumer
;
and
they
dwelt
in
tents
;
and
dwelt
in
tents
upon
the
Seashore
for
the
space
of
four
years
.
And
it
came
to
pass
[File:546]
at
the
end
of
the
four
years
,
that
the
Lord
came
again
mtg
the
brother
of
Jared
,
and
stood
in
a
cloud
and
talked
with
hin
,
And
for
the
space
of
three
hours
did
the
Lord
talk
witht
brother
of
Jared
,
and
chastened
him
because
he
remember
not
to
call
upon
the
name
of
the
Lord
.
And
the
brothe
of
Jared
repented
him
of
the
evil
which
he
had
done
,
and
dig
call
upon
the
name
of
the
Lord
for
his
brethern
which
wee
with
him
.
And
the
Lord
said
unto
him
,
I
will
forgive
the
and
thy
brethern
of
their
sins
;
but
thou
shalt
not
sin
any
mom
,
for
ye
shall
remember
that
my
spirit
will
not
always
with
man
;
wherefore
if
ye
will
sm
until
ye
are
fully
ripe
,
ye
shall
:
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
.
And
thisis
my
thoughts
upon
the
land
which
[
shall
give
you
for
youriheritance
;
for
it
shall
be
a
land
choice
above
all
other
tands
And
the
Lord
said
,
Go
to
work
and
build
,
after
the
manne
of
barges
which
ye
have
hitherto
built
.
And
it
came
to
pas
that
the
brother
of
Jared
did
go
to
work
,
and
also
his
bret
ren
,
and
built
barges
after
the
maner
which
they
had
bull
,
according
to
the
instructions
of
the
Lord
.
And
they
wee
small
,
and
they
were
light
upon
the
water
,
even
like
unto
tle
lightness
of
a
fowl
upon
the
water
;
and
they
were
built
aile
a
manner
that
they
were
exceeding
tight
,
even
that
they
woull
hold
water
Jike
unto
a
dish
;
and
the
bottom
thereof
was
tigtl
like
unto
a
dish
;
and
the
sides
thereof
was
tight
like
unto
dish
;
and
the
ends
thereof
were
peaked
;
and
the
top
theres
!
was
tight
like
unto
a
dish
;
and
the
length
thereof
was
tie
length
of
a
tree
;
and
the
door
thereof
,
when
it
was
shut
,
wis
tight
like
unto
adish
.
And
itcame
to
pass
that
the
brothera
Jared
cried
unto
the
Lord
,
saying
:
O
Lord
,
I
have
performel
the
work
which
thou
hast
commanded
me
,
and
I
have
male
the
barges
according
as
thou
hast
directed
me
.
And
bebolt
,
O
Lord
,
in
them
there
is
uo
light
,
whither
shall
we
steer
—
And
elso
we
shall
perish
,
for
in
them
we
cannot
breathe
,
sate
itis
the
air
which
is
in
them
;
therefore
we
shall
perish
.
And
the
Lord
said
unto
the
brother
of
Jared
,
Behold
,
thou
shal
make
a
hole
in
the
top
thereof
,
and
also
in
the
bottom
there0lj
and
when
thou
shalt
suffer
for
air
,
thou
shalt
unstop
the
hole
thereof
,
and
receive
air
,
And
if
it
so
be
that
the
water
come
in
upon
thee
,
behold
,
ye
shall
stop
the
hole
thereof
,
that
je
may
not
perish
in
the
flood
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
Jared
did
so
,
according
as
the
Lord
had
commanded
And
be
cried
again
unto
the
Lord
,
saying
,
O
Lord
,
behold
£
have
done
even
as
thou
hast
commanded
me
;
and
I
have
pre
[File:547]
red
the
vessels
for
my
people
,
and
bebold
,
there
is
no
light”
in
them
.
Behold
,
O
Lord
,
wilt
thou
suffer
that
we
shall
cross
{his
great
water
in
darkness
?
And
the
Lord
said
unto
the
brother
of
Jared
,
What
will
ye
that
I
should
do
that
ye
may
have
light
in
your
vessels
?
For
behold
,
ye
cannot
have
windows
,
for
they
will
be
dashed
in
pieces
;
neither
shall
ye
take
fire
with
you
,
for
ye
shall
not
go
by
the
light
of
fire
:
for
behold
,
ye
shall
be
as
a
whale
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
;
for
the
mountain
waves
shall
dash
upon
you
.
Nevertheless
,
I
will
bring
you
up
again
out
of
the
depths
of
the
sea
:
for
the
winds
have
gone
forth
out
of
my
mouth
,
and
also
the
rains
and
the
floods
have
1
sent
forth
.
And
behold
,
I
prepare
you
against
these
things
:
for
howbeit
,
ye
cannot
cross
this
great
deep
,
save
I
prepare
you
against
the
waves
of
the
sca
,
and
the
winds
which
have
gone
forth
,
and
the
floods
which
shall
come
,—
Therefore
what
will
ye
that
I
should
prepare
for
you
,
that
ye
way
have
light
when
ye
are
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
?
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
Jared
,
(
now
the
number
of
the
yessels
which
had
been
prepared
,
was
eight
,)
went
forth
unto
the
mount
,
which
they
called
the
mount
Shelem
,
because
of
its
exceeding
height
,
and
did
moulten
out
of
a
tock
sixteen
small
stones
;
and
they
were
white
ahd
clear
,
even
as
transparent
glass
;
and
he
did
carry
them
in
his
hands
won
the
top
of
the
mount
,
and
cried
again
unto
the
Lord
,
saying
,
O
Lord
,
thou
hast
said
that
we
must
be
encompassed
about
by
the
floods
,
Now
behcld
,
O
Lord
,
and
do
not
be
angry
with
thy
servant
because
of
his
weakness
before
thec
:
for
we
know
that
thou
art
holy
,
and
dwellest
in
the
heavens
,
aid
that
we
are
unworthy
before
thee
:
because
of
the
fall
,
our
natures
have
become
evil
continually
;
nevertheless
,
O
Lord
,
thou
hast
given
us
a
commandment
that
we
must
call
upon
thee
,
that
from
thee
we
may
receive
according
to
our
desires
,
Behold
,
O
Lord
,
thou
hast
smitten
us
because
of
our
iniquity
,
and
hath
driven
us
forth
,
and
for
this
many
years
we
have
been
in
the
wilderness
;
nevertheless
,
thou
hast
been
merciful
unto
us
.
O
Lord
,
look
upon
me
in
pity
,
and
turn
away
thine
anger
from
this
thy
people
,
and
suffer
not
that
they
shalt
go
forth
across
this
raging
deep
in
darkness
,
but
Uehold
these
things
which
]
have
moulten
out
of
the
rock
.—
And
I
know
,
O
Lord
,
that
thou
hast
all
power
,
and
can
do
Whatsoever
thou
wilt
for
the
henefit
of
man
;
therefore
touch
these
stones
,
O
Lord
,
with
thy
finger
,
and
prepare
them
that
[File:548]
they
may
shine
forth
i
darkness
;
and
they
shail
shine
fon
)
unto
us
in
the
vessels
which
we
have
prepared
,
that
we
may
have
light
while
we
shall
cross
the
sea
.
Behold
,
O
Lox
,
thou
canst
do
this
.
We
know
that
thouart
able
to
shew
for}
great
power
,
which
looks
small
unto
the
understanding
of
men
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
brother
of
Jared
had
said
these
words
,
behold
,
the
Lord
stretched
forth
his
band
and
touched
the
stones
,
one'
by
one
,
with
his
finger
;
an]
the
veil
was
taken
from
off
the
eyes
of
the
brother
of
Jared
,
and
he
saw
the
finger
of
the
Lord
;
and
it
was
as
the
fingerof
aman
,
like
unto
flesh
and
blood
;
and
the
brother
of
Jured
fell
down
before
the
Lord
,
for
he
was
struck
with
fear
.
And
the
Lord
saw
that
the
brother
of
Jared
had
fallen
to
the
earth
;
and
the
Lord
said
unto
him
,
Arise
,
why
hast
thou
fallen
?
And
he
saith
anto
the
Lord
,
1
saw
the
finger
of
the
Lord
,
and]
feared
lest
he
should
smite
me
:
tor
I
knew
not
that
the
Loni
had
flesh
and
blood
.
And
the
Lord
said
unte
him
,
Becauseal
thy
faith
thou
hast
scen
that
I
shall
take
upon
me
flesh
and
blood
;
and
never
has
man
come
before
me
with
such
excel
ing
faith
as
thou
hast
:
for
were
it
so
,
ye
could
not
have
seen
my
finger
.
Sawest
thou
more
than
this
?
And
he
ansvwered
,
Nay
,
Lord
,
shew
thyself
unio
me
.
And
the
Lord
said
unio
hin
,
Believest
thou
the
words
which
I
shall
speak
?
And
he
answered
,
Yea
,
Lord
,
I
know
that
thou
speakest
the
truth
,
for
thou
art
a
God
of
truth
,
and

And
whenhe
had
said
these
words
,
behold
,
the
Lord
shewed
himself
unio
him
,
and
said
,
Because
thou
knowest
these
things
,

I
Moroni
,
said
I
could
not
make
a
full
aceou
iia
[File:549]
i
of
these
things
which
are
written
,
therefore
it
sufficeth
me
to
say
,
That
Jesus
shewed
himself
unto
this
man
in
the
spirit
,
even
after
the
manner
and
in
the
likeness
of
the
same
body
,
even
as
he
shewed
himself
unto
the
Nephites
;
and
he
ministered
unto
him
,
cyen
as
be
ministered
unto
the
Nephites
:
and
all
this
,
that
this
man
knew
that
he
was
God
,
because
of
the
many
great
works
which
the
Lord
had
shewed
unto
him
.
And
because
of
the
knowledge
of
this
man
,
he
could
not
be
kept
trom
beholding
within
the
veil
:
.
and
he
saw
the
finger
of
Jesus
,
which
,
when
he
saw
,
he
fell
with
fear
:
for
he
knew
that
it
was
the
finger
of
the
Lord
;
and
he
had
faith
no
Jonger
,
for
he
knew
,
nothing
doubting
;
wherefore
,
having
this
perfect
knowledge
of
God
,
he
could
not
be
kept
from
within
the
veil
;
therefore
he
saw
Jesus
,
and
he
did
minister
unto
him
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
said
unto
the
brother
of
Jared
,
Behold
,
thou
shalt
not
suffer
these
things
which
ye
have
seen
and
heard
,
to
go
forth
unto
the
world
,
until
the
time
cometh
that
I
shall
glorify
my
name
in
the
flesh
;
wherefore
,
ye
shall
treasure
up
the
things
which
ye
have
seen
and
heard
,
and
shew
it
tono
man
.
And
behold
,
when
¥e
shall
come
unto
me
,
ye
shall
write
them
and
shall
seal
them
up
,
that
no
one
can
interpret
them
:
for
ye
shall
write
them
ina
language
that
they
cannot
be
read
.
And
behold
,
these
two
stones
will
I
give
unto
thee
,
and
ye
shall
seal
them
up
also
,
with
the
things
which
ye
shall
write
.
For
behold
,
the
language
which
ye
shall
write
,
I
haye
confounded
;
wherefore
I
will
cause
in
mine
own
due
time
that
these
stones
shall
magnify
to
the
eyes
of
men
,
these
things
which
ye
shall
write
.
And
when
the
Lord
had
said
these
words
,
the
Lord
shewed
unip
the
brother
of
Jared
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
which
had
been
,
and
also
all
that
would
be
;
and
the
Lord
withheld
them
not
from
his
:
ight
,
even
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
:
for
the
Lord
had
said
unto
him
in
times
before
,
that
if
he
would
believe
in
him
,
that
he
could
shew
unto
him
all
things
—
it
should
be
shewn
unto
him
;
therefore
the
Lord
could
not
withhold
any
thing
from
him
:
for
he
knew
that
the
Lord
could
shew
him
all
things
.
And
the
Lord
said
unto
him
,
Write
these
things
and
seal
them
up
,
and
Iwill
shew
them
in
mine
own
duc
time
unto
the
children
of
men
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
commanded
him
that'he
should
seal
,
up
the
two
stones
which
he
had
received
,
and
shew
them
not
,
until
the
Lord
should
shew
them
unto
the
children
of
men
,
And
the
Lord
commanded
the
brother
of
[File:550]
Jared
to
go
down
out
of
the
mount
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
,
and
write
the
things
-
which
he
had
seen
:
and
they
were
forbidden
to
come
unto
the
children
of
men
,
until
after
that
he
should
be
lifted
up
upon
.
the
cross
:
and
for
this
cause
did
king
Benjamin
keep
them
,
that
they
should
not
come
unto
the
world
until
after
Christ
should
shew
himself
unto
his
people
.
And
after
that
Christ
truly
had
shewed
himself
unto
his
people
,
he
commanded
that
they
should
be
made
manifest
,
And
now
,
after
-
that
,
they
have
all
dwindled
in
unbelief
,
and
there
is
none
,
save
it
be
the
Lamanites
,
and
they
have
rejected
the
Gospel
of
Christ
;
therefore
am
commanded
that
I
should
hide
them
up
again
in
the
earth
.
Behold
,
I
have
written
upon
these
plates
the
very
things
,
which
the
brother
of
Jared
saw
;
and
there
never'wes
greater
things
made
manifest
,
than
that
which
was
made
manifest
unto
the
brother
of
Jared
;
wherefore
,
the
Lord
hath
commanded
me
to
write
them
;
and
have
wrote
them
.
And
he
commanded
me
that
I
should
scal
them
up
;
and
he
also
hath
commanded
that
I
should
seal
up
the
interpretation
thereof
;
wherefore
I
have
sealed
up
the
interpreters
,
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
Lord
.
For
the
Lord
saith
unto
me
,
They
shall
not
go
forth
unto
the
Gentiles
until
the
day
that
they
shall
repent
of
their
iniqutity
,
and
be
come
clean
before
the
Lord
;
and
in
that
day
that
they
shall
exercise
faith
in
me
,
saith
the
Lord
,
even
as
the
brother
of
Jared
did
,
that
they
may
become
sanctified
in
me
,
then
will
manifest
unto
them
the
things
which
the
brother
of
Jared
saw
,
even
to
the
unfolding
unto
them
all
my
revelations
,
saith
Je

Father

And
he
that
wil

word
of
the
Lord
,
let
him
be
accursed
;
and
he
that
shall
deny
these
things
,
let
him

for

speaketh
;
and
at
my
command
the
heavens
are
opened
and
are
shut
;
and
at
my
word
,
the
earth
shall
shake
;
and
at
my
command
,
the
inhabitants
thereof
shal

pass
away
,
even
so
as
by
fire
;
and
he
that
believeth
not

words
,

disciples
;
and
ifit
so
be
that
I
do
not
speak
,
judge
ye
:
for
ye
shall
know
that
itis
I
that
speaketh
,
at
the
last
day
.
But
he
that
believeth
these
things
which
I
have
spoken
,
him
will
I
visit
with
the
manifestations
of
my
spit

Behold

when

which
doth

you
to
remain
in
your
awful
state
of
wickedness

then
shall
the
great

marvellous
things

have
been
hid
up
from

from
you

when
ye
shall
call
upon

Father
in

with
a
broken
heart

contrite
Spirit

then
shall
ye
know
that
the
Father
hath
remembered
the
coveuant

he
made

and
then
shall
my
revelations

was

CHAPTER
III
.
Anp
now
I
,
Moroni
,
proceed
to
give
the
record
of
Jared
and
his
brother
.
For
it
came
to
pass
after
that
the
Lord
had
prepared
the
stones
which
the
brother
of
Jared
had
carried
up
into
the
mount
,
the
brother
of
Jared
came
down
out
of
the
mount
,
and
he
did
put
forth
the
stones
into
the
vessels
which
were
prepared
,
one
in
each
end
thereof
;
and
behold
,
they
did”
give
light
unto
the
vessels
thereof
.
And
thus
the
Lord
cau
:
sed
stones
to
shine
in
darkness
,
to
give
light
unto
men
,
women
and
children
,
that
they
might
not
cross
the
great
waters
2
darkness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
prepared
all
manner
of
food
,
that
thereby
they
might
subsist
upon
the
water
,
and
also
food
for
their
flocks
and
herds
,
and
whatsoever
beast
,
or
animal
,
or
fowl
that
they
should
carry
with
them
:
Andit
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
done
all
these
things
,
they
got
aboard
of
their
vessels
or
barges
,
and
set
forth
into
the
sea
,
commending
themselves
unto
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
God
caused
that
there
should
2
furious
wind
blow
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
,
towards
the
,
promised
land
;
and
thus
they
were
tossed
upon
the
waves
al
the
sea
before
the
wind
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
,
many
times
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
,
because
of
the
mountain
waves
which
broke
upon
them
,
and
also
the
grea
!
[File:553]
and
terrible
tempests
which
were
caused
by
the
fierceness
of
the
wind
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
were
buried
in
the
deep
,
there
was
no
water
that
could
hurt
them
,
their
vessels
being
tight
like
unto
a
dish
,
and
also
they
were
tight
like
unto
the
ark
of
Noah
;
therefore
when
they
were
encompassed
about
by
many
waters
,
they
did
cry
unto
the
Lord
,
and
he
did
bring
them
forth
again
upon
the
top
of
the
waters
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
wind
did
never
cease
to
blow
towards
the
promised
Jand
,
while
they
were
upon
the
waters
;
and
thus
they
were
driven
forth
belore
the
wind
;
and
they
did
sing
praises
unto
the
Lord
;
yca
,
the
brother
of
Jared
did
sing
praises
unto
the
Lord
,
and
he
did
thank
and
praise
the
Lord
all
the
day
long
;
and
when
the
night
came
,
they
did
not
cease
to
praise
the
Lord
,
And
thus
they
were
driven
forth
;
and
no
monster
of
the
sea
could
break
them
,
neither
whale
that
could
mar
them
:
and
they
did
have
hight
continually
,
whether
it
was
above
the
water
or
under
the
water
.
And
thus
they
were
driven
forth
,
three
hundred
and
forty
and
four
days
upon
the
water
;
and
they
did
land
upon
the
shore
of
the
promised
land
.
And
when
they
had
set
their
feet
upon
the
shores
of
the
promised
land
,
they
bowed
themselves
down
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
did
humble
themselves
before
the
Lord
,
and
did
zhed
tears
of
joy
before
the
Lord
,
because
of
the
multitude
of
his
tender
mercies
over
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
began
to
til
the
earth
.
And
Jared
had
four
sons
;
anit
they
were
called
Jacom
,
and
Gilgah
,
and
Mahah
,
and
Orihah
.
And
the
brother
of
Jared
also
begat
sons
and
daughters
.
And
the
friends
of
Jared
and
his
brother
,
were
in
number
about
twenty
and
two
souls
;
and
they
also
hegat
sons
and
daughters
,
before
they
came
to
the
promised
land
;
and
therefore
they
began
to
be
many
.
And
they
were
taught
to
walk
humbly
before
the
Lord
;
and
they
were
also
taught
from
on
high
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
spread
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
to
multiply
and
to
till
the
earth
;
and
they
did
wax
strong
in
the
land
,
And
the
brother
of
Jared
began
to
be
old
,
and
saw
that
he
must
soon
go
down
to
the
grave
;
wherefore
he
saith
unto
Jared
,
Let
us
gather
together
our
people
,
that
we
may
number
them
,
that
we
may
know
of
them
-
what
they
will
desire
of
us
before
we
go
down
to
our
graves
.
And
accordingly
the
people
were
gathered
together
.
Now
the
[File:554]
number
of
the
song
and
the
daughters
of
the
brother
of
Jared
were
twenty
and
two
souls
;
and
the
number
of
the
sons
and
daughters
of
Jared
were
twelve
,
he
having
four
sons
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
number
their
people
;
and
after
that
.
they
had
.
numbered
them
,
they
did
desire
of
them
the
things
which
they
would
that
they
should
do
before
they
went
down
to
their
graves
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
desired
of
them
that
they
should_anoint
one
of
their
sons
to
be
a
king
over
them
..
And
now
behold
,
this
was
grievous
unto
them
.—
But
the
brother
of
Jared
said
unto
them
,
Surely
,
this
thing
leadeth
into
captivity
.
But
Jared
said
unto
his
brother
,
Suf
fer
them
that
they
may
have
a
king
;
and
therefore
he
said
unto
them
,
Choose
ye
out
from
among
our
sons
a
king
,
even
whom
ye
will
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
chose
even
the
first
born
of
the
brother
of
Jared
;
and
.
his
name
was
Pagag
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
refused
and
would
not
be
their
king
.
And
the
people
would
that
his
father
should
constrain
him
;
but
his
fae
ther
would
not
;
and
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
constrain
no
man
to
be
their
king
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
chose
all
the
brothers
of
Pagag
,
and
they
would
not
—
And
it
came
to
pass
that
neither
would
the
sons
of
Jared
,
even
all
,
save
it
were
one
;
and
Orihah
,
he
was
anointed
to
be
king
over
the
people
.
And
he
began
to
reign
,
and
the
people
began
to
prosper
;
and
they
became
exceeding
rich
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Jared
died
,
and
his
brother
also
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Orihah
did
walk
humbly
before
the
Lord
,
cand
did
remember
how
great
things
the
Lord
had
done
for
his
father
,
and
also
taught
his
people
how
great
things
the
Lord
had
done
for
their
fathers
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Orihah
did
execute
judgement
upon
the
land
in
righteousness
all
his
days
,
whose
days
were
ex
ceeding
many
.
And
he
begat
sons
and
daughters
;
yea
,
he
begat
thirty
and
one
,
among
whom
were
twenty
and
three
sons
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
also
begat
Kib
in
his
old
age
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Kib
reigned
in
his
stead
;
and
Kib
begat
Corihor
.
And
when
Corihor
was
thirty
and
two
years
ald
,
he
rebelled
against
his
father
,
and
went
over
and
dwelt
in
the
land
of
Nehor
;
and
he
begat
sons
and
daughters
;
and
they
became
exceeding
fair
;
wherefore
Corihor
drew
away
many
people
after
him
,
And
when
he
had
gathered
together
an
army
,
he
came
up
unto
the
land
of
Moron
where
the
king
dwelt
,
and
took
him
captive
,
which
brought
to
pass
the
say
[File:555]
ing
of
the
brother
of
Jared
,
That
they
would
be
brought
into
captivity
.
Now
the
land
of
Moron
where
the
king
dwelt
,
was
near
the
land
which
is
called
Desolation
by
the
Nephites
.—
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Kib
dwelt
in
captivity
,
and
his
people
,
under
Corihor
his
son
,
until
he
became
exceeding
old
;
nevertheless
Kib
begat
Shule
in
his
old
age
,
while
he
was
yet
in
captivity
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Shule
was
angry
with
his
brother
;
and
Shule
waxed
strong
,
and
became
mighty
,
as
to
the
strength
ofa
man
;
and
he
was
also
mighty
in
judgement
.
Wherefore
he
came
to
the
hill
Ephraim
,
and
he
did
moulten
out
of
the
hill
,
and
made
swords
out
of
steel
for
those
which
he
had
drew
away
with
him
;
and
after
that
he
had
armed
them
with
swords
,
he
returned
to
the
city
Nehor
and
gave
battle
unto
his
brother
Corihor
,
by
which
means
he
obtained
the
kingdom
,
and
restored
it
unto
his
father
Kib
.
And
now
because
of
the
thing
which
Shule
had
done
,
his
father
bestowed
upon
him
the
kingdom
;
therefore
he
began
to
reign
in
the
stead
of
his
father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
-
did
execute
judgement
in
righteousness
;
and
he
did
spread
his
kingdom
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
for
the
people
had
become
exceeding
numerous
.—
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Shule
also
begat
many
sons
and
daughters
.
And
Corihor
repented
of
the
many
evils
which
he
had
done
;
wherefore
Shule
gave
him
power
in
his
kingdom
.
And
,
it
came
to
pass
that
Corihor
had
many
sons
and
daughters
.—
And
among
the
sons
of
Corihor
,
there
was
one
whose
name
was
Noah
.
_
#
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Noah
rebelled
against
Shule
,
the
king
,
and
also
his
father
Corihor
,
and
drew
.
away
Cohor
his
brother
,
and
also
all
his
brethren
and
many
of
the
people
.—
And
he
gave
battle
unto
Shule
,
the
king
,
in
the
which
he
did
obtain
the
land
of
their
first
inheritance
;
and
he
became
a
king
over
that
part
of
the
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
gave
battle
again
unto
Shule
the
king
;
and
he
tock
Shule
the
king
,
and
carried
him
away
captive
into
Moron
.
And
it
,
came
to
pass
as
he
was'
about
to
put
him
to
death
,
the
sons
of
Sh
crept
into
the
house
of
Noab
by
night
and
slew
him
,
and
b
:
down
the
door
of
the
prison
and
brought
out
their
father
,
an
placed
him
upon
his
throne
in
his
own
kingdom
;
wherefore
the
son
of
Nowxh
did
build
up
bis
kingdom
in
his
stead
;
nevertheless
they
did
not
gain
power
any
more
over
Shule
the
king
;
and
the
people
which
were
under
the
reign
of
Shule
the
king
,
did
prosper
exceedingly
and
wax
great
.
And
the
[File:556]
country
was
divided
;
and
there
was
two
kingdoms
,
the
king
dom
of
Shule
,
and
the
kingdom
of
Color
,
the
son
of
Noah
.
And
Cohor
,
the
son
of
Noah
,
caused
that
his
people
should
give
batile
unto
Shule
,
in
the
which
Shule
did
beat
them
,
and
did
slay
Cohor
.
And
now
Cohor
had
a
son
which
was
called
Nimrod
;
and
Nimrod
gave
up
the
kingdom
of
Cohor
unio
Shule
,
and
he
did
gain
favor
in
the
eyes
of
Shule
;
wherefore
Shule
did
bestow
great
favors
upon
him
,
in
the
which
he
did
do
in
the
kingdom
of
Shule
according
to
his
desires
;
and
also
in
the
reign
of
Shule
there
came
prophets
among
the
people
,
which
were
sent
from
the
Lord
,
prophesying
that
the
wicked
ness
and
idolatry
of
the
people
was
bringing
a
curse
upon
the
Jand
,
in
the
which
they
should
be
destroyed
,
if
they
did
not
repent
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
did
revile
against
the
prophets
,
and
did
mock
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Shule
did
execute
judgement
against
all
those
who
did
revile
against
the
prophets
;
and
he
did
execute
a
law
throughout
al
!
the
land
,
which
gave
power
unto
the
prophets
that
they
should
go
whithersoever
they
would
;
and
hy
this
cause
the
people
were
brought
unto
repentance
.
And
because
the
people
did
repent
of
their
iniquities
and
idolatries
,
the
Lord
did
spare
them
,
and
they
began
to
prosper
again
in
the
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Shule
begat
sons
and
daughters
in
his
old
age
.
.
And
there
was
no
more
wars
in
the
days
of
Shule
;
and
he
remembered
the
great
things
that
(
he
Lord
had
done
for
his
fathers
in
bringing
them
across
the
great
deep
into
the
promised
Jand
;
wherefore
he
did
execute
judgement
in
righteousness_all
his
days
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
begat
Omer
,
and
Omer
reigned
in
his
stead
.
And
Omer
begat
Jared
;
and
Jared
begat
sous
and
daughters
.
And
Jared
rebelled
against
his
father
,
and
came
and
dwelt
in
the
land
of
Heth
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
flatter
much
people
,
because
of
his
cunning
words
,
'
until
he
had
gained
the
half
of
the
kingdom
.
And
when
be
had
gained
the
half
of
the
kingdom
,
he
gave
battle
unto
his
father
,
and
he
did
carry
away
his
father
into
captivity
,
and
did
make
them
serve
in
captivity
.
And
now
in
the
days
of
the
reign
of
Omer
,
he
was
in
captivity
the
half
of
his
days
.
And
it
camg
to
pass
that
he
begat
sons
and
daughters
,
among
whom
were
Esrom
and
Coriantumr
;
and
they
were
excceding
angry
because
of
the
doings
of
Jared
their
brother
,
insomuch
that
they
did
raise
an
army
,
and
gave
battle
unto
Jared
.
And
if
[File:557]
came
to
pass
that
they
did
give
battle
unto
him
by
night
.—
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
slew
the
army
of
Jared
,
they
were
about
to
slay
him
also
;
and
he
plead
with
them
that
they
would
not
slay
him
,
and
he
would
give
up
the
kingdom
unto
his
father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
grant
uato
him
his
life
,
And
now
Jared
became
exceeding
sorrowful
because
of
the
loss
of
the
kingdom
,
for
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
the
kingdom
,
and
upon
the
glory
of
the
world
,
Now
the
daughter
of
Jared
being
exceeding
expert
,
and
seeing
the
sorrows
of
her
father
,
thought
to
devise
a
plan
whereby
she
could
redeem
the
kingdom
unto
her
father
.
Now
the
daughter
of
Jared
was
exceeding
fair
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
she
did
talk
with
her
father
,
and
saith
unto
him
,
Whereby
hath
my
father
so
much
sorrow
?
Hath
he
not
read
the
record
which
our
fathers
brought
across
the
great
deep
?
Behold
,
is
there
not
an
account
concerning
them
of
old
,
that
they
by
their
secret
plans
did
obtain
kingdoms
and
great
glory
?
And
now
therefore
,
let
my
father
send
for
Akish
,
the
son
of
Kimnor
;
and
behold
,
Yam
fair
,
and
I
will
dance
before
him
,
and
I
will
please
him
,
that
he
will
desire
me
to
wife
;
whercfore
if
he
shall
desire
of
thec
that
ye
shall
give
unto
him
me
to
wife
,
then
shall
ye
say
,
I
will
give
her
if
ye
will
bring
unto
me
the
head
of
my
father
,
the
king
.
And
now
Omer
was
a
friend
to
Altish
,
wherefore
when
Jared
had
sent
for
Akish
,
the
daughtr
of
Jared
danced
before
him
,
that
she
pleased
him
,
insomuch
that
he
desired
her
to
wife
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
le
said
unto
Jared
,
Give
her
unto
me
to
wife
.
And
Jared
suid
unto
him
,
I
will
give
her
unto
you
,
if
ye
will
bring
unto
me
the
head
of
my
father
,
the
king
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Akish
gathered
in
unto
the
house
of
Jared
all
his
kinsfolks
,
aud
saith
unto
them
,
Will
ye
swear
unto
me
that
ve
will
be
faithful
unto
me
in
the
thing
which
I
shall
desire
of
you
?
And
iicame
to
pass
that
they
all
sware
unto
him
,
by
the
God
of
Heaven
,
and
also
by
the
Heavens
,
and
also
by
the
carth
,
and
by
their
heads
,
that
whoso
should
vary
from
the
assistance
which
Akish
desired
,
should
lose
his
head
;
and
whoso
should
divulge
whatsoever
thing
Akish
made
Inown
unto
them
,
the
same
should
lose
his
life
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
they
did
agree
with
Akish
.
And
Akish
did
administer
unto
them
the
oaths
which
was
given
by
them
of
old
,
who
also
sought
power
,
which
had
been
handed
down
even
from
Cain
,
who
Was
a
murderer
from
the
beginning
.
And
they
were
kepi
up
ty
the
power
of
the
devil
to
administer
these
oaihs
unto
the
[File:558]
people
,
to
keep
them
in
darkness
,
tohelp
such
as
sought
poy
.
er
,
to
gain
power
,
and
to
murder
,
and
to
plunder
,
and
to
jj
and
to
commit
all
manner
of
wickedness
and
shoredoms
.—
And
it
was
the
daughter
of
Jared
which
put
it
into
-
his
hear
to
search
up
these
things
of
old
;
and
Jared
put
it
into
the
heart
of
Akish
;
wherefore
Akish
administered
it
unto
his
kin
dreds
and
friends
,
leading
them
away
by
fair
promises
to
dp
whatsoever
thing
he
desired
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
formed
a
secret
combination
,
even
as
they
of
old
;
which
com
bination
is
a
most
abominable
and
wicked
above
all
,
in
the
sight
of
God
:
for
the

CHAPTER
IV
.
Anp
now
I
,
Moroni
,
proceed
with
my
record
,
Therefore
beboli
,
it
came
to
pass
that
because
of
the
secret
combinations
of
Akish
and
his
friends
,
behold
they
did
overthrow
the
kingdom
of
Omer
;
nevertheless
,
the
Lord
was
merciful
unto
Omer
,
and
also
to
his
sons
and
to
his
daughters
,
which
were
not
,
or
which
didnot
seek
his
destruction
,
And
the
Lord
warned
Omer
in
adream
,
that
he
should
depart
out
of
the
land
;
wherefore
Omer
departed
out
of
the
land
with
his
family
,
and
travelled
imany
days
,
and
came
over
and
passed
hy
the
hill
of
Shim
,
and
came
over
by
the
place
where
the
Nephites
were
destroyef
,
and
from
thence
castward
,
and
came
to
a
place
which
was
talled
Ablom
,
by
the
seashore
,
and
there
he
pitched
his
tent
,
aid
also
his
sons
and
his
daughters
,
and
all
his
household
,
fave
it
were
Jared
and
his
family
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Jared
was
anointed
king
over
the
ae
by
ihe
hand
of
wickedness
;
and
he
gave
unto
Akish
is
daughter
to
wife
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alkish
sought
—
the
life
of
his
father
-
in
-
law
;
and
he
applied
unto
those
whom
he
had
sworn
by
the
oath
of
the
ancients
,
and
they
obtained
the
head
of
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
as
he
sat
apon
his
throne
,
giving
audience
to
his
people
:
for
so
great
had
been
the
spreading
of
this
wicked
and
secret
society
,
that
it
had
corrupted
the
hearts
of
all
the
people
;
therefore
Jared
was
.
murdered
upon
his
throne
,
and
Akish
reigned
in
his
stead
.
And
it
eame
to
pass
that
Akish
began
to
be
jealous
of
his
son
,
therefore
he
shut
him
up
in
prison
,
and
kept
him
upon
a
little
or
no
food
,
until
hehad
suffered
death
.
And
now
the
brother
of
him
that
suf
fered
death
,
(
and
his
name
was
Nimrah
,)
was
angry
with
his
father
,
because
of
that
which
his
father
had
done
unto
his
b

ther
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nimrah
gathered
togeth
[File:560]
small
number
of
men
,
and
fled
out
of
the
land
,
and
came
ove
and
dwelt
with
Omer
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Akish
begy
other
sons
,
and
they
won
the
hearts
of
the
people
,
notwiih
.
standing
they
had
sworn
unto
him
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
,
according
to
that
which
he
desired
.
Now
the
people
of
Alid
.
were
desirous
for
gain
,
even
as
Akish
was
desirous
for
poy

er
;
wherefore
the
sons
of
Akish
did
offer
them
money
,
by
the
which
means
they
drew
away
the
more
part
of
the
people
a
ter
them
;
and
there
began
to
be
a
war
between
the
sons
of
Akish
and
Akish
,
which
lasted
for
the
space
of
many
years
;
yea
,
unto
the
destruction
of
nearly
all
the
people
of
the
kin

dom
;
yea
,
even
all
,
save
it
were
thirty
souls
,
and
they
whiel
fled
with
the
house
of
Oiner
;
wherefore
Omer
was
restored
again
to
the
land
of
his
inheritance
.
And
it
came
to
pass
thal
Omer
began
to
be
old
;
nevertheless
,
in
his
old
age

;
and
he
anointed
Emer
to

And
after
that
he
had
anointed
Emer
to
be
king
,
he
saw
peace
in
the
land
for
the
space
of
two
years
,
and
he
died
,
haying
seet
exceeding
many
days
,
which
were
full
of
sorrow
.
Andi
came
to
pass
that
Emer
did
reign
in
his
stead
,
and
did
fill
the
steps
of
his
father
.
And
the
Lord
began
again
to
take
the
curse
froin
off
the
land
,
and
the
house
of
Emer
did
prospe
exceedingly
under
the
reign
of
Emer
;
and
in
the
space
ofsit
ty
and
two
years
,
they
had
become
exceeding
strong
,
ins
much
that
they
became
exceeding
rich
,
having

,
which
were
ue

the
food
of

and
they
also

and

and
there
were
elephants
,
and

,
and

;
allil
which
were
useful
unto
man
,
and
more
especially
the
de
phants
,
and
cureloms
,
and
cumoms
.
And
thus
the
Lord
did
pour
out
his
blessings
opon
this
land
,
which
was
choice
abort
all
other
lands
;
and
be
commanded
that
whoso
should
poss
the
land
,
should
possess
it
unto
the
Lord
,
or
they
sbould
bt
destroyed
when
they
were
ripened
in
iniquity
;
for
upon
such
,
saith
the
Lord
,
I
will
pour
out
the
fulness
of
my
wrath
.
And
Emer
did
execute
judgement
in

,

and
he
begat
many
sons
and
daughters
;
and
he
begat
Comil

tum
;
and
he
anointed
Coriantum
to
reign
in
his
stead
.
after
that
he
had
anointed
Coriantum
to
reign
in
his
steal
,
he
Kived
four
years
,
and
he
saw
peaee
in
the
land
;
yea
,
and
ii
[File:561]
even
saw
the
son
of
righteousness
,
and
did
rejoice
and
glory
in
his
day
;
and
he
died
in
peace
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Coiauntum
did
walk
in
the
steps
of
his
father
,
and
did
build
maay
mighty
cities
,
and
did
administer
that
which
was
good
unto
his
people
,
in
all
his
days
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
had
no
children
,
even
until
he
was
exceeding
old
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
his
wife
died
,
being
an
hundred
and
two
years
old
.
Andit
came
to

that
Coriantum

in
his
old
age
,

young
maid
,
and

wherefore

And

that
he

and
he
reigned

and
nine
years
,
and
he
begat

;
and
he
also
begat
other
sons
and
daughters
,
And
the
people
had
spread
again
over
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
there
hegan
again
to
be
an
exceeding
great
wickedness
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
Heth
began
to
embrace
the
seerct
plans
again
of
old
,
to
destroy
his
father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
dethrone
his
father
:
for
he
slew
him
with
his
own
sword
;
and
he
did
reign
in
his
stead
.
And
there
came
prophets
in
the
land
again
,
crying
repentance
unto
them
;
that
they
must
prepare
the
way
of
the
Lord
,
or
there
should
come
acurse
-
upon
the
face
of
the
land
;
yea
,
even
there
should
be
agreat
famine
,
in
the
which
they
should
be
destroyed
,
if
they
did
not
repent
.
But
the
people
believed
not
the
words
of
the
pophets
,
but
(
hey
cast
them
out
;
and
some
of
them
they
cast
info
pits
,
and
left
them
to
perish
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
done
all
these
things
according
to
the
commandment
of
tbeking
Heth
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
began
to
be
a
steat
dearth
upon
the
land
,
and
the
inhabitants
began
to
be
destroyed
exceeding
fast
,
because
of
the
dearth
:
for
there
was
no
rain
upon
the
face
of
the
carth
;
and
there
came
forth
poi
sonous
serpents
also
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
did
poison
many
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
their
flocks
began
to
flee
before
the
poisonous
serpents
,
towards
the
land
southward
,
which
was
called
by
the
Nephites
,
Zarahemla
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
of
them
which
did
perish
by
the
way
;
nevertheless
,
there
were
some
which
fled
into
the
land
southward
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
tause
the
serpents
that
they
should
pursue
them
no
more
,
tut
that
they
should
hedge
up
the
way
,
that
the
people
could
Rot
pass
;
that
whoso
should
attempt
to
pass
,
might
fall
by
fid
follow
the
course
of
the
beasts
,
and
did
devour
the
car
the
poisonous
serpents
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
.
[File:562]
casses
of
them
which
fell
by
the
way
,
until
they
had
devoured
them
all
.
Now
when
the
people
saw
that
they
must
perish
they
began
to
-
repent
of
their
iniquities
,
and
cry
unto
the
Lord
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
humbled
themselves
sufficiently
before
the
Lord
,
the
Lord
did
send
rain
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
,
and
the
people
began
to
revive
again
,
and
there
began
to
be
fruitin
the
north
countries
,
and
in
all
the
countries
round
about
.
And
the
Lord
did
shew
forth
his
power
unto
them
,
in
preserving
them
from
famine
.
Andit
came
to
pars
that
Shez
,
hich
was
a
descendant
of
Heth
,
for
Heth
had
perished
by
the
famine
,
and
all
bis
househoid
,
saveit
were
Shez
;
wherefore
Shez
hegan
to
build
up
again
a
broke
people
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Shez
did
remember
the
destruction
of
his
fathers
,
and
he
did
build
up
a
righteous
king
dom
,
for
he
remembered
what
the
Lord
had
done
in
bringing
Jared
and
his
brother
across
the
deep
;
and'
he
did
walk
in
the
ways
of
the
Lord
,
and
he
begat
sons
and
daughters
.
Ani
his
eldest
son
,
whose
name
was
Shez
,
did
rebel
against
him
;
nevertheless
,
Shez
was
smitten
by
the
hand
of
a
robber
,
he
cause
of
his
cxeeeding
riches
,
which
brought
peace
agan
unto
his
father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
his
father
did
bul

up
many
cities
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
the
people
began
again
to
spread
over
all
the
face
of
the
land
.
And
Shezdi
live
to
an
exceeding
old
age
;
and
he
begat
Riplakish
,
and
he
died
.
And
Riplakish
reigned
in
his
stead
.
And
it
cameto
pass
that
Riplakish
did
not
do
that
which
was
right
inthe
sight
of
tle
Lord
,
for
he
did
have
many
wives
and
coneubinss
,
and
did
lay
that
upon
men's
shoulders
which
was
gricvons
to
be
borne
;
yea
,
he
did
tax
them
with
heavy
taxes
;
and
with
the
taxes
he
did
build
many
spacious
buildings
.
And
he
did
erect
him
an
exceeding
beautiful
throne
,
and
be
did
build
me
ny
prisons
,
and
whoso
would
not
be
subject
unto
taxes
,
he
did
cast
into
prison
;
and
whoso
were
not
able
to
pay
taxes
,
he
did
cast
into
prison
;
and
he
did
cause
that
they
should
lator
continually
for
their
support
;
and
whoso
refused
to
labor
,
he
did
cause
to
be
put
to
death
;
wherefore
he
did
obtain
ali
his
fine
work
;
yea
,
even
his
fine
gold
he
did
cause
to
be
refined
in
prison
,
and
all
manner
of
fine
workmanship
he
did
canst
be'wrought
in
prison
.
And
it
came
fo
pass
that
he
did
afl
the
people
with
his
whoredoms
and
abominations
;
and
when
he
had
reigned
for
the
space
of
forty
and
two
years
,
the
pe
ple
did
raise
up
in
rebellion
against

,
and
there

again
in
the
land
,
insorhuch
that
Riplakish
was
killed
,
~
and
his
descendants
were
driven
out
of

And
it
came
to

after

of
many
years

went
forth
and
gave

unto

;
and
he
gained

And
he
did
do
justice
unto

but
not

,
because
of
his
muny

;
wherefore
he
was
cut
off

And

that

[File:565]
the

to
be
robbers
in

and

plans
,
and
administered
oaths
after
the
manner
of
the
ancients
,
and
sought
again
to

dom
.
Now
Com
did
fight
against
them
much
;
nevertheless
,
he
did
not
prevail
against
them
.
And
there
came
also
in
the
days
of
Com
many
prophets
,
and
prophesied
of
the
destruction
of
that
great
people
,
except
they
should
repent
and
turn
unto
the
Lord
,
and
forsake
their
murders
and
wickedness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
prophets
were
rejected
by
the
people
,
and
they
fled
unto
Com
for
protection
,
for
the
people
sought
to
destroy
them
;
and
they
prophesied
unto
Com
many
things
:
and
he
was
blessed
in
all

And
he
lived

Shiblom

and
Shiblom
reigned
in

And
the
brother
of
Shiblem
rebelled
against
him
;
and
there
began
to
be
an
exceeding
great
war
in
all
the
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
Shiblom
did
cause
that
all
the
prophets
which
prophesied
of
the
destruction
of
the
people
,
should
be
put
to
death
;
and
there
was
great
calamity
inall
the
land
:
for
they
had
testified
that
a
great
curse
should
,
come
upon
the
land
,
and
also
upon
the
people
,
and
that
there
should
be
a
great
destruction
among
them
,
such
an
one
as
never
had
been
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
;
and
their
bones
should
become
as
heaps

of
earth
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
except
they
should
repent
of
their
wickedness
,
And
they
hearkened
not
unto
the
voice
of
the
Lord
;
because
of
their
wicked
combinations
;
wherefore
there
began
to
be
wars
and
contentions
in
al
)
the
land
,
and
also
many
famines
and
pestifences
,
insomuch
that
there
was
a
great
destruction
,
such
an
one
as
never
had
been
known
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
:
and
all
this
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
Shiblom
.
And
the
people
began
to
repent
of
their
iniquity
;
apd
inasmuch
as
they
did
,
the
Lord
did
have
mercy
on
them
.
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Shiblom
was
slain
,
and
Seth
was
brought
into
captivity
;
and
he
did
dweil
in
captivity
all
his
days
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Ahah
,
his
son
,
did/obtain
the
kingdom'
;
and
he
did
reign
over
the
people
all
his
days
.
And
he
did
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
in
his
days
,
in
the
which
he
did
cause
the
shedding
of
much
blood
;
and
few
were
his
days
.
And
Ethem
,
being
a
descendant
of
Ahab
,
did
obtain
the
Iringdom
;
and
he
also
did
do
that
which
was
wicked
in
his
days
,
And
it
,
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
Ethem
,
there
came
many
prophets
and
prophesied
again
unto
tae
people
;
yea
,
they
did

prophesy
that
the
Lord
would
utterly
destroy
them
from
of
the
face
of
the
earth
,
except
they
repented
of
their
iniquities
,
_And
it
came
to
pass

people
hardened
their
hearts

not

withdrew

And
it
came
to

that

he
begat
Moron

And
it
came

pass
that
Moron
did
reign
in
his
stead
;
and
Moron
did
do
that
which
was
wicked
before
the
Lord
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
arose
a
rebellion
among
the
people
,
because
of
that
secret
combination
which
was
built
up
to
get
power
and
gain
;
and
there
arose
a
mighty
man
among
them
in
iniquity
,
and
gave
battle
unto
Moron
,
in
the
which
-
he
did
overthrow
the
half
of

and
he
did
maintain
the
half
of

for
many
years

And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moron
did
overthrow
him
,
and
did
obtain
the
kingdom
again
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
arose
another
mighty
man
;
and
be
was
a
descendant
of
the
brother
of
Jared
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that

did
overthrow

CHAPTER
Y
.
Ann
it
came
to
pass
that
the
days
of
Either
was
in
the
days
of
Coriantumr
;
and
Coriantumr
was
king
over
all
the
land
.—
_
And
Ether
wes
a
prophet
of
the
Lord
;
wherefore
Ether
came
forth
in
the
days
of
Coriantumr
,
and
began
to
prophesy
uml
the
people
,
for
he
could
not
be
constrained
because
of
the
[File:567]
spirit
of
the
Lord
which
was
in
him
:
for
he
did
ery
from
the
morning
,
even
until
the
going
down
of
the
sun
,
exhorting
the
people
to
beheve
in
God
unto
repentance
,
lest
they
should
be
destroyed
,
saying
unto
them
,
That
by
faith
all
things
are
fulfilled
;
wherefore
,
whoso
believeth
in
God
,
might
with
surety
hope
for
a
better
world
,
yea
,
even
a
place
at
the
right
hand
of
God
,
which
hope
cometh
of
faith
,
maketh
an
anchor
to
the
souls
of
men
,
which
would
make
them
sure
and
steadfast
,
always
abounding
in
good
works
,
being
led
to
glorify
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Ether
did
prophesy
great
and
marvellous
things
unto
the
people
,
which
they
did
not
believe
,
because
they
saw
them
not
.
And
now
I
,
Moroni
,
would
speak
somewhat
concerning
these
things
:
I
would
shew
unto
the
world
that
faith
is
things
which
are
hoped
for
and
not
seen
;
wherefore
,
dispute
not
because
ye
see
not
,
for
ye
receive
no
witness
until
after
the
irial
of
your
faith
:
forit
was
by
faith
that
Christ
shewed
himself
unto
our
fathers
,
after
that
he
had
risen
from
the
dead
;
and
he
shewed
not
himself
unto
them
,
until
after
they
had
faith
in
him
;
wherefore
it
must
-
needs
be
.
that
some
had
faith
in
him
,
for
he
shewed
himself
not
unto
the
world
.
But
because
of
the
faith
of
men
,
he
has
shewn
himself
unto
the
world
,
and
glorified
the
name
of
the
Father
,
and
prepared
a
way
that
thereby
others
might
be
partakers
of
the
heavenly
gift
,
that
they
might
hope
for
those
things
which
they
have
not
seen
;
wherefore
ye
may
also
have
hope
,
and
be
partakers
of
the
gift
,
if
ye
will
but
have
faith
.
Behold
,
it
was
by
faith
that
they
of
old
were
called
:
after
the
holy
order
of
God
;
wherefore
,
by
faith
,
was
the
law
of
Moses
given
.
But
inthe
gift
of
his
Son
,
hath
God
prepared
a
more
excellent
way
;
and
it
is
by
faith
that
it
hath
been
fulfilled
:
for
if
there
be
no
faith
among
the
children
of
men
,
God
can
do
no
miracle
among
them
;
wherefore
he
shewed
not
himself
until
after
their
faith
.
Behold
,
it
was
the
faith
of
Alma
and
Amulek
that
caused
the
prison
to
tumble
to
the
earth
.
Behold
,
it
was
the
faith
of
Nephi
and
Lehi
,
that
wrought
the
change
upon
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
were
baptized
with
fire
and
with
the
Holy
Ghost
.
Behold
,
it
was
the
faith
of
Ammon
and
his
brethren
,
Which
wrought
so
great
a
miracle
among
the
Lamanites
;
yea
,
and
cyen
all
they
which
wrought
miracles
,
wrought
them
by
faith
,
even
those
which
were
before
Christ
,
and
also
them
Which
were
after
.
And
it
was
by
faith
that
the
three
disciples
obtained
a
promise
that
they
should
not
taste
of
death
;
and
they
obtained
not
the
promise
until
after
their
faith
,
And
[File:568]
neither
at
any
time
hath
any
wrought
miracles
until
after
their
faith
;
wherefore
they
first
believed
in
the
Son
of
God
.
And
there'
were
many
whose
faith
was
so
excecding
strong
even
before
Christ
came
,
which
could
not
be
kept
from
within
the
veil
,
but
truly
saw
with
their
eyes
the
-
things
which
they
had
beheld
with
an
eye
of
faith
,
and
they
were
glad
.
And
behold
,
we
have
seen
in
this
record
,
that
one
of
these
was
the
brother
of
Jared
:
for
so
great
was
his
faith
in
God
,
that
when
God
put
forth
his
finger
,
he
could
not
hide
it
from
the
sight
of
the
brother
of
Jared
,
because
of
bis
word
which
he
had
spoken
unto
him
,
which
word
he
had
obtained
by
faith
.
And
after
that
the
brother
of
Jared
had
beheld
the
finger
of
the
Lord
,
because
of
the
promise
which
the
brother
of
Jared
had
obtain
.
ed
by
faith
,
the
Lord
could
not
withhold
any
thing
from
his
sight
;
wherefore
he
shewed
him
all
things
,
for
he
could
no
longer
be
kept
without
the
veil
.
And
it
is
by
faith
that
my
fathers
have
obtained
the
promise
that
these
things
should
come
unto
their
brethren
through
the
Gentiles
;
therefore
the
Lord
hath
commanded
me
,
yea
,
even
Jesus
Christ
.
And]
said
unto
him
,
Lord
,
the
Gentiles
will
mock
at
these
things
,
because
of
our
weakness
in
writing
:
for
Lord
,
thou
hast
made
us
mighty
in
word
by
faith
,
whereunto
thou
hast
not
madew
mighty
in
writing
:
for
thou
hast
made
all
this
people
that
they
could
speak
much
,
because
of
the
Holy
Ghost
which
thou
hast
given
them
;
and
thou
hast
made
us
that
we
could
write
but
little
,
because
of
the
awkwardness
of
our
bands
,
Behold
,
thou
hast
not
made
us
mighty
in
writing
like
unto
the
brother
of
Jared
,
for
thou
madest
him
that
the
things
which
he
wile
were
mighty
even
as
thou
art
,
unto
the
overpowering
of
mah
to
read
them
,
Thou
hast
also
made
our
words
powerful
and
great
,
even
that
we
cannot
write
them
;
wherefore
,
when
Wt
write
,
we
behold
our
weakness
,
and
stumble
because
of
the
_
placing
of
our
words
;
and
I
fear
lest
the
Gentiles
shall
mock
at
our
words
.
And
.
when
I
had
said
this
,
the
Lord
spake
ule
to
me
,
saying
,
Fools
mock
,
but
they
shall
mourn
;
and
ny
grace
is
sufficient
for
the
meck
,
that
they
shall
take
uo
advair
tage
of
your
weakness
:
and
if
men
come
unto
me
,
I
will
shew
unto
them
their
weakness
.
I
give
unto
men
wealmess
,

!
x
they
may
be
humble
;
and
my
grace
is
suificient
for
all
mn
that
humble
themselves
before
me
:
for
if
they
humble
the
selves
hefore
me
,
and
have
faith
in
me
,
then
will
I
make
@
things
become
strong
unto
them
.
Behold
,
I
will
shew

the
Gentiles
their
weakness
,
and
I
will

[File:569]
faith
,

,
and
charity

unto
me
the
fountain
of
all
righteousness
.
And}
,
Moroni
,
having
heard
these
words
,
was
comforted
,
and
said
,
O
Lord
,
thy
righteous
will
be
done
,
for
I
keow
that
thou
workest
unto
the
children
of
men
according
to
their
faith
:
for
the
brother
of
Jared
said
unto
the
mountain
Zixin
,
Remove
,
and
it
was
removed
.
And
if
he
had
not
had
faith
,
it
would
not
have
moved
;
wherefore
thou
workest
after
that
men
have
faith
:
for
{hus
did
thou
manifest
thyself
unto
thy
disciples
.
For
after
that
they
had
faith
,
and
did
speak
in
thy
name
,
thou
didst
shew
thysclf
unto
them
in
great
power
;
and
also
rememberest
that
thou
hast
said
that
thou
hast
prepared
a
house
for
man
;
yea
,
even
among
the
mansions
of
thy
Father
,
in
the
which
man
might
have
a
more
excellent
hope
;
wherefore
man
must
hope
,
or
he
cannot
receive
an
inheritance
in
the
place
which
thou
hast
prepared
.
And
again
I
remember
that
thou
hast
said
that
thou
hast
loved
the
world
,
even
unto
the
laying
down
of
thy
life
for
the
world
,
that
thou
mightest
take
it
again
to
prepare
a
place
for
the
children
of
men
,
And
now
I
know
that
this
love
which
thou
hast
had
_
for
the
children
of
men
,
is
charity
;
wherefore
,
except
men
shall
have
charity
,
they
cannot
inherit
that
place
which
thou
~
hast
prepared
in
the
mansions
of
thy
Father
.
Wherefore
,
I
know
by
this
thing
which
thou
hast
said
,
that
if
the
Gentiles
have
not
charity
,
because
of
our
weakness
,
that
thou
wilt
prove
them
,
and
take
away
their
talent
,
yea
,
even
that
which
they
have
received
,
and
give
unto
them
which
shall
haye
more
abundantly
.
i
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
prayed
unto
the
Lord
tha
would
give
unto
the
Gentiles
grace
,
that
they
might
have
charity
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
said
unto
me
,
If
they
haye
not
charity
,
it
mattereth
not
unto
thee
,
thou
hast
been
faithful
;
wherefore
thy
garments
shall
be
made
clean
.
And
because
thou
hast
seen
thy
weakness
,
thou
shalt
be
made
strong
,
even
unto
the
sitting
down
in
the
place
whieh
I
have
a
prepared
in
the
mansions
of
my
Father
.
And
now
I
,
Moroni
,
bid
farewell
unto
the
Gentiles
,
yea
,
and
also
unto
my
brethren
whom
I
love
,
until
we
shall
meet
before
the
judgement
seat
of
Christ
,
where
all
men
shall
know
that
my
garments
are
not
_
Spotted
with
your
blood
;
and
then
shall
ye
know
that
I
have
:
seen
Jesus
,
and
that
he
hath
talked
with
me
face
to
face
,
and
that
he
told
me
in
plain
humility
,
even
as
a
man
telleth
~
another
in
mine
own
language
,
concerning
these
things
;
and
only
a
few
have
I
written
,
because
of
my
weakness
in
writing
.
[File:570]
And
now
I
would
commend
you
to
Seek
this
Jesus
of
whon
the
prophets
and
apostles
have
written
,
that
the
Grace
of
God
the
Father
,
and
also
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
,
and
the

Ghost

may
be

CHAPTER
VI
.
Ano
now
J
,
Moroni
,
proceed
to
finish
my
record
concerning
the
destruction
of
the
people
of
which
I
nave
been
writing
—
For
behold
,
they
rejected
all
the
words
of
Ether
:
for
he
truly
told
them
of
all
things
,
trom
the
beginning
of
man
;
and
how
that
after
the
waters
had
receded
from
off
the
face
of'
this
land
,
it
became
a
choice
land
above
all
other
lands
,
a
chosen
land
of
the
Lord
;
wherefore
the
Lord
would
have
that
all
men
should
serve
him
,
which
dwelleth
upon
the
face
thereof
;
and
that
it
was
the
place
of
the
New
Jerusalem
,
which
should
come
down
out
of
Heaven
,
and
the
Holy
Sanctuary
of
the
Lord
.
Behold
,
Ether
saw
the
days
of
Christ
,
and
he
spake
concerning
a
New
Jerusalem
upon
this
land
;
and
he
spake
also
concerning
the
house
of
Israel
,
and
the
Jerusalem
fiom
whence
Lehi
shouid
come
;
after
that
it
should
be
destroyed
,
it
should
be
built
up
again
a
boly
city
unto
the
Lord
;
wherefore
it
could
not
be
a
New
Jerasalem
,
for
it
had
been
ina
fine
~
of
old
,
but
it
should
be
built
up
again
,
and
become
a
holy
city
of
the
Lord
;
and
it
should
be
built
up
unto
the
house
of
rael
;
and
that
a
New
Jerusalem
should
be
built
up
upon
this
land
,
unto
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
Joscph
,
for
the
which
things
there
has
been
a
type
:
for
as
Joseph
brought
his
father
,
down
into
the
land
of
Egypt
,
even
so
he
died
there
;
wherefore
the
Lord
brought
a
remnant
of
the
seed
,
of
Joseph
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
that
he
might
be
merciful
unto
the
seed
of
Joseph
,
that
they
should
perish
not
,
even
as
he
was
mereilill
unto
the
father
of
Joseph
,
that
he
should
perish
not
;
wher
fore
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
Joseph
shall
be
built
upon
this
land
;
and
it
shail
be
a
land
of
their
inheritance
;
and
they
shall
build
up
a
holy
city
unto
the
Lord
,
like
unto
the
Jerk
salem
of
old
;
and
they
shall
nc
more
be
confounded
,
until
the
:
end
come
,
when
the
earth
shall
pass
away
.
And
there
shall
be
a
new
heaven
anda
new
earth
;
and
they
shall
be
like
und
the
old
,
save
the
old
haye
passed
away
,
and
all
things
hare
[File:571]
become
new
.
And
ther'
cometh
the
New
Jerusalem
;
and
blessed
arc
they
which
dwell
therein
,
for
it
is
they
whose
garment
are
white
through
the
blood
of
the
Lamb
;
and
they
are
they
which
are
numbered
among
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
Joseph
,
which
were
of
the
house
of
Israel
.
And
then
also
cometh
the
Jerusalem
of
old
;
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
,
blessed
are
they
,
for
they
have
been
washed
in
the
blood
of
the
Lamb
;
and
they
are
they
which
were
scattered
and
gathered
in
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
,
and
from
the
north
countries
,
and
are
partakers
of
the
fulfilling
of
the
covenant
which
God
made
with
their
father
Abraham
.
And
when
these
things
come
,
bringeth
to
pass
the
Scripture
which
saith
,
There
are
they
which
were
first
,
which
shall
be
last
;
and
.
there
are
,
they
which
were
last
,
which
shall
be
first
.
And
[
was
about
to
write
more
,
but
I
am
forbidden
;
but
great
and
marvellous
were
the
prophecies
of
Ether
,
but
they
esteemed
him
as
nought
,
and
cast
him
out
,
and
he
hid
himself”
in
the
cavity
of
arock
by
day
,
and
by
night
he
went
forth
viewing
the
things
which
should
come
upon
the
people
.
And
as
he
dweit
in
the
cavity
of
a
rock
,
he
made
the
remainder
of
this
record
,
viewing
the
destructions
which
came
upon
the
peo
-
_
ple
by
night
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
that
same
year
which
he
was
cast
out
from
among
the
people
,
there
began
to
be
a
great
war
among
the
people
,
for
there
were
many
which
.
rose
up
who
were
mighty
men
,
and
sought
to
destroy
Corian
-
—
tumr
by
their
secret
plans
of
wickedness
,
of
which
hath
been
spoken
.
And
now
Coriantumr
,
having
studied
himself
imall
the
arts
of
war
,
and
all
the
cunning
of
the
world
,
wherefore
he
gave
battle
unto
them
which
sought
to
destroy
him
;
but
he
repented
not
,
neither
his
fair
sons
nor
daughters
;
neither
the
fair
sons
and
daughters
of
Cohor
;
neither
the
fair
sons
and
daughters
of
Corihor
;
and
in
fine
,
there
was
none
of
the
fair
sons
and
daughters
upon
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
,-
which
repented
of
their
sins
;
wherfore
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
first
year
that
Ether
dwelt
in
the
cavity
of
a
rock
,
there
was
many
people
which
was
slain
by
the
sword
of
those
secret
combinations
fighting
against
Coriantumr
,
that
they
might
obfain
the
kingdom
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
sons
of
Coriantumr
fought
much
,
and
bled
much
.
And
in
the
second
year
,
the
word
of
the
Lord
came
to
Ether
,
that
he
should
go
and
prophesy
unto
Coriantumr
,
that
if
he
would
repent
,
and
all
his
household
,
the
Lord
would
give
unto
him
his
kingdom
,
and
spare
the
people
,
otherwise
they
should
be
destroyed
,
and
al
[File:572]
his
household
,
save
it
were
himsclf
,
and
he
should
only
live
to
see
the
fulfilling
of
the
prophecies
which
had
heen
spoken
concerning
another
people
receiving
the
land
for
their
inheritance
;
and
Coriantumr
should
receive
a
burial
by
them
;
and
every
soul
should
be
destroyed
save
it
were
Coriantumr
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Coriantumr
repented
not
,
neither
his
household
,
neither
the
people
;
and
the
wars
did
cease
not
;
and
they
sought
to
kill
Ether
,
but
he
fled
from
before
them
,
and
hid
again
in
the
cavity
of
the
rock
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
arose
-
up
Shared
,
and
he
also
gave
battle
unto
Coriantumr
;
and
he
did
beat
him
,
insomuch
that
in
the
third
year
he
did
bring
him
into
captivity
.
And
the
sons
of
Coriantum
,
in
the
fourth
year
,
did
beat
Shared
,
and
did
obtain
the
kingdom
again
unto
their
father
.
Now
there
began
to
be
a
war
upon
.
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
every
man
with
his
band
,
fight
ing
for
that
which
he
desired
.
And
there
was
robbers
,
and
in
fine
,
all
manner
of
wickedness
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Coriantumr
was
excceding
angry
with
Shared
,
and
he
went
against
him
with
his
armies
,
to
battle
;
and
they
did
meet
in
great
anger
;
and
they
did
meet
in
the
valley
of
Gilgal
;
and
the
battle
became
exceeding
sore
—
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Shared
fought
against
him
for
the
space
of
three
days
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Coriantumr
beat
him
,
and
did
pursue
him
until
he
came
to
the
plains
of
Heshlon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Shared
gave
him
baltle
again
upon
the
plains
;
and
behold
,
he
did
beat
Coriantumr
,
and
drove
him
back
again
to
the
valley
of
Gilgal
.
And
Cor
antumr
gave
Shared
battle
again
in
the
valley
of
Gilgal
,
in
the
which
be
beat
Shared
,
and
slew
him
.
And
Shared
wounded
Coriantumr
,
in
his
thigh
,
that
he
did
not
go
to
battle
again
for
the
space
of
two
years
,
in
the
which
time
all
the
people
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
were
a
shedding
blood
,
and
there
was
none
to
constrain
them
.
And
now
there
began
.
to
be
a
great
curse
upon
the
land
,
because
of
the
iniqiuty
of
the
people
,
in
the
which
,
ifa'man
should
Jay
his
tool
or
his
sword
upon
the
shelf
,
or
upon
the
place
whither
he
would
keep
it
,
and
behold
,
upon
the
morrow
,
he
could
not
find
it
,
so
great
was
the
curst
upon
the
land
.
Wherefore
every
man
did
cleave
unto
thet
which
was
his
own
,
with
his
hands
,
and
would
not
borrow
,
neither
would
he
lend
;
and
every
man
kept
the
hilt
of
bis
sword
thereof
,
in
his
right
hand
,
in
the
defence
of
his
proper
ty
and
his
own
life
,
and
they
of
bis
wives
and
children
.

of
two
years

after
the
death
of

brother
of
Shared

he
gave
pattle
unto

the
which

did
pursue
him
to
the
wilderness
of
Akish
.
And
it
eame
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
Shared
did
give
battle
unto
him
in
the
wilderness
of
Akish
;
and
the
battle
became
exceedig
sore
,
and'many
thousands
fell
by
the
sword
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Coriantumr
did
lay
siege
to
the
wilderness
,
and
the
brother
of
Shared
did
march
forth
out
of
the
wilderness
by
night
,
and
slew
a
part
of
the
army
of
Coriantumr
,
as
they
were
drunker
.
And
he
came
forth
to
the
land
of
Moron
,
and
placed
himself
upon
the
throne
of
Coriantumr
.
And
it
came
(
o
pass
that
Coriantumr
dwelt
with
his
army
in
the
wilderness
,
for
the
space
of
two
years
,
in
the
which
he
did
receive
great
strength
to
his
army
.
Now
the
brother
of
Shared
,
whose
name
was
Gilead
,
also
received
great
strength
to
his
army
,
because
of
secret
combinations
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
his
High
Priest
murdered
him
as
he
sat
upon
his
throne
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
one
of
the
secret
combinations
murdered
him
in
a
secret
pass
,
and
obtained
urto
himself
the
kingdom
;
and
his
name
was
Lib
;
and
Lib
was
a
man
of
great
stature
,
more
than
any
other
man
among
all
the
people
.
And
itcame
to
pass
that
in
the
first
year
of
Lib
,
Coriantumr
came
up
unto
the
land
of
Moron
,
and
gave
battle
unto
Lib
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
fought
with
Lib
,
in
the
which
Lib
did
_
smite
upon
his
arm
,
that
he
was
wounded
;
nevertheless
,
the
army
of
Coriantumr
did
press
forward
upon
Lib
,
that
he
fled
to
the
borders
upon
the
seashore
.
And
it
came
to
pass
thet
Coriantumr
pursued
him
;
and
Lib
gave
battle
unto
bim
upon
the
seashore
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Lib
did
smite
the
army
of
Coriantumr
,
that
they
fied
again
to
the
wildernsss
of
Akish
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Lib
did
pursue
him
until
he
came
to
the
plains
of
Agosh
.
And
Coriantumr
had
taken
alt
the
people
with
him
,
as
he
fled
before
Lib
,
in
that
quarter
ol
the
land
whither
he
fled
.
And
when
he
had
come
to
the
porns
of
Agosh
,
he
gave
battle
unto
Lib
,
and
he
smote
upon
im
until
he
died
;
nevertheless
,
the
brother
of
Lib
did
come
against
Coriantumr
in
thestead
thereof
,
and
the
battle
became
exceeding
sore
,
in
the
which
Coriantumi
fled
again
before
the
army
of
the
brother
of
Lib
.
Now
the
name
of
the
brother
of
ib
was
called
Shiz
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Shiz
pursued
er
Coriantumr
,
and
he
did
overthrow
many
cities
,
and
e
did
slay
both
women
and
children
,
and
he
did
burn
the
cities
thereof'
;
and
there
went
a
fear
of
Shiz
throughout
all
the
[File:574]
Jand
;
yea
,
a
cry
went
forth
throughout
the
land
:
Who
ean
.
stand
before
the
army
of
Shiz
?
Behold
,
he
sweepeth
the
earth
before
him
!
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
began
to
flock
together
in
armies
,
throughout
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
And
they
were
divided
,
and
a
part
of
them
fled
to
the
army
of
Shiz
,
and
a
part
of
them
fled
to
the
army
of
Coriantumr
—
And
so
great
and
lasting
had
been
the
war
,
and
so
long
had
been
the
scene
of
bloodshed
and
carnage
,
that
the
whole
face
of
the
land
was
covered
with
the
bodies
of
the
dead
;
and
so
swift
and
speedy
was
the
war
,
that
there
was
none
left
to
bury
the
dead
,
but
they
did
march
forth
from
the
shedding
of
blood
,
to
the
shedding
of
blood
,
leaving
the
bodies
of
both
men
,
women
and
children
,
strewed
upon
the
face
of
the
Jand
,
to
become
a
prey
to
the
worms
of
the
flesh
;
and
the
scent
thereol
went
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
even
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
;
wherefore
the
people
became
troubled
by
day
and
by
night
,
because
of
the
scent
thereof
;
nevertheless
,
Shiz
did
not
cease
to
pursue
Coriantumr
,
for
he
had
sworn
to
avenge
Bizaself
upon
Cariantumr
of
the
blood
of
his
brother
,
which
had
been
slain
,
and
the
word
of
the
Lord
which
came
to
Ether
,
that
Coriantumr
should
not
fall
by
the
sword
.
And
thas
we
see
that
the
Lord
did
visit
them
in
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
,
and
their
wickedness
and
abominations
had
prepared
way
for
their
everlasting
destruction
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Shiz
did
pursue
Coriantumr
eastward
,
even
to
the
bor
ders
by
the
seashore
,
and
there
he
gave
battle
unto
Shiz
for
the
space
of
three
days
;
and
so
terrible
was
the
destruction
among
the
armies
of
Shiz
,
that
the
people
began
to
be
fright
ened
,
and
began
to
flee
:
efore
the
armies
of
Coriantumr
;
and
they
fled
to
the
land
of
Corihor
,
and
swept
off
the
inhabitants
before
them
,
all
they
that
would
not
join
them
;
and
they
pitch
-.
ed
their
tents
in
the
valley
of
Corihor
.
And
Coriantumr
pitched
his
tents
in
the
valley
of
Shurr
.
Now
the
valley
of
Shurr
was
near
the
hill
Comnor
;
wherefore
Coriantumr
did
gather
his
armies
together
,
upon
the
hill
Comnor
,
and
did
sound
a
trumpet
unto
the
armies
of
Shiz
,
to
invite
them
forth
to
battle
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
forth
,
but
were
driven
again
;
and
they
came
the
second
time
;
and
they
were
driven
again
the
second
time
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
again
the
third
time
,
and
the
battle
became
exceedin
sore
.
Andit
came
to
pass
that
Shiz
smote
upon
Coriantumy
that
he
gave
him
many
deep
wounds
.
And
Coriantumr
hav
ing
lost
his
blood
,
fainted
,
and
was
carried
away
as
though
b
[File:575]
were
dead
.
Now
the
loss
of
men
,
women
and
children
,
on
bath
sides
,
were
so
great
that
Shiz
commanded
his
people
that
they
should
not
pursue
the
armies
of
Coriantumr
;
wherefore
they
returned
to
their
camp
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Coriantumr
had
recovered
of
his
wounds
,
he
began
to
remember
the
words
which
Ether
had
spoken
unto
him
:
He
saw
that
there
had
been
slain
by
the
sword
already
nearly
two
millions
of
his
people
,
and
he
began
to
sorrow
in
his
heart
;
yea
,
there
had
been
stain
two
millions
of
mighty
men
,
and
also
their
wives
and
their
children
.
He
began
to
repent
of
the
evil
which
he
had
done
;
he
began
to
remember
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
all
the
prophets
,
and
he
saw
them
that
they
were
fulilled
,
thus
far
,
every
whit
;
and
his
soul
mourned
,
and
refused
to
be
comforted
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
wrote
an
episile
unto
Shuz
,
desiring
him
that
he
would
spare
the
people
,
and
he
would
give
up
the
kingdom
for
the
sake
of
the
hives
of
the
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Shiz
had
received
-
his
epistle
,
he
wrote
an
episile
unto
Coriantumyr
,
that
ihe
would
give
himself
up
,
that
he
might
slay
him
with
his
own
sword
,
that
he
would
spare
the
lives
of
the
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
repented
not
of
their
iniquity
;
and
the
people
of
Coriantumr
were
stirred
up
to
anger
against
the
people
of
Shiz
;
and
the
people
of
Shiz
were
stirred
up
to
anger
against
the
pedple
of
Coriantumr
;
wherefore
the
people
of
Shiz
did
give
battie
unto
the
people
of
Coriantumr
,—
And
when
Coriantumr
saw
that
he
was
about
to
fall
,
he
fled
again
before
the
people
of
Shiz
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
came
to
the
waters
of
Ripliancum
,
which
,
by
interpretation
,
is
large
,
or
to
exceed
all
;
wherefore
,
when
they
came
to
these
waters
,
they
pitched
their
tents
;
and
Shiz
also
pitehed
his
tents
,
near
unto
them
;
and
therefore
,
on
the
morrow
,
they
did
come
to
battle
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
fought
an
exceeding
sore
baitle
,
in
the
which
Coriantumr
was
wounded
©
again
,
and
he
fainted
with
the
loss
of
blood
.
And
it
came
to”
pass
thatthe
armies
of
Coriantumr
did
press
upon
the
armies
of
Shiz
,
that
they
beat
them
,
that
they
caused
them
to
flee
before
them
;
and
they
did
flee
southward
,
and
did
pitch
their
tents
in
a
place
which
wascalled
Ogath
.
And
it
came
fopass
at
the
army
of
Coriantumr
did
pitch
their
tents
.
by
the
hill
amah
;
and
it
was
that
same
hill
where
my
father
Mormon
id
hide
up
the
records
unto
the
Lord
,
which
were
sacred
.—
_
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
gather
together
all
the
peo
[File:576]
vle
,
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
which
had
not
been
slain
,
save
it
were
Ether
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Ether
did
be
.
hold
all
the
doings
of
the
people
;
and
be
beheld
that
the
peo
.
ple
which
were
for
Coriantumr
,
were
gathered
together
to
the
army
of
Coriantumr
;
and
the
people
which
were
for
Shiz
,
Were
gathered
together
to
the
army
of
Shiz
;
wherefore
they
were
for
the
space
of
four
years
,
gathering
together
the
peo
ple
,
that
they
might
get
all
which
were
upon
the
face
of
the
and
,
and
that
they
might
receive
all
the
strength
which
it
were
possible
that
they
could
receive
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
were
all
gathered
together
,
every
one
to
the
amy
which
he
would
,
with
their
wives
,
and
their
children
;
both
met
,
women
and
chfldren
being
armed
with
weapons
of
war
,
having
shields
,
and
breast
-
plates
,
and
head
-
plates
,
and
being
clothed
after
the
manner
of
war
,
they
did
march
forth
one
against
another
,
to
battle
;
and
they
fought
all
that
day
,
and
conquered
not
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
it
was
night
they
were
weary
,
and
retired
to
their
camps
;
and
after
that
they
had
retired
to
their
camps
,
they
took
up
a
howling
anda
lamentation
for
the
loss
of
the
slain
of
their
people
;
and
so
great
were
their
cries
,
their
howlings
and
lamentations
,
that
it
did
rend
the
air
exceedingly
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
they
did
go
again
to
battle
,
and
great
and
ternible
was
that
day
;
nevertheless
they
conquered
not
,
and
when
the
night
came
again
,
they
did
rend
the
air
with
their
cries
,
and
their
howlings
,
and
their
mournings
,
for
the
loss
of
the
slain
of
their
people
,
;
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Coriantumr
wrote
again
an
episile
unto
Shiz
,
desiring
that
he
would
not
come
again
to
battle
,
but
that
he
would
take
the
kingdom
,
and
spare
the
lives
of
the
people
.
But
behold
,
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
had
ceased
str
ving
with
them
,
and
satan
had
full
power
:
over
the
hearts
of
the
people
,
for
they
were
given
up
unto
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
,
and
the
blindness
of
their
minds
,
that
they
might
be
destroyed
;
wherefore
they
went
again
to
battle
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
fought
all
that
day
,
and
when
the
night
came
they
slept
npon
their
swords
;
and
on
the
morrow
they
fought
even
until
the
night
came
;
and
when
the
night
came
they
were
drunken
with
anger
,
even
as
a
man
which
is
drunkel
with
wine
;
and
they
slept
again
upon
their
swords
;
and
the
morrow
they
fought
again
;
and
when
the
night
ea
)
they
had
all
fallen
by
the
sword
,
save
it
were
fifty
and
two
the
people
of
Coriantumr
,
and
sixty
and
nine
of
the
people
@
[File:577]
Shiz
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
slept
upon
their
swords
that
night
,
and
on
the
morrow
they
fought
again
,
and
they
contended
in
their
mights
with
their
swords
,
and
with
their
shields
,
all
that
day
;
and
when
the
night
came
there
was
thirty
and
two
of
the
people
of
Shiz
,
and
twenty
and
seven
of
the
people
of
Coriantumr
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
ate
and
slept
,
and
prepared
for
death
on
the
morrow
.
.
And
they
were
large
and
mighty
men
,
as
to
the
strength
of
men
.
Andit
came
to
pass
that
they
fought
for
the
space
of
three
hours
,
and
they
fainted
with
the
loss
of
blood
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
men
of
Coriantumr
had
received
sufficient
strength
,
that
they
could
walk
,
they
were
about
to
flee
for
their
lives
,
but
behold
,
Shiz
arose
,
and
also
his
men
,
and
he
swore
in
his
wrath
that
he
would
slay
Coriantumr
,
or
he
would
perish
by
the
sword
;
wherefore
he
did
pursue
them
,
and
on
the
morrow
he
did
overtake
them
;
and
they
fought
again
with
the
sword
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
all
fallen
by
the
sword
,
save
it
were
Coriantumr
and
Shiz
,
behold
,
Shiz
had
fainted
with
loss
of
blood
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Coriantumr
bad
leaned
upon
his
sword
,
that
he
rested
a
little
,
he
smote
off
the
head
of
Shiz
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
he
had
smote
off
the
head
of
Shiz
,
that
Shiz
raised
upon
his
hands
and
fell
;
and
after
that
he
had
struggled
for
breath
,
he
died
.
And
it
.
came
to
pass
that
Coriantumr
fell
to
the
earth
,
and
became
as
if
he
had
no
life
.
And
the
Lord
spake
unto
Ether
,
and
said
unto
him
,
Go
forth
.
And
he
went
forth
,
and
bebeld
that
the
words
of
the
Lord
had
all
been
fulfilled
;
and
he
finished
his
record
;
(

and
he
hid
them
ina
manner
that
the
people
of
Limhi
did
find
them
.
Now
the
last
-
vords
which
are
written
by
Ether
,
are
these
:
Whetherthe
Lord
will
that
I
be

:
It

I

lest

For
behold
,
their
wars
are
exceeding
fierce
among
themselves
;
and
because
of
their
hatred
,
they
put
to
death
every
Nephite
that
will
not

Christ

And

,
Moroni

will

wherefore
,
I
wander

mine
own

Wherefore
,
I
write
a
few
more
things
,
contrary
to
that
which
I
had
supposed
:
for
I
had
supposed
not
to
have
written
any
more
;
but
I
write
a

more
things
,
that
perhaps
they

be

save
they
brought
forth

it
;
neither
did
they
receive

save
they
came
forth
with

and
a
contrite
spirit
,
and

nessed
unto
the
church
that
they
truly
repented

And
none

,
save
they
took

having
a
determination
to
sere

And
after
that
they
had
been
received
ur
to
baptism
,
and
were
wrought
upon
and
cleansed
by
the
power
of
the

,
they
were
numbered
among

people
of

and
their

were
taken

that

might
be

CHAPTER
VIL
Ann
now
I
,
Moroni
,
write
a
few
of
the
words
of
my
father
Mormon
,
which
he
spake
concerning
faith
,
hope
and
charity
:
for
after
this
manner
did
he
speak
unto
the
people
,
as
he
taught
them
in
the
synagogue
which
they
had
built
for
the
place
of
worship
.
And
now
J
,
Mormon
,
speak
unto
you
,
my
beloved
brethren
;
and
it
is
by
the
grace
of
God
,
the
Father
,
and
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
,
and
his
holy
will
,
because
of
the
gift
of
his
calling
unto
me
,
that
Iam
permitted
to
speak
unto
you
at
this
time
;
wherefore
I
would
speak
unto
you
that
are
of
the
church
,
that
are
the
peaceable
followers
of
Christ
,
and
that
have
obtained
a
sufficient
hope
,
by
which
ye
can
enter
into
the
rest
of
the
Lord
,
frojn
this
time
hence
forth
,
until
ye
shall
rest
with
him
in
Heaven
.
And
now
my
brethren
,
I
judge
these
things
of
you
because
of
your
peaceable
walk
with
the
children
of
men
:
for
remember
the
word
.
of
God
,
which
saith
,
By
their
works
ye
shall
know
them
:
for
if
their
works
be
good
,
then
they
are
good
also
.
For
behold
,
God
hath
said
,
A
man
being
evil
,
cannot
do
that
which
is
good
:
for
if
pe
of
fereth
a
gift
,
or
prayeth
unto
God
,
except
he
shall
dovit
with
veal
intent
,
it
profiteth
him
nothing
.
For
behold
,
it
is
not
vounted
unto
him
for
righteousness
.
For
behold
,
if
a
man
being
evil
,
giveth
a
gift
,
he
docth
it
grudgingly
;
wherefore
it
is
counted
unto
him
the
same
as
if
he
had
retained
the
gilt
;
wherefore
he
is
counted
cvil
before
God
.
And
likewise
also
is
it
counted
cyil
unto
a
man
,
if
he
shall
pray
,
and
not
with
real
intent
of
heart
;
yea
,
and
it
profiteth
him
nothing
:
for
God
receiveth
none
such
;
wherefore
,
4
man
being
evil
,
cannot
do
that
which
is
good
;
neither
will
he
.
give
a
good
gift
.
For
he
hold
,
a
bitter
fountain
cannot
bring
-
forth
good
water
;
neither
can
a
good
fountain
bring
forth
bilter
water
;
wherefore
a
man
being
the
servant
of
the
Devil
,
cannot
follow
Christ
;
and
if
he
follow
Christ
,
he
cannot
be
a
servant
of
the
Devil
.
Wherefore
,
all
things
which
are
good
,
cometh
of
God
;
and
that
which
is
evil
,
cometh
of
the
Devil
:
for
the
Devil
is
an
enemy
unto
God
,
and
fighteth
against
him
continually
,
and
inviteth
and
eniceth
to
sin
,
and
to
do
that
which
is
evil
continually
,
But
hold
,
that
which
is
of
God
,
inviteth
and
enticeth
to
do
good
tinuelly
;
wherefore
,
every
thing
which
inviteth
and
:
enti
th
to
-
do
goad
,
and
to
love
God
,
and
to
serve
him
,
is
inspired
®f
God
.
Wherefore
take
heed
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
that
ye
do
not
judge
that
which
is
evil
to
be
of
God
,
or
that
which
is

and
of

it
is
given
unto
you
to

that
ye
may

geod
from
evil
;
and
the
way
to
judge
is
as
plain
,
that
ye
may
know
with
a
perfect
knowledge
,
as
the
daylight
is
from
the
dark
night
—
For
behold
,
the
spirit
of
Christ
is
given
to
every
man
,
:
that
they
may
know
good
from
evil
;
wherefore
I
shew
unto
you
the
way
to
judge
:
for
every
thing
which
inviteth
to
do
good
,
and
to
persuade
to
believe
in
Christ
,
is
sent
forth
by
the
power
and
gift
of
Christ
;
wherefore
ye
may
know
with
a
perfect
knowledge
,
it
is
of
God
;
but
whatsoever
thing
persuadeth
men
to
do
evil
,
and
believe
not
in
Christ
,
and
deny
him
,
and
serve
not
God
,
then
ye
may
know
with
@
perfect
knowledge
it
is
of
the
Devil
,
for
after
this
manner
doth
the
Devil
work
:
for
he
persuadeth
no
man
to
do
good
,
no
not
one
;
neither
doth
oe
angels
;
neither
doth
they
which
subject
themselves
unto
im
.
And
now
my
brethren
,
seeing
that
ye
know
the
light
by
which
ye
may
judge
,
which
light
is
the
light
of
Christ
,
see
that
ye
do
not
judge
wrongfully
:
for
with
,
that
same
judgement
which
ye
judge
,
ye
shall
also
be
judged
.

Wherefore
I
beseech
of
you
,
brethren
,
that
ye
should
scar
igently
in
the
light
of
Christ
,
that
ye
may
know
good
from
evil
;
and
if
ye
will
lay
hold
upon
every
good
thing
,
and
condemn
it
not
,
ye
certainly
wil
be
a
child
of
Christ
.
And
now

my
brethren

hows
it

that

And
now
come
to
that
faith
,
of
which
I
said
I
would
speak
;
ant
I
will
tell
you
the
way
whereby
ye
may
lay
hold
on
every
good
thing
.
For
behold
,
God
knowing
all
things
,
being
from
ever
lasting
to
everlasting
,
behold
,
he
sent
angels
to
minister
unto
the
children
of
men
,
to
make
manifest
concerning
the
coming
of
Christ
;
andin
Christ
there
shouldeome
every
good
thing
,
And
God
also
declared
unto
prophets
,
by
his
own
mouth
,
thal
Christ
should
come
.
And
behold
,
there
were
diverse
ways
that
he
did
manifest
things
unto
the
children
of
men
,
which
were
good
;
andall
things
which
are
good
,
cometh
of
Christ
,
otherwise
men
were
fallen
,
and
there
could
no
good
thing
come
unto
them
,
Wherefore
,
by
the
ministering
of
angels
,
and
by
every
word
which
proceeded
forth
out
of
the
mouth
of
G
men
began
to
exervise
faith
in
Christ
;
and
thus
by
faith
,
th
did
lay
hold
upon
every
good
thing
:
and
thus
itwas
antil
coming
of
Christ
.
And
after
that
he
came
,
men
also
.
wi
saved
by
faithin
his
name
;
and_by
faith
,
they
become
t
sons
of
God
.
And
as
Suredly
as
Christ
liveth
,
he
spake'
these
[File:583]
words
unto
our
fathers
,
saying
,
Whatsoever
thing
ye
shall
ack
the
Father
in
my
name
;
which
is
good
,
in
faith
believing
that
ye
shall
receive
,
bebold
,
it
shall
be
done
unto
you
.
Wherefore
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
hath
miracles
ceased
,
because
that
Christ
hath
ascended
into
heaven
,
arid
hath
set
down
on
the
tight
band
of
God
,
to
claim
of
the
Father
his
rights
of
mercy
which
he
hath
upon
the
children
of
men
;
for
he
hath
answered
the
ends
of
the'
law
,
and
he
claimeth
all
those
that
hath
faith
in
him
;
and
they
that
have
faith
in
him
,
will
cleave
unto
every
good
thing
;
wherefore
he
advocateth
the
cause
of
the
children
of
men
;
and
he
dwelleth
eternally
in
the
heavens
.—
And
because
that
he
hath
done
this
,
my
beloved

hath

Behold
I
say
unto
you
,
Nay
;
neither
hath
angels
ceased
to

unto
the
children

For
behold
,
they
are

that

by
so
doing

the

prepareth
the
way
that
the

that
they
are
true
;
and
if
they
are
true
,
hath
the
day
of
miracles
ceased
?
or
hath
angels
ceased
to
appear
unto
the
children
of
men
?
or
hath
he
withheld
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
from
hem
?
or
will
he
,
so
long
as
time
shall
last
,
or
the
earth
shall
tand
,
or
there
shall
be
onc
man
upon
the
face
thereof
to
be
saved
?
Behold
I
say
unte
you
Nay
,
for
it
is
by
faith
that
miracles
are
wrought
;
and
it
is
by
faith
that
angels
appear
and
minister
unto
men
;
wherefore
if
these
things
have
ceased
,
wo
—
[File:584]
be
unto
the
children
of
,
men
,
for
it
is
because
of
unbelief
,
and
allis
vain
:
for
no
man
can
:
be
saved
,
according
to
the
words
of
Christ
,
save
they
shall
have
faith
in
his
name
;
wherefore
,
if
these
things
have
ceased
,
then
has
faith
ceased
also
;
and
awful
is
the
state
of
man
:
for
they
are
as
though
there
had
been
uo
redemption
made
.
But
behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
judge
better
things
of
you
,
for
J
judge
that
ye
have
faith
im
Christ
,
because
of
your
meekness
:
for
if
ye
have
not
faith
in
him
,
then
ye
are
not
fit
to
be
numbered
among
the
people
of
his
church
.
And
again
my
beloved
brethren
,
1
would
speak
unto
you
concerning
hope
.
How
is
it
that
ye
can
attain
unto
faith
,
save
ye
shall
have
hope
?
And
what
is
it
that
ye
shall
hope
for
?
”
Behold
1
say
unto
you
,
That
ye
shall
have
hope
through
the
atonement
of
Christ
and
the
power
of
his
resurrection
,
to
be
raised
unto
life
eternal
;
and
this
because
of
your
faith
in
him
according
to
the
promise
;
wherefore
,
if
a
man
have
faith
,
he
must
needs
have
hope
:
for
without
faith
there
cannot
be
any
hope
.
And
again
:
Behold
I
say
unto
you
,
That
he
cannot
have
faith
and
hope
,
save
he
shall
be
meek
,
and
lowly
of
heart
:
if
so
,
his
faith
and
hope
is
vain
,
for
none
is
acceptable
before
God
,
save
the
meek
and
lowly
of
heart
;
and
$f
a
man
be
meck
and
lowly
in
heart
,
and
confesses
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
,
he
must
needs
have
charity
:
for
if
he
have
not
charity
,
he
is
nothing
;
wherefore
he

wherefore
,
my

if

have

,
ye
are
nothing
,
for
charity
never
faileth
.
Wherefore

cleave

nto
charity

which
is

of

,
for

forever
;

it

it

CHAPTER
YIIL
Aw
epistle
of
my
father
Mormon
,
written
to
me
,
Moroni
;
and
it
was
written
unto
me
soon
after
my
calling
to
the
:
ministry
.
And
on
this
wise
did
he
write
unto
me
,
Saying
:
My
beloved
son
Moroni
,
I
rejoice
exceedingly
that
your
Lord
Jesus
Christ
hath
been
mindful
of
you
,
and
hath
called
you
to
his
ministry
,
and
to
bis
holy
work
.
Tam
mindful
of
you
always
in
my
prayers
,
continually
praying
unto
God
the
Father
,
in
the
name
of
his
holy
child
,
Jesus
,
that
he
,
through
his
infinite
goodness
and
grace
,
will
keep
you
through
the
endurance
of
faith
on
his
name
to
the
end
.
And
now
my
son
,
I
speak
wnto
you
concerning
that
which
grieveth
me
exceedingly
:
for
it
grieveth
me
that
there
should
disputations
rise
among
you
.
For
if
I
have
learned
the
truth
:
there
has
been
disputations
among
you
concerning
the
baptism
of
your
little
children
.
And
now
my
son
,
I
desire
that
ye
should
labor
diligently
,
that
this
gross
error
should
be
removed
from
among
you
:
for
,
for
this
intent
I
have
written
this
epistle
.
For
immediately
after
I
had
learned
these
things
of
you
,
I
inquired
of
the
Lord
concerning
the
matter
.
And
the
word
of
the
Lord
came
to
me
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
saying
,
Listen
to
the
words
of
Christ
,
your
Redeemer
,
your
Lord
and
your
God
.
Behold
,
1
came
into
the
world
not
to
call
the
righteous
,
but
sinners
to
repentance
;
the
whole
need
no
physician
,
but
they
that
are
sick
;
wherefore
little
children
are
whole
,
for
they
are
not
capable
of
committing
sin
;
wherefore
the
curse
of
Adam
is
taken
from
them
in
me
,
that
it
hath
no
power
over
them
:
and
the
law
of
circumcision
is
done
.
away
in
me
.
And
after
this
manner
did
the
Holy
Ghost
manifest
the
word
of
God
unto
me
;
wherefore
my
beloved
soi
a
know
that
it
is
solemn
mockery
before
God
,
that
ye
should
baptize
little
children
.
Behold
I
say
unto
you
,
that
this
thing
shall
ye
teach
,
repentance
and
baptism
unto
they
which
are
accountable
and
capable
of
committing
sin
;
yea
,
teach
parents
that
they
must
repent
and
be
baptized
,
and
humble
themselves
.
as
their
little
children
,
and
they
shall
all
be
saved
with
their
little
children
;
and
their
little
children
necd
no
repentance
,
neither
baptism
.
Behold
,
baptism
is
unto
repentance
to
the
fulfilling
the
commandments
unto
the
remission
of
sins
.
But
little
children
are
alive
in
Christ
,
even
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
:
if
not
so
,
God
is
a
partial
God
,
and
also
a
changeble
God
,
and
a
respecter
to
persons
:
for
how
many
little
children
[File:586]
have
died
without
baptism
.
Wherefore
,
if
little
children
could
not
be
saved
without
baptism
,
these
must
have
gone
to
an
endless
hell
.
Behold
I'say
unto
you
,
That
he
that
supposeth
that
little
children
needeth
baptism
,
is
in
the
gall
of
bitterness
,
and
inthe
bonds
iniquity
:
for
he
hath
neither
faith
,
hope
,
nor
charity
;
wherefore
,
should
he
be
cut
off
while
in
the
thought
,
he
must
go
down
to
hell
,
For
awful
is
the
wickedness
to
suppose
that
God
saveth
one
child
because
of
baptism
,
and
the
other
must
perish
because
he
hath
no
baptism
.
Wo
be
unto
him
that
shall
pervert
the
ways
of
the
Lord
after
this
manner
,
for
they
shall
perish
,
except
they
repent
.
Behold
,
1
speak
with
boldness
,
having
authority
from
God
;
and
I
fear
not
what
man
can
do
:
for
perfect
love
casteth
out
all
fear
;
and
1
am
filled
with
charity
,
which
is
everlasting
love
;
wherefore
all
children
are
alike
unto
me
;
wherefore
I
Jove
little
children
with
a
perfect
love
;
and
they
are
all
alike
,
and
partakers
of
salvation
.
For
I
know
that
God
is
not
a
partial
God
,
neither
a
changeable
being
;
but
he
is
unchangeable
from
all
eternity
to
all
eternity
.
Little
children
cannot
repent
;
wherefore
it
is
awful
wickedness
to
deny
the
pure
mercies
of
God
unto
them
,
for
they
are
all
alive
m
him
because
of
his
mercy
.
And
he
that
saith
that
little
children
needeth
baptism
,
denieth
the
mercies
of
Christ
,
and
setteth
at
nought
the
atonement
of
him
and
the
power
of
his
redemption
.
Wo
unto
such
,
for
they
are
in
danger
of
death
,
hell
,
and
an
endless
torment
.
I
speak
it
boldly
,
God
hath
commanded
me
.
List
:
en
unto
them
and
give
heed
,
or
they
stand
against
you
at
the
judgement
seat
of
Christ
.
For
hehold
-
that
all
little
children
are
alive
in
Christ
,
and
also
all
they
that
are
without
the
law
.
For
the
power
of
redemption
cometh
on
all
they
that
have
no
Jaw
;
wherefore
,
he
that
is
not
condemned
,
or
he
that
is
under
no
condemnation
,
cannot
repent
;
and
unto
such
baptism
availeth
nothing
.
But
it
is
mockery
before
God
,
denying
the
mercies
of
Christ
,
and
the
power
.
of
his
holy
spirit
,
and
putting
trust
in
dead
works
.
'
Behold
,
my
son
,
this
thing
had
not
~
ought
tobe
:
for
repentance
is
unto
them
that
are
under
condemnation
,
and
under
the
curse
of
a
broken
law
.
And
the
first
fruits
of
repentance
is
baptism
;
and
baptism
cometh
by
faith
,
unto
the
fulfilling
the
commandments
;
and
the
fulfilling
the
commandments
bringeth
remission
of
sins
;
and
the
remission
of
sins
bringeth
meekness
,
and
lowliness
of
heart
;
and
because
of
meekness
ahd
lowliness
of
heart
,
cometh
the
visitation
of
.
the
Holy
Ghost
,
which
comforter
filleth
with
hope
[File:587]
end
perfect
love
,
which
love
endureth
by
diligence
unto
prayer
,
until
the
end
shall
come
,
when
all
the
saints
shall
dwell
with
God
.
.
Behold
,
my
son
,
I
will
write
unto
you
again
,
if
I
go
not
out
soon
against
the
Lamanites
.
Behold
,
the
pride
of
this
nation
,
or
the
people
of
the
Nephites
,
hath
proved
their
destraction
,
except
they
should
repent
.
.
Pray
for
them
,
my
son
,
that
repentance
may
come
unto
them
.
But
behold
,
I
fear
lest
the
spirit
hath
ceased
striving
with
them
;
and
in
this
part
of
the
Jand
they
are
also
sceking
to
put
down
all
power
and
authority
,
which
cometh
from
God
;
and
they
are
denying
the
Holy
Ghost
.
And
after
rejecting
so
great
a
knowledge
,
my
son
,
they
must
perish
soon
,
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
prophecies
which
was
spoken
by
the
prophets
,
as
well
as
the
words
of
our
Saviour
himself
.
Farewell
,
my
son
,
until
I
shall
write
unto
you
,
or
shall
meet
you
again
.
Amen

CHAPTER
IX
.
The
second
epistle
of
Mormon
to
his
son
Moroni
.
My
beloved
son
,
J
write
unto
you
again
,
that
ye
may
know
that
I
am
yet
alive
;
but
I
write
somewhat
that
which
is
grievous
.
For
behold
,
I
have
had
a
sore
battle
with
the
Lamanites
,
in
the
which
we
did
not
conquer
;
and
Archeantus
has
fallen
by
the
sword
,
and
also
Luram
and
Emron
;
yea
,
and
we
have
lost
a
great
number
of
our
choice
men
,
And
now
behold
,
my
son
,
'I
fear
lest
the
Lamanites
shall
destroy
this
people
,
for
they
do
not
repent
,
and
Satan
stirreth
them
up
contin
-.
ually
to
anger
,
one
with
another
.
Behold
,
J
am
laboring
with
them
continually
;
and
when
I
speak
the
word
of
God
with
sharpness
,
they
tremble
and
anger
against
me
;
and
when
I
use
no
sharpness
,
they
harden
their
hearts
against
it
;
wherefore
I
fear
lest
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
hath
ceased
striving
with
them
.
For
so
exceedingly
do
they
anger
,
that
it
seemeth
me
:
that
they
have
no
fear
of
death
;
and
they
have
lost
their'love
,
one
towards
another
;
and
they
thirst
after
blood
and
revenge
continually
.
And
now
my
beloved
son
,
notwithstanding
their
hardness
,
let
us
labor
diligently
:
for
if
we
should
cease
to
labor
,
we
should
be
brought
under
condemnation
:
for
we
have
a
labor
to
perform
whilst
im
this
tabernacle
of
clay
,
that
we
[File:588]
may
conquer
the
enemy
.
of
all
righteousness
,
and
rest
our
souls
in
the
kingdom
of
God
,
2
And
now
I
write
somewhat
concernirig
the
sufferings
of
thie
people
.
For
aceording
to
the
knowledge
which
I
have
received
[rom
Amoron
,
behold
,
the
Lamanites
have
many
pris
:
oners
,
which
they
took
.
from
the
tower
of
Sherrizah
;
and
there
were
men
,
women
.
and
children
.
And
the
husbands
and
fathers
of
those
women
and
children
they
have
slain
;
and
they
feed
the
women
upon
the
flesh
of
their
husbands
,
and
the
children
upon
the
(
lesh
of
their
fathers
;
and
no
water
,
save
a
little
,
do
they
give
unto
them
.
And
notwithstanding
this
great
abomination
of
the
Lamanites
,
it
doth
not
exceed
that
of
our
people
in
Moriantum
.
For
behold
,
many
of
the
daughters
of
the
Lamanites
have
they
taken
prisoners
;
and
after
depriving
them
of
that
which
was
most
dear
and
pre+
cious
above
all
things
,
which
is
chastity
and
virtue
;
and
after
that
they
had
done
this
thing
,
they
-
did
murder
them
in
a
most
_
eruel
manner
,
torturing
their
bodies
even
unto
death
;
and
af
:
ter
that
they
have
done
this
,
they
devour
their
flesh
like
unto
wild
beasts
,
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
;
and
they
do
it
for
a
token
of
bravery
.
O
my
beloved
son
,
how
can
a
people
like
this
,
that
are
without
civilization
;
(
and
only
a
few
years
have
passed
away
,
and
they
were
a
civil
and
a
delight
some
people
;)
but
O
my
son
,
how
can
a
people
like
this
;
whose
delight
is
in
so
much
abomination
,
how
can
we
expect
that
God
will
stay
his
hand
in
judgement
against
us
?
Behold
,
iny
heart
cries
wo
unto
this
people
.
Come
out
in
judgement
,
O
God
,
and
hide
their
sins
,
and
wickedness
,
and
abominations
from
before
thy
face
.
And
again
,
my
son
,
there
are
many
widows
and
their
daughters
,
which
remain
in
Sherrizah
;
and
_
that
part
of
the
provisions
which
the
Lamanites
did
not
carry
away
,
behold
,
the
army
of
Zenephi
has
carried
away
,
and
left
them
to
wander
withersoever
they
can
for
food
;
and
many
old
women
do
faint
by
the
way
and
die
.
And
the
army
which
is
with
me
,
is
weak
;
and
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
are
betwixt
Sherrizah
and
me
;
and
as
many
as
have
fled
to
the
army
of
Aaron
,
have
fallen
victims
to
their
awful
brutality
.
0
the
depravity
of
my
people
!
they
are
without
order
and
without
mercy
.
Behold
,
I
am
but
a
man
,
and
Thave
but
the
strength
of
aman
,
and
I
cannot
any
longer
enforce
my
commands
;
and
they
have
become
strong
in
their
perversion
;
and
they
are”
alike
brutal
,
sparing
nohe
,
neither
old
nor
young
;
and
they
de”
[File:589]
light
in
every
thing
save
that
which
is
good
;
and
the
sufferings
of
our
women
and
our
children
upon
ali
the
face
of
this
land
,
doth
exceed
every
thing
;
yea
,
tongue
cannot
tell
,
neither
can
it
be
written
.
And
now
my
son
,
I
dwell
no
longer
upon
this
horrible
scene
.
Behold
,
thou
knowest
the
wickedness
of
this
people
;
thou
knowest
that
they
are
without
principle
.
and
past
feeling
;
and
their
wickedness
doth
exceed
that
of
the
Lamanites
.
Behold
,
my
son
,
I
cannot
recommend
them
unto
Gol
,
lest
he
should
smite
me
.
_
But
beold
,
my
son
,
I
reeommend
thee
unto
God
,
and
I
trust
in
Christ
that
thou
wilt
be
saved
;
and
I
pray
unto
God
that
he
would
spare
thy
life
,
to
witness
the
return
of
his
people
unto
him
,
or
their
utter
destruction
:
for
I
know
that
they
must
perish
,
except
they
repent
and
return
unte
him
;
and
if
they
perish
,
it
will
be
like
unto
the
Jaredites
,
because
of
the
wilfulness
of
their
hearts
,
seeking
for
blood
and
revenge
.
And
if
it
so
be
that
they
perish
,
we
know
that
many
of
our
brethren
have
dissented
over
untothe
Lamanites
,
and
many
more
will
also
dissent
over
unto
them
;
wherefore
,
write
somewhat
a
few
things
,
if
thou
art
spared
;
and
I
shall
perish
and
not
see
thee
;
but
I
trust
that
I
may
see
thee
soon
:
for
Ihave
sacred
records
that
I
would
deliver
up
unto
thee
.
My
son
,
be
faithful
in
Christ
;
and
may
not
the
things
which
I
have
written
,
grieve
thee
,
to
weigh
thee
down
unto
death
,
but
may
Christ
lift
thee
up
,
and
may
his
sufferings
and
death
,
and
the
shewing
his
body
unto
our4athers
,
and
his
mercy
and
long
suffering
,
and
the
hope
of
his
glory
and
of
eternal
life
,
rest
in
your
mind
forever
..
And
may
the
grace
of
God
the
Father
,
whose
throne
is
high
in
the
heavens
,
and
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
,
who
sitteth
on
the
right
hand
of
his
power
,
until
all
things
shall
become
subject
unto
him
,
be
,
and
abide
with
you
forever
.
Amen

CHAPTER
X
.
Now
I
,
Moroni
,
write
somewhat
as
seemeth
me
good
;
and
{
write
unto
my
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
;
and
I
would
that
they
should
kmow
that
more
than
four
hundred
and
twenty
_
years
has
passed
away
,
since
the
sign
was
given
of
the
coming
of
Christ
.
And
I
seal
up
these
records
,
afterthat
I
have
spocen
a
few
words
by
way
of
exhortation
unto
you
.
Behold
,
I
would
exhort
you
that
when
ye
shall
read
these
things
,
ifit
be
a
[File:590]
wisdom
in
God
that
ye
should
read
them
,
that
ye
would
remember
how
,
merciful
the
Lord
hath
been
unto
the
children
of
men
,
from
the
creation
of
Adam
,
even
down
until
the
time
that
ye
shall
receive
these
things
,
and
ponder
it
in
your
hearts
,
And
when
ye
shall
receive
these
things
,
would
exhort
.
you
that
ye
would
ask
God
,
the
Eternal
Father
,
in
the
name
of
Christ
,
if
these
things
are
not
true
;
dnd
if
ye
shall
ask
witha
sincere
heart
,
with
real
intent
,
having
faith
in
Christ
,
and
he
J
avill
manifest
the
truth
of
it
unto
you
,
by
the
power
of
the
Hoty
Ghost
;
and
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
ye
may
know
the
truth
of
all
things
.
And
whatsoever
thing
is
good
,
is
just
_
and
true
;
wherefore
,
nothing
that
is
good
denicth
the
Christ
,
but
.
acknowledgeth
that
he
is
.
And
ye
may
know
that
he
is
;
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;
wherefore
I
would
exhort
you
,
that
ye
deny
not
the
power
of
God
:
for
he
worketh
by
power
,
according
to
the
faith
of
the
children
of
men
,
the
same
to-day
,
and
to
-
morrow
,
and
forever
.
And
again
I
exhort
you
,
my
brethren
,
that
ye
deny
not
the
gifts
of
God
,
for
they
are
many
;
and
they
come
from
the
same
God
.
And
there
are
different
ways
that
these
gifts
are
administered
;
but
it
is
the
same
,
God
which
worketh
all
in
all
:
and
they
are
given
by
the
manifestations
of
the
spirit
of
God
unto
men
,
to
profit
them
.
For
behold
,
to
one
is
given
by
the
spirit
of
God
,
that
he
may'
teach
the
word
of
wisdom
;
and
to
another
,
that
he
may
teach
the
word
of
knowledge
by
the
same
spirit
;
and
to
another
,
exeeeding
great
faith
;
and
to
another
,
the
gifts
of
healing
by
the
same
spirit
.
And
again
,
to
another
,
that
he
may
work
—
mighty
miracles
;
and
again
,
to
another
,
that
he
may
prophesy
concerning
all
things
;
and
again
,
to
another
,
the
beholding
of
_
angels
and
ministering
spirits
;
and
again
,
to
another
,
all
kinds
of
tongues
;
and
.
again
,
to
another
,
the
interpretation
of
lan
:
guages
and
-
of
diverse
kinds
of
tongues
.
And
all
these
gifts
comes
by
the
spirit
of
Christ
;
and
they
come
unto
every
mat
severally
,
according
as
he
will
.
And
I
would
exhort
you
,
my
~
beloyed
brethren
,
that
ye
remember
that
every
good
gift
cometh
of
Christ
.
And
I
would
exhort
you
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
that
ye
remember
that
he
is
the
same
yesterday
,
to-day
,
and
forever
,
and
that
all
these
gifts
of
which
I
have
spoken
,
which
are
spiritual
,
never
will
be
done
away
,
even
as
long
as
i
world
shall
stand
,
only
according
to
the
unbelief
of
the
chit
dren
of
men
.
Wherefore
,
there
must
be
faith
;
and
if
there”
must
be
faith
,
there
must
also
be
hope
;
and
if
there
must
he
hope
,
there
must
also
be
charity
;
and
except
ye
have
charity
,
[File:591]
ye
can
in
no
wise
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
God
;
neither
ean
ye
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
God
,
if
ye
have
not
faith
;
neither
can
ye
,
if
ye
have
no
hope
;
and
if
ye
have
no
hope
,
ye
must
needs
be
in
despair
;
and
despair
comcth
because
of
iniquity
.
And
Christ
truly
said
unto
our
fathers
,
If
ye
have
faith
,
ye
can
do
all
things
which
is
expedient
unto
me
.
And
now
I
speak
unto
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
,
that
if
the
day
.
cometh
that
the
power
and
gifts
of
God
shall
be
done
away
among
you
,
it
shall
be
because
of
unbelief
.
And
wo
be
unto
the
children
of
men
,
if
this
be
the
case
:
for
there
shall
be
none
that
doeth
good
among
you
,
no
not
one
.
For
if
there
be
one
among
you
that
doeth
good
,
he
shall
work
by
the
power
and
gifts
of
God
.
And
wo
unto
them
which
shall
do
these
things
away
and
die
,
for
they
die
in
their
sins
,
and
they
cannot
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
God
;
and
I
speak
it
according
to
the
words
of
Christ
,
and
I
lie
not
.
And
I
exhort
you
to
remember
these
things
:
for
the
time
speedily
cometh
that
ye
shall
know
that
I
lie
not
,
for
yeshall
see
me
at
the
bar
of
God
:
and
the
Lord
God
will
say
unto
you
,
Did
I
not
declare
my
words
unio
you
,
which
was
written
by
this
man
,
like
as
one
erying
from
the
dead
?
yea
,
even
as
one
speaking
out
of
the
dust
,
I
declare
these
things
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
prophecies
.
And
behold
,
they
shall
proceed
forth
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
everlasting
God
;
and
his
word
shall
hiss
forth
from
generation
to
generation
,
And
God
shall
shew
unto
you
,
that
that
which
I
have
written
,
is
true
.
And
again
I
would
exhort
you
,
that
ye
would
come
unto
Christ
,
and
lay
hold
upon
every
good
gift
,
and
touch
not
the
evil
gift
,
nor
the
unclean
thing
:—
And
awake
,
andarise
from
the
dust
,
O
Jerusalem
;
yea
,
and
puton
thy
beautiful
garments
,
O
daughter
of
Zion
,
and
strengthen
thy
stakes
,
and
enlarge
thy
borders
forever
,
that
thou
mayest
no
more
be
confounded
,
that
the
covenants
of
the
Eternal
Father
,
which
he
hath
made
unto
thee
,
O
house
of
Israel
,
may
be
fulfilled
.
Yea
,
come
unto
Christ
,
and
be
perfected
in
him
,
and
deny
yourselves
of
all
ungodtiness
;
and
if
ye
shall
deny
yourselves
of
all
ungodliness
,
and
love
God
with
all
your
might
,
mind
and
strength
,
then
is
his
grace
sufficient
for
you
,
that
by
his
grace
ye
may
be
perfect
in
Christ
;
and
if
by'
the
grace
of
God
ye
are
perfect
in
Christ
,
ye
can
in
no
wise
deny
the
power
of
God
,
And
again
,
if
ye
,
by
the
grace
of
God
are
perfect
in
Christ
,
and
deny
not
his
power
,
then
are
ye
sancti
-
_
fied
in
Christ
by
the
grace
of
God
,
tbrough
the
shedding
of
the
blood
of
Christ
,
which
is
in
the
covenant
of
the
Father
,
[File:592]
unto
the
remission
of
your
sine
,
that
ye
became
holy
without
spot
.
And
now
J
bid
unto
all
,
farewell
.
Isoon
go
to
rest
in
the
paradise
of
God
,
until
my
spirit
and
body
shall
again
reunite
,
and
I
am
brought
forth
triumphant
through
the
air
,
to
meet
you
before

of
