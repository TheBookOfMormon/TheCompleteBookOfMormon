was murdered upon his throne, and Akish reigned in
his stead. And it came {o.pass that Akish began-to
be. jealous of his.son, therefore he shut him up in pris-
on, and kept him upon little or.no food, until he.had
suffered:death.. And now the brother, of him that suf
fered death, (and-his, name was Nimrah,) was angry
with his father, because.of that which his father had
done unto his brother. And it came to pass that Nim-
rah gathered together a small number of men, and fled
out of the land, and.came-over and dwelt with Omer,
And it came to pass that Akish begat other sons, and
they won the. hearts of the people, notwithstanding
they-had sworn unto him to do. all manner of iniquity,
according to that which he desired. Now. the people
of Akish were desirous for gain, even as Akish was
desirous for power; wherefore the sons of Akish did
offer them money, by which means they drew away
the more part of the people after them; and there be-
