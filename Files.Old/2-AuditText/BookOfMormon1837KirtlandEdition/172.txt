been spoken of; neither is there any conditions where-
by man can be saved, except the conditions which 
have told you. Believe in God; believe that he is,
and that he created all things, both in heaven and in
earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power,
both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth
not comprehend all the things which the Lord can
comprehend. And again: Believe that ye must re-
pent of your sins and forsake them, and humble your-
selves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that
he would forgive you: and now, if you believe all
these things see that ye do them. And again I say
unto you as I have said before, that as ye have come
to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have
known of his goodness, and have tasted of h:s love,

fight and quarrel one with another, and serve the dev-
il, who is the master: of sin, or who is the evil spirit
which hath been spoken of by our fathers; he being
an enemy to all righteousness; but ye will teach them
to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will
teach them to love one another, and to serve one an-

stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of
your substance unto him that standeth in need; and
ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his peti-
