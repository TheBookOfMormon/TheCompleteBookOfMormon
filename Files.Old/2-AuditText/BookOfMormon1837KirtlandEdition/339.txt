did not let the people know concerning. their desires;
therefore they found out privily the minds of all the
people.

And if came to pass that after they had found out
the minds of all the people, those who were in favor
of the words which had been spoken by Alma and his
brethren, were cast out of the land; and they were
many; and they came over also into the land of Jer-
shon.

And it came to pass that Alma and his brethren did
minister unto them. Now the people of the Zorarnites
were angry with the people of Ammon who were in
Jershon, and the chief ruler of the Zoramites being a
very wicked man, sent over unto the people of Ammon
desiring them that they should cast out of their land

And he breathed out many threatnings against them,

the Lamanites, and the armics of the Zoramites; and
thus commenced a war betwixt the Lamanites and the
Nephites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the
udges; and an account shall be given of their wars

ereafier. And Alma, and Ammon, and their breth-
ten, and also the two sons of Alma, returned to the
land of Zarahemla, after having been instruments in
the hands of God of bringing-many of the Zoramites
to repentance; and ag many as were brought to re-
