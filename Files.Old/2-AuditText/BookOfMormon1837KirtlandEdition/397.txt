overâ€™you, except ye repent and withdraw your armies
into your own lands, or the lands of your possessions,
which is the land of Nephi; yea, ] would tell you
these things, if ye were capable of hearkening unto
them; yea, I would tell you concerning that awful
hell that awaits to receive such murderers as thou and
thy brother have been, except ye repent and withdraw ~
your murderous purposes, and return,.with your ar-
mies to your. own lands; but as ye have rejected these
things, and have fought against the people of the Lord,
even so  may expect you will do it again.

And now behold, we are prepared to receive you;
yea, and except you withdraw your purposes, behold,
ye will pull dawn the wrath of that God whom you
have rejected, upon you, even to your utter destruc-
tion; but as the Lord liveth, our armies shall come

visited with death, for we will retain our cities and our

only sought to defend ourszlves: But behold, if ye
seek to destroy us more, we will seek to destroy you;
yea, and we willseek our land of our first inheritance.
Now I close my epistle. I am Moroni;  ama leader
of the people of the Nephites.

Now it came to pass that Ammoron, when he had
Teceived this epistile, he was angry; and he. wrote
another epistle unto Moroni; und these are the words
which he wrote, saying,  am sAmmoron, the king of
the Lamanites:. J-am the brother:of Amalickiah; whom
