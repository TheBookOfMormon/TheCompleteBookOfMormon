soldiers to anger, to contend more powerfully against
the Nephites. And now Moroni was angry, because
of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he
commanded his people that they should fall upon them
and slay them. And it came to pass that they began
toslay them; yea, and the Lamanites did contend
with their swords.and theirmights. But.behold, their
naked skins, and their bare heads, were exposed to the
sharp swords of the Nephites; yea, behold, they were
pierced and smitten; yea, and did fall exceeding fast
before theâ€™swords of the Nephites;. and they began to
be swept down, even as the soldier of Moroni had
prophesied. Now Zerahemnah, when he saw that
they were all about to be destroyed, cried mightily un-
to. Moroni, promising that he would covenant, and al-
so his people, with them, if they would spare the re-
mainder of their lives, that they never would come to
war again against them. And it.came to pass that
Moroni caused that the work of death should cease
again among the people. And he took the weapons
of war from the Lamanites; and afler they had enter-
ed into a covenant with him of peace, they were suf-
fered to depart into the wilderness. Now.the number
of their dead were not numbered, because of the great-
ness of the number; yea, the number of their dead
were exceeding great, both on the Nephites,, and on
the Lamanites. And it came to pass that they did
cast their dead into the waters of Sidon; and they
have gone forth, and are buried in the depths of the
sea. And the armies of the Nephites, or of Moroni,
returned, and came to their houses, and their lands. .
And thus ended the eighteenth year of the reign of
the judges over the people of Nephi. And thus ended
the record of Alma, which was wrote upon the plates
of Nephi.
