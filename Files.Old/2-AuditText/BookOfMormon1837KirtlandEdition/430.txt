atand against the Nephites, insomuch with his'strength.
and also with his great wisdom, that by sending himâ€™
forth, he.should gain power over the Nephites; there:
fore he.did stir them up to anger, and he did gather
together his armies, and he did appoint Coriantumr to
be their leader, and did cause that they should march
down to the land of Zarahemla, to battle against the
Nephites. :

And it came to pass that because of so much conten-
tion and so much difficully in the government, that
they had not kept sufficient guards in the land of Za-
rahemla; for they had supposed-that the Lamanites
durst not come into the heart of their lands to attack
that great city Zarahemla., But it came to pass that
Coriantumr did march forth at the head of his numer:
ous host, and came upon the inhabitantsof the city,
and their march was with such exceeding great speed,
that there was no time tor the Nephites to gather to-
gether their armies; therefore Coriantumr did cut
down the watch by the entrance of the city, and did
march forth with his whole army into the city, and
they did slay every one who did oppose them, inso-
much that they did take possession of the whole city.
And it came to pass that Pacumeni, who was the chief
judge, did flee before Coriantumr, even to the walls of
the city. -Andit came to pass that Coriantumr did
smite him against the wall, insomuch that he died..
And thus ended the days of Pacumeni. And now
when Coriantumr saw that he was in possession of the
ity of Zarahemla, and saw that the Nephites had fled
before them, and were slain, and were taken, and were
east into prison; and that. hehad obtained the posses-
sion of the strongest hold in all the land, his heart took
courage, insomuch that he was about to go forth
against all the land. And now he did not tarry in the

' land of Zarahemla, but he did march forth with a large
army, even towards the city of Bountiful; for it wae
his determination to go forth and cut his way through
with the sword, that he might obtain the north parts
of the land; and supposin that their greatest strength
was in the center of the land, therefore he did march
forth, giving them no time to assemble themselves to-
gether, save it were in small bodies; and in this man-
ner they did fall upon them and cut them down to the
earth. But nohold, this march of Coriantumr through
the center of the land, gave Moronihah great adyan-
tage over them, notwithstanding'the preatness' of the
