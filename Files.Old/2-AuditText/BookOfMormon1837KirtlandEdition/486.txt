mies of the Nephites, bothin' their frontâ€™and: in theis
rear. And the robbers who were on the south, were
also cut off in their places of retreat. And all these
things were done by command of Gidgiddoni. And
there were many thousands who did yield themselves
ap prisoners unto the Nephites; and the remainder of
them were slain; and their leader, Zemnarihah, wag
taken, and hanged upon a tree, yea, even upon the
top thereof, until he was dead... And when they had
hanged him until he was dead, they did fall the tree to
the earth, and did ery with a loud voice, saying, may
