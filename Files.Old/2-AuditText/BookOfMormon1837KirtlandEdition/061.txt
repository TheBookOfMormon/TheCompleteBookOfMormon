iniquity; yea, in fine, all those who belong to the king-
dom of the devil, are they who need fear, and tremble,
and quake; they are those who must be brought low
in the dust; they are those who must be consumed as
stubble: and this is according to the words of the
prophet. And the time cometh speedily, that the

righteous must be led up as calves of the stall, and the
Holy One of Israel must reign in dominion, and might,
and power, and great glory. And he gathereth his
children from the four quarters of the earth; and
he numbereth his sheep, and they know him; and there
shall be one fold and one shepherd: and he shall feed
his sheep, and in him they shall find pasture. And
because of the righteousness of his people, satan has
no power; wherefore, he cannot be loosed for the
space of many years; for he hath no power over the
hearts of the people, for they dwell in righteousness,
and {the Holy One of Israel reigneth. And now be-
hold, I, Nephi, say unto you, that all these things
miust come according to the flesh, But, behold, all
nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, shall dwell
safely in the Holy One of Israel, if it so be that they
will repent.

And now I, Nephi, make an end; for I durst not
speak further as yet, concerning these things. Where-
fore, my brethren, I would that ye should consider
that the things which have been written upon the
plates of brass, are true; and they testify that a man
must be obedient to the commandments of God..
Wherefore, ye need not suppose that I and my father
are the only ones that have testified, and also taught
them. Wherefore, if ye shall be obedient to the com-
mandments, and endure to the end, ye shall be saved
at the last day. And thus itis. Amen.
