before the Lamanites, but did stand with bold.
nese against them, And it came to. pass that we did
contend with an army of thirty thousand, against an
army of fifly thousand. And it came to pass that we
did stand before them with such firmness, that they
did flee from before us. And it came to pass that
when they had fled, we did pursue them with our ar-
mies, and did meet them again, and did beat them;
nevertheless the strength of the Lord was not with us;
ea, we were left to ourselves, that the spirit of the

And behold they did harden their hearts against the
Lord their God. And it came to pass that after this
tenth year had passed away, making, in the whole,
three hundred and sixty years:from the coming of
Christ, the king of the Lamanites sent an epistle unto
