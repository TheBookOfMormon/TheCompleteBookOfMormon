turned. again: diligently unto their labors: and the
priest, not esteeming himself above -+his hearers; for
the preacher was no better than the hearer, neither
was the teacher any better than the learner: and thus
they were.all equal, and they did all labor, every man
according to his strength; and they did impart of their
substance every man according to that which he had,
to the poor, and the needy, and the sick, and the af-
flicted; and they did not wear costly apparel, yet the
were neat and comely: and thus they did establish
the affairs of the church: and thus they began to have
continual peace again, notwithstanding all their per-

and all manner of wickedness; nevertheless, the law
was put in force upon all those who did transgress It,
inasmuch as it were possible.

And it came to pass that by thus exercising the law
upon them, every man maifeciaty according to that
which he had done, they became more still, and durst
not commit any wickedness, if it were known;  there-
fore, there was much peace among the people of Ne-
phi, until the fifth year of the reign.of the judges..
And-it came to pass in the commencement of the fifth
