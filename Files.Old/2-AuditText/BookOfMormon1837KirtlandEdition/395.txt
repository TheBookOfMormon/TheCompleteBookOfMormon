And. now behold, I-have somewhat-to say concern-
ing the people of Ammon, who, in the begining, were
Lamanites; but by Ammon and his brethren, or rather
by the power and. word of God, they bad been convert:
ed unto the Lord; and they had been. brought down
into the land of Zarahemla, and had: ever since been
protected by the Nephites; and because of their oath,
they had been kept from taking up arms against their
brethren: for they had taken an oath, that they never
would shed blood more; and according to their oath,
they wouldâ€™ have perished; yea, they would have suf-
fered themselves.to have fallen into the hands of their
brethren, had it not been for the pity. and the exceed-

enemies; therefore they did assemble themselves: to-
gether at this time, ag many.as were able to take up
arms; and they called themselves Nephites;. and they.
entered into a covenant, to fight for the liberty of the
Nephites; yea, to protect the land. unto the laying
down of their.lives; yea, even they covenanted that
they never would give up their liberty, but.they would
fight in all cases to protect the Nephites and them-
selves from bondage. .

Now. behold, there were two thousand. of. those
young men who.entered into this covenant, .and took
their weapons of war to defend their country... And
