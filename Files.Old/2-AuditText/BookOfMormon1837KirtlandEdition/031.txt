made unto the house of Israel; wherefore, they are of
great worth unto the Gentiles.

And the angel of the Lord said unto me, thou hast
beheld that the book proceeded forth, from the mouth
of a Jew; and when it proceeded forth from the mouth
of a Jew, it contained the plainness of the gospel of
the Lord, of whom the twelve apostles bear record;
and they bear record according to the truth which is
in the Lamb of God; wherefore, these things go forth
from the Jews:in purity, unto the Gentiles, aconreae
to the truth which is in God; and after they go for
by the hand of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, from
the Jews unto the Gentiles, thou seest the foundation
of a great and abominable church, which is most abom-

taken away from the gospel of the Lamb, many parts
which are plain and most precious; and also many
covenants of the Lord have they taken away; and all

Lamb of God; because of these things which are taken
away out of the gospel of the Lamb, an exceedi
great many do stumble, yea, insomuch that satan hath
great power over them; nevertheless thou belholdest
that the Gentiles who have gone forth out of captivity,
and have been lifted up by the power of God above all
other nations upon the face of the land, which is
choice above all other lands, which is the land that the
Lord God hath covenanted with thy father, that his
seed should have, for the land of their inheritance, will
not utterly destroy the mixture of thy seed, which are
among thy brethren; neither will he suffer that the Gen-
tiles shall destroy the seed of thy brethren; neither will
