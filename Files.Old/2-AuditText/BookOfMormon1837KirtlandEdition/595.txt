have'beenwriting. For behold, they rejected all the
words of Ether} for he truly told thenv of: all things,
from the beginning of man; and that after the waters
had receded from off the face of this land, it became a
choice land above all other lands, a'chosen land of the

Lord; wherefore the Lord would have’that all men 

should serve him, who dwell upon the face thereof:
and that it was the place'of the New Jerusalem, which
should come down out of heaven, and the holy sane-
tuary of the Lord. Behold, Ether saw the days of
Christ, and he spake concerning a New Jerusalem up-
on this land; and he spake also concerning the house
of Israel, and the Jerusalem from whence Lehi should
come; after it should be destroyed, it should: be built
up again a holy city unto the Lord: wherefore: it
could not be a New Jerusalem, for it had been ina
time of old, but it should be built up again, and become
aholy city of the Lord: and it should be built up
unto:the house of Israel; and that a New Jerasalem
should be built up upon this land, unto the remnant
of the seed of Joseph, for whicly things there has’ been’
a type; for as Joseph: brought his father down into
the land of Egypt, even so he died there; wherefore
the Ford brought a remnant of the seed of Joseph out.
of the land of Jerusalem, that’ heimight be merciful
unto the seed of Joseph, that they should: perish: not,
even as he was merciful unto the father of Joseph,
that he should: perish not; wherefore the remnant of
the house of Joseph shall be built upor this lavid;. and
it shall be a land of their inheritance; and they’ shall
build'up'a' holy city unto the Lord, like unto'the Jerusa-
lem’of old; and they shall’ no more be confounded,
until the end come, when the earth shall: pass away.
And there'shall be a new heaven and anew earth; and
they shall be like unto the old, save the old: have pass-
ed away, and all things have become new. And then
eometh the New Jerusalem; and blessed are they who.
dwell therein; for it is they whose garments are white
through the blood of the Lamb; and they are they
who are numbered among the remnant of the seed of
Joseph, who were of the house of Israel. And: then
alsa cometh the Jerusalem of old; and the inhabitants
thereof, blessed are they, for they have been washed
in the bloodof the Lamb; and'they'are they who were
seattered and gathered in from the four quarters’ of the
eatth, and from the north countries, and are partakers
of the fulfilling of the covenant which-God made with
