the Jews, who were scattered upon.-all the face of the
earth, that the records of the prophets and of the
twelve apostles of the Lamb, are true.

And the angel spake unte me, saying, these last
records which thou hast seen among the Gentiles, shall
establish the truth of the first, which are of the twelve
apostles of the Lamb, and shall make known the plain
and precious things which have been taken away from
them; and shall make known to all kindreds, tongues
and people, that. the Lamb of God is the Son of the
eternal Father,.and the Savior of the world; and that.
all men must_come unto him, or they cannot be saved;
and they must come according to the words which
shall be established by the mouth of the Lamb: and
the words'of the Lamb shall be made known in the ree-

the house of Israel; and they shall be a blessed peo-
pleupon the promised land forever; they shall be no
more brought down into captivity; and the house of
Israelshall no more be confounded; and that great
pit which hath been digged for them, by that great
and abominable church, which was founded by the
devil and his children, that he might lead away the
souls of men down to hell; yea, that great pit which
hath been digged for the destruction of men, shall be
filled by those who digged it, unto their utter destruc-
tion, saith the Lamb of God; not the destruction of
the soul, save it be. the casting of it into that: hell
which hathâ€™no end; for behold, this. is according to
the captivity: of the devil, and algo according to the
