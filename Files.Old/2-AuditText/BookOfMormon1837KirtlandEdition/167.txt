mandments, and also the commandments of my father,
and have prospered, and have been kept from fulling
into the hands of your enemies, even so if ye shall
keep the commandments of my son, or the command-
ments of God, which shall be delivered unto you by
him, ye shallprosper in the land, and your enemies
shall have no power over you. But O my people, be-
ware lest there shall arise contentions among you, and
ye list to obay the evil spirit, which was spoken of by
my father Mosiah. For behold, there is a wo pro-
nounced upon him who listeth to obey that spirit; tor
if he listeth to obey him, and remaineth and dieth in
his sins, the same drinketh damnation to his own soul;
for hesreceiveth for his wages an everlasting punish-
ment; having transgressed the law of God, contrary to
his own knowledge. 1 say unto you, that there are
not any among you, except it be your little children,
that have not been taught concerning these things;
but what knoweth that ye are eternaliy indebted to
your heavenly Father, to render to-him all that you
have, and are, and also have been taught, concerning -
the records which contain the prophecies which have
been spoken by the holy prophets, even down to the
time our father Lehi left Jerusalem; and also, all that
has been spoken by our fathers, until now. And be-
hold, also, they spake that which was commanded
them ofthe Lord; therefore, they are just and true.

 And-now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after
ye have knowniand have been-taught all these things,
if ye should transgress, and go contrary to that which
has been spoken, that ye do withdraw yourselves from
the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in
you to guide you in wisdomâ€™s paths, that ye may be
blessed, prospered, and preserved. I say unto you,
that the man that do2th this; the same cometh out in
open rebellion against God; therefore he listeth to obey
the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all right-
eousness; therefore, the Lord has no place in him, for
he dwelleth not in'unholy temples. Therefore, if that
man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy
to God, the demands of divine justice doth awaken his
immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which
doth cause-him te shrink from the presence of the
Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and
anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose
flames ascendeth up forever and ever. And riow I say
