Lord hath commanded you that ye should go against
them. . See that ye strengthen: Lehi and Teancum in
the Lord: tell them to fear not, for God will deliver
them; yea, and ,also all. those who stand fast in that
liberty wherewith God hath made them free. And
now  close mine epistle to my beloved brother Mo-
roni.

CHAPTER XXIX.

_ Anp now it came to pass that when Moroni had re-
ceived this epistle, his heart did take courage, and, was
filled with exceeding great joy, because of the faithful-

session-of the land.

down. with their armies into the land of .Zarahemla,
and went forth against the city, and did meetthe men
of Pachusg, insomuch, that, they: did.come to,-battle.
