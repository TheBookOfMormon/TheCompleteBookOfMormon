ry, that they are his words, at.the last day; and you
and I shall stand face to face before his bar; and ye shall
know that I have been commanded of him to write these
things, notwithstanding my weakness: and I pray the
Father in the name of Chnist, that many of us, if not
all, may be saved in his kingdom, at that great and
last day.

of the house of Israel, and all ye ends of the earth, I
speak unto you, as the voice of one erying from the
dust: farewell until that great day shall come; atid
you that will not partake of the goodness of God, and
respect the words of the Jews, and also my words,
and the words which shall proceed forth out of the
mouth of the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you an ever-
lasting farewell, tor these words shall condemn you at
the last day: for what I seal on earth, shall be brought
against you at the judgment bar; for thus hath the
Lord commanded me, and I must obey. Anten.
