And king Mosiah did cause his people that they
should till the earth. And healso, himself did till the
earth, that thereby he might not become burthensome
to his people, that he might do according to that
which his father had done, in all things. And there
was no contention among all his people, for the space
of three years. ,

CHAPTER ¥.

Axp now, it came to pass that afler king Mosiah
had had continual peace, for the space of three years,
he was desirous to know concerning the people who
went up to dwell in the land of Lehi-Nephi, or in the
city of Lehi-Nephi: for his people had heard nothing
from them, from the time they left the land of Zara-
hemla; therefore, they wearied him with their teas-
ings.

and it came to pass that king Mosiah granted that
sixteen of their strong men might go up to the land
of Lehi-Nephi, to inquire concerning their brethren.
And it came to pass that on the morrow, they started
to go up, having with them one Ammon, he being a
strong and mighty man, and a descendant of Zara-
hemla; and he was also their leader. And now, they
knew not the course they should travel in the wilder.
ness, to go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi; therefore,
they wandered many days in the wilderness, eve for-
ty days did they wander. And when they had war-
dered forty days, they came toa hill, which is north
of the land of Shilom, and there they pitched their
tents. And Ammon took three of his brethren, and
their names were Amaleki, Helem, and Hem, and
they went down into the land of Nephi; and behold,
they met the king of the people, who was in the land
of Nephi, and in the land of Shilom; and they were
surrounded by the king’s guard, and were taken, and
were bound, and were committed to prison. And it
came to pass when they had been in prison two days,
they were again brought before the king, and their
bands were loosed; and they stood before the king,
and were permitted, or rather: commanded that oe

should answer the questions which he should as.
