done as my father dwelt ina tent, in the valley of

Lemuel. ;
And it came to pasr after I, Nephi, having heard all

the words of my father, concerning the mine which
he saw in a vision; and also the things which he spake
by the power of the Holy Ghost; which power he re-
ceived by faith on the Son of God; and the Son of God
was the Messiah, who should come. I, Nephi, was de-
sirous also, that I might see, and hear, and know of
these things, by the power of the Holy Ghost, which

desire to behold the things which my father saw. And
the spirit said unto me, believest thou that thy father
saw the tree ot which he hath spoken? And I said
