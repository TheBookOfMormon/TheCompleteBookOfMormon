the earth goeth back, and it appeareth unto man that
the sun standeth still; yea, and behold, this is su; for
sure it is the earth that meyeth, and not the sun. And
behold, also, if he say unto $he waters of the great
dep, be thou dried up; it-1s done. Behold, if he
sy unto this mountain, be thou raised up, and come
sver and fall upon that city, that it be buried up,
behold it is done. And behold, if aman hide upa
treasure in the earth, and-the Lord shall say, let it be
accursed, because of the iniquity of him who hath hid
it up, behold, it shall be accursed; and if the Lord
shall say, be thou accursed, that no man shall find thee
from this time henceforth and ,forever, behold, no
man getteth it henceforth and forever, And behold if
the Lord shall say unto a man, because of thine iniqui-
ties thou shalt be acursed forever, it shall be done..
And ifthe Lord shall say, because of thine iniquities,
thou shalt be cut off. from my presence, he will cause
that it shall’ be so. And wounto him to whom he
shall say this, for it shall be unto him that will do ini-
quity, and he cannot be saved; therefore, for this.
cause, that men might be’saved, hath repentance been
declared. Therefore, blessed are they who will.repent
and hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; for
these are they \hat shall be saved. .And may God
grant,,in his great fulness, that men might be brought
unto repentance and good works, that they might be
restored unto grace, for grace according totheir works.
And I would that all men might be saved. But we
read that in that great and last day, there- are some
who shall be cast out; yea, who shall be cast off from
the presence of the Lord; yea, who shall be consign-
ed toa state ot endless misery, fulfilling the words
which say, they that have done good, shall have ev-
erlasting life; andthey that have done evil, shall have
everlasting damnation. And thus it is. Amen.
