that the Lord-had granted unto them according to their
prayers, and that he had also verified his: word unto
them in every particular. And now; these are: the
words of Ammon to his brethren, which say thus:
My brothers and my brethren; behold I say unto you,
how great reason have we to: rejoice; for could we
have supposed, when we started from the land of Za-
rahemla, that God would have granted unto us such
reat blessings? And now  ask, what great blessings
as he bestowed upon us? Can ye tell? Behold, I
answer for you, for our brethren, the Lamanites, were
in.darkness, yea, even in the darkest abyss; but be-
