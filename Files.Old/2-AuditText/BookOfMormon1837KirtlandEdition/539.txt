when ye shall see these sayings coming forth among
you, then ye need not any longer spurn at the doings
of the Lord, for the sword of his justice is in his right
hand, and behold at that day, if ye shall spurn at his
doings, he will cause that it shall soon overtake you.
Wo unto him that spurneth at the doings of the Lord;
yea, wo unto him that shall aeny the Christ and his
works; yea, wo unto him that shall deny the revela-
tions of the Lord, and that shall say, the Lord no
longer worketh by revelation, or by prophecy, or by
gifls, or by tongues, or by healings, or by the power
of the Holy Ghost; yea, and wo unto him that shall
say at that day, that there can be no miracle wrought
by Jesus Christ, to get gain; for he that doeth this,
shall become like unto the son of perdition, for whom
there was no mercy, according to the word of Christ.
Yea, and ye need not any longer hiss, nor spurn, nor
make game of the Jews, nor any of the remnant of the
house of Israel, for behold the Lord remembereth his
covenant unto them, and he will do unto them accor-
ding to that which he hath sworn; therefore ye need
not suppose that ye can turn the right hand of the
Lord unto the left, that he may not execute judgment
unto the fulfilling of the covenant which he hath made
unto the house of Israel.

may receive a remission of your sins, and be filled
With the Holy. Ghost, that ye may be numbered with
my: people, wioare of the house of Israel.
