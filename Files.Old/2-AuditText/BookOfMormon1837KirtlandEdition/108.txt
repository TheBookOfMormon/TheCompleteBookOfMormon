ner of prophesying among the Jews. For I, Nephi,
have not taught them many things concerning the
manner of the Jews; for their works were works: of
darkness, and their doings were doings of abomina-
tions. Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all
those that shall receive hereafter these things which fT
write, that they may know the judgments of God,
that they come upon all nations, according to the
word which he hath spoken.. Wherefore hearken, 0:
my people, which are of the house of Israel, and give
ear unto my words: for because the words of Fsaiah
are not plain unto you, nevertheless they are plain un-
to all those that are filled with the spirit of prophecy.
But I give unto you a prophecy, according to the spir-
it which is in me; wherefore I shall prophesy accord-

nevertheless, in the days that the prophecies of Isaiah
shall be fulfilled, men shall know of a surety, at the
times when they shall eome to pass; wherefore, they
are of worth unto the children of men, and he that
supposeth that they are not, unto them will I speak
particularly, and confine the’ words unto’ mine own
people: for I know that they shall be of great warth
unto them in the last days; for in that day shall the

understand them; .wherefore, for their gaod have
