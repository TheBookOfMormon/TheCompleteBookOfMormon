stroy them.-.And they fled eight: daysâ€™ journey into
the wilderness, . And they cametoia land, yea, even:
a very. beautifiland. pleasant land; :ailand of pure
water. And they. pitched -their. tents, and: began. to
till the..ground, and: began. to build, buildings, &c.;

And the people were desirous that. Alma should be
their king, for he was beloved by his.people.. But he
said'unto them, behold, it.is not, expedient that we
should have a-king; for.thus saith, the Lord: Ye
shall not esteem one flesh.above another; er one man
shall-not think himself above another;. therefore I say
unto you, it is not expedient that ye should havea
king. - Nevertheless, if it were possible that.ye could
always have just men to be-your kings, it would
be well for you to have a king. But remember the
iniquity of king Noah and his priests: and. I-myself

his people, and also from.the bonds of iniquity, even

wherewith ye have been made free, and that ye trust
no man to bea king over you; andalso trusting no one
to be your teacher nor your minister, except he be a
man of God, wa!king.in his ways and keeping his
eommandments. Thus. did Alma teach his people,
that every man should love his neighbor as himself:
that there should be no contention among them. And
now Alma was their high priest, he being the founder
of their church. And it came to.pass that none re-
ceived authority to preach orto: teach, except it. were
by him from God, Therefore he consecrated all their
priests, and. all. their. deachers, .and- none: were. con-
