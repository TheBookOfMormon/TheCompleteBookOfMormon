therefore the spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from
you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all
power over you; and this is the final state of the wick-
ed. And this I know, because the Lord hath'said, he
dwelleth not in unholy temples, but in the hearts of
the righteous doth hedwell; yea, and hehas also said,
that the righteous shall sit down in his kingdom, to go
no more out; but their garments should be made white,
through the blood of the Lamb.

And now my beloved brethren, 1 desire that ye
should remember these things, and that ye should
work out your salvation with fear before God, and that
ye should no more deny the coming of Christ; that ye
contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye
receive it, and take upon you the name of Christ;
that ye humble yourselves even to the dust, and wor-
ship God in whatsoever place ye, may be in, in spirit
and in truth; and that ye live in thanksgiving daily,
for the many mercies and blessings which he doth be-
stow upon you; yea, and I also exhort you, my breth-
ren, that ye be watchful unto prayer continually, that
ye may not be led away by the temptation of the dev-
il, that he may not overpower you, that ye may not
become his subjects at the last day: for behold, he re-
wardeth you no good thing. And now.my beloved
brethren, I would exhort you to have patience, and
that ye bear with all manner of afflictions; that ye do
not revile against those who-do cast you out because
of your exceeding poverty, lest ye become sinners like
unto them; but that ye have patience, and bear with
those afflictions, with a firm hope that ye shall one
day rest from all your afflictions.

end of these words, they withdrew themselves from
the multitude, and came over into the land of Jershon;
yea, and the rest of the brethren, after they had
preached the word unto the Zoramites, also came over
into the land of Jershon.

And it came to pass that after the more popular part
of the Zoramites had consulted together concerning
the words which had been preached unto them, they
were angry because of the svord, for it-did destroy
their craft; therefore they would not hearken unto the
words. And they sent and gathered together through
outâ€™ all the: land, all. the people; and consulted with
them-eoncerning the words: which: had been spoken.
