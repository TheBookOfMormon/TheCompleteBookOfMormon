persist in your wickedness, that your days shall not be
prolonged in the land, for the Lamanites shall be sent
upon you; and if ye repent not, they shall come ina
time when you know not, and ye shall be visited with
utterdestruction; and it shall be according to the fierce
anger of the Lord; for he will not suffer you that ye
