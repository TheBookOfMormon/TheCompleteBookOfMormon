that except ye repent, they shall poxsess the land of
your inheritance, and the Lord’ God will lead away
the righteous out from arnong you. Behold, the La-
manites your brethren, whom ye hate, because of their
fillhiness and the cursings which hath come upon
their skins, are more righteous’ than you; for they
have not forgotten the commandment of the Lord,
which was given unto our fathers, that they should
have, save if were one wife; and concubines they
should have none; and there should net be whoredoms
committed among them. And now this command-
ment they observe to keep; wherefore, because of this
observance in keeping this commandment, the Lord
God wiil not destroy them, but will be merciful unto
them; and one day they sha}l become a blessed people.
Behold, their husbands love their wives, and their

remember that ye may, because of your filthiness,
bring your children unto destruction, and their sins be
heaped upon your heads at the last day.

O my brethren, hearken. unto my word; arouse the
faculties ef your soul; shake yourselves, that ye may
awake from the slumber of death; and loose yourselves
from the pains of hell, that ye may not become angels
to the devil, to be cast into that lake offire and brim:
stone, which is tae second death. And now J, Jacob,
spake many more.things unto the people of Nephi,
wanitg them against tornieation, aad lasciviousuess,
and every kiad of sim, telling them the awful copse-
