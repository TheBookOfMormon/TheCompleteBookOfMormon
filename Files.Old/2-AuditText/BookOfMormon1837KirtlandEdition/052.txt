make these plates; wherefore, the record of my fath-
er, and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part
of all our proceedings in the wilderness, are engraven
upon those plates of which I have spoken; wherefore,
the things which transpired before I made these plates,
are, of a truth, more particularly made mention upon
the first plates.

And after I had made these plates by way of com-
mandment, I, Nephi, received a commandment, that
the ministry, and the prophecies, the more plain and
precious parts of them should be written upon these
plates; and that the things which were written, should
be kept for the instruction of my people, who should
possess the land, and also for other wise purposes,
which purposes, are known unto the Lord; wherefore,
I, Nephi, did make a record upon the other plates,
which gives an account, or which gives a greater ac-
count of the wars, and contentions, and destructions
ofmy people. And this have I done, and commanded
my people what they should do, after I was gone, and
that these plates should be handed down from one pen

until further commandments of the Lord. And an
account of my making these plates shall be given
hereafter; and then, behold, I proceed according to
that which I have spoken; and this I do, that the
more sacred things may be kept for the knowledge of
my people. Nevertheless, I do not write any thing
upon plates, save it be that I think it be sacred..

which some men esteem to be of great worth, both to
the body and soul, others set at nought, and trample
under their feet. Yea, even the very God of Israel, do
men trample under their feet; I say, trample under
their feet; but I would speak in other words: They
set him at nought, and hearken not to the voice of
his counsels; and behold, he cometh according to
the words of the angel, in six hundred years ees
the time my father left Jerusalem. And the world,
because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a
thing of nought; wherefore, they scourge him, and
he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth
it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, be-
cause of his loving kindness and his longâ€™ suffering to-
