shall stand as a testimony against the world, at the
last day... And if itso be that they repent and come
unto the Father in the name of Jesus, they shall be re-
ceived into tlie kingdom of God. , And now, if I have
no authority for these things, judge ye, fer ye shall
know that I have authority when ye shall see me, and
we snall stand before God at the last day. Amen,
