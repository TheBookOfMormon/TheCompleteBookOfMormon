gressed, he would not have fallen; but he would have
remained in the garden of Eden. And all things
which were created, must have remained in the same
state which they were, after they were created; and
they must have remained forever, and had'no end. And
they would have had no children; wherefore, they
would have remained in a state of innocence, having
no joy, for they knew no misery: doing no good, for
they knew no sin. But beheld, all things have been
done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things..
Adam fell, that men might be; and men are, that they
might have joy. And the Messiah cometh in the fual-
ness of time, that he may redeem the children of men
from the fall. And because that they are redeemed
from the fall, they have become free forever, knowing
good from evil; to act for themselves, and not to be
acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law,
at the great and last day, according to the command-
ments which God hath given. Wherefore, men are
free according to the flesh; and all things are given
them which are expedient unto man. And they are
free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the
great mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and

eath, according to the captivity and power of the
devil: for he seeketh that all men might be miserable
like unto himself.

And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to
the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great com-
mandments; and be faithful unto his words, and
choose eternal life, according to the will of his Holy
Spirit, and not choose eternal death, according to the
will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which
giveth the spirit of the devil: power to captivate, to
bring you down to hell, that he-may reign over you in
his own kingdom,

Ihave spoken these few words unto you all, my
sons, in the last days of my probation; and I have
chosen the good part, according tothe words of the
prophet: And J have none other object, save it be the
everlasting welfare of your souls. Amen.
