to the great astonishment of all the people; and the
knowledge of this went forth throughout all the land
of Sidom. And Alma baptized Zeezrom unto the Lord;
and he began from that time forth to preach unto the
people. And Alma established a church in the land
of Sidom, and consecrated priests and teachers in the
land, to baptize unto the Lordâ€™ whosoever were desir-
ous to be baptized.

And it came to pass that they were many; for they
did flock in from all:the region round about Sidom,
and were baptized; but as to the people that were in the
land of Ammonihah, theyyet remained:a hard hearted
and a stiffnecked people; and they repented not of
their sins, ascribing all the power of Alma and Amu-
lek to the devil: for they were of the profession of
Nehor, and did not believe in the repentance of their
sins.

And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek, Amu-
lek having forsaken all his gold, and silver, and his
precious things, which were in the land of Ammoni-
hah, for the word of God, he being rejected by those
who were once his friends, and also by his father and
his kindred; therefore, after Alina having established
the church at Sidom, seeing a great check, yea, seeing
that the people were checked as t the pride of their
hearts, and began to humble themselves before God,
and began to assemble themselves together at their
sanctyaris to worship God before the altar, watching
and praying continually, that they might be delivered
from satan, and from death, and from destruction;
Now as I said, Alma having seen all these things,
therefore he took Amulek and came over to the land
of Zarahemla, and took him to his own house, and did
administer unto him in his tribulations, and strength-
ened him in the Lord. And thus ended the tenth year
of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
