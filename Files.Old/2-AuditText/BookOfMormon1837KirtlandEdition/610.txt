joiceth in thetruth, beareth all thinge,: believeth all
things, hopeth all things, endureth all things; where-
fore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye
are nothing, for charity: never. faileth.; Wherefore,
cleave unto charity, which isthe greatest of all, for all
things must fail; but charity is the pure love of Christ
and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed
of it at the last day, it shall be well with them.
Wherefore, my beloved. brethren, pray unto the Father
with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with
this love which he hath bestowed upon all who are
true followers of his Son Jesus Chriat, that ye may be-
come the sons of God, that when he shall appear, we
shall be like him; for we shall-see him as he is, that
we may have this hope, that we may be purified even
ashe is pure. Amen.
