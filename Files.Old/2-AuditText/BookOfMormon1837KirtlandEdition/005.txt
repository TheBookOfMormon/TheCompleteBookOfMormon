io the account of Nephi; or, in other words, I Nephi
wrote this record.

I, Neput, having been born of goodly parents, there-
fore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my
father; and have seen many afflictions in the course
of my days.nevertheless, having been highly favored
of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great
knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God,
therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my
days; yea, 1 make a record in the language of my
father, which consists of the learning of the Jews and
the language of the Egyptians. And I know that the
record which I make is true; and I make it with mine

own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.
For it came to.pass, in the commencement of the

first year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah,
(my father Lehi having dwelt.at Jerusalem in all his
days;) andin'that same year there came many proph-
ets, prophesying unto the people, that they must re-
pent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.
