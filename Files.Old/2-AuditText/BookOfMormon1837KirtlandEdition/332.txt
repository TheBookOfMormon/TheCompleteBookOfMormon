compare the wordâ€™unto a.seed. Now.if ye give place,
that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it
be a 4rue seed, or a good.seed, if. ye do not cast it out
by your-unbelief, that ye will resist the spirit.of the
Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts;
and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will be-
gin to say .within yourselves, if must. needs be that
this is a -good seed, or that the word is. good, for it be-
ginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to en-
lighten my understanding; yea, and it beginneth to be
delicious tome. Now behold, would not this increase
your faith?. I say unto you, yea; nevertheless it hath
not grown up to a perfect knowledge. But behold, as
the seed .swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to
grow, then ye must needs say, that the seed is good;
for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to
grow. And now behold, are ye sure that this is a good

begin to expand... O then,:is not this real? I.say un-

Behold, Tsay, unto-you, nay: neither must ye lay aside
your faith, for ye. have only exercised. your faith to
plant the. seed, that ye:might try. the experiment, to

and bring forth fruit unto,us. And now behold, if ye

and, take no thought: for its nourishment, behold, it
