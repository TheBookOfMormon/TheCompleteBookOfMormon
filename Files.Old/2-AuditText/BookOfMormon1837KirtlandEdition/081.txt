that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon? Art

great deep; that hath made the depths of the scaa
way for the ransomed to pass over! Therefore, the
redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with
singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy and holiness
shall be upon their heads; and they sball obtain glad-
ness and joy: sorrow and mourning shall flee away.
Iam he; yea, I am he that comforteth you: Behold,
who art thou, that thou_shouldest be afraid of man,
who shall die, and of the Son of man, who shall be
