all the land, among all the people of Nephi;. yea, the
cry of widows mourning for their husbands, and also of
fathers mourning for their sons, and the daughter for
the brother; yea, the brother for the father: and thus
the cry of mourning was heard among every one of
them: mourning for their kindred who had been slain.
And now surelythis was a sorrowful day; yea, a time
of solemnity, and a time of much fasting and prayer:
and thus endeth the fifteenth year of the reign of the
judges over the people-of Nephi; and this is the ac-
count of Arnmon and his brethren, their journeyings
in the land of Nephi, their sufferings in the land, their
sorrows, and their afflictions, and their incomprehen-
sible joy, and the reception and safety of the brethren
in the land of Jershon. And now may the Lord, the
Redeemer of all men, bless their-souls forever. And
this is the account of the wars and contentions among
the Nephites, and also the wars between the Nephites
and the Lamanites; and the fifteenth year of the reign
of the judges is ended; and from the first year to the
fifteenth, has brought to pass the destruction of many
thousand Jives; yea, it has brought to pass an awful
scene of bloodshed; and the bodies of many thousands
are laid low in the earth, while the bodies of many
thousands are mouldering in heaps upon the face of
the earth; yea, and many thousands are mourning for
the loss of their kindred, because they have reason to
fear, according to the promises of the Lord, that they
are consigned to a state of endless wo; while many
thousands of others truly mourn for the loss of their
kindred, yet they rejoice and exult in the hope, and
even know, according to the promises of the Lord,
that they are raised to dwell at the right hand of God,
in.a state of never ending happiness: and thus we see
how great the inequality of man is because of sin and
transgression, and the power of the devil, which comes
by the cunning plang which he hath devised to en-
snare the hearts of men; and. thus we see the great
eall of diligence of men to labor in the vineyards of the
Lord; and thus we see the great reason of sorrow, and
also of rejoicing: sorrow because of:death and destruc-
tion among men, and joy because of the light of Christ
unto life. O that I'were an angel,.and could have the
wish of mine heart, that. I. might go forth and speak
with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth,
and cry repentance untovevery people; yea, .1-would
declare unto every soul; as with the voice of thunder,
