heed unto his word, and they were zealous for keep-
ing the commandments of God. Now as Ammon was
thus teaching the people of Lamoni continually, we
will return to the account of Aaron and his brethren;
for after he departed from the land of Middoni, he was
led by the spirit to the land of Nephi; even to the
house of the king which was over all the land, save it
were the land of Ishmael; and he was the father of
Lamoni.

And it came to pass that he went in unto him into
the kingâ€™s palace, with his brethren, and bowed him-

And now when Aaron heard this, his. heart began
to rejoice, and he said, behold, assuredly, as thou liv-
