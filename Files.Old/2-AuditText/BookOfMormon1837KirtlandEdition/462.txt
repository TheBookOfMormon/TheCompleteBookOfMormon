goodness, doth bless and prosper those who put their
trust in him; yea, and we may see at the very time
when he doth prosper his people; yea, in the increaga
of their fields, ,their flocks, and their herds, and in
gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious things
of every kind, and art; sparing their lives, and deliv.
ering them out of the hands of their enemies; soften.
ing the hearts of their.enemies, that they should not
declare wars against them; -yea, and in fine, doing alt
things for the welfare’ and happiness of his people;
yea, then is the time that they do harden their hearts,
and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample un-
der their feet the Holy One; yea, and this because of
their ease, and their exceeding great prosperity. And
thus we see, that except the Lord doth ehasten his
people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit
them with death, and with terror, and with famine,
and with all manner of -pestilences, they will not re-
member.him. O how foolish, and how vain, and how
evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and
how slow to do good, are the children of mien; yea,
hew quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one,
and to’ set their hearts upon the vain things of the
world; yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea,
how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which
is iniquity;. and how slow are they to remember the
Lord their God, and to give ear unto his counsels;
yea, how slow to walk in wisdom’s paths! -Behold,
they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath
created them, should rule and reign over ther, not-
withstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards
them; they do set-at nought his counsels, and they
will not that he should be their guide. O how great
is the nothingness of the e):ildren of men; yea, even
they are less than the dust of the earth. For behold,
the dust of the earth moyeth hither and thither, to the
dividing asunder, at the command of our great and ev-
erlasting God; yea, behold, at,his voice-doth the hills
and theymountains trembleand quake; and by the pow-
er of his voice they are broken up, and become smooth,
yea, even like unto,avalley; yea, by the power of his
voice doth the whole earth shake; yea, by the power
of his voice, doth the .foundations rock, even to the
very center; yea, and if he say unto the earth, move,
itis moved; yea, if he.say unto.the earth, thoo
shalt go back, that it lengthen out the.day.. for man

hours, it is done; and thus: according to: his wor
