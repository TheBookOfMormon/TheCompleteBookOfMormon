ple; yea, all their murders, and robbings, and their
plunderings, and all. their wickedness, and abomina-
tions, may be made manifest unto this people; yea;
and that ye preserve these directors. For behold, the 
Lord saw that his people began to work in darkness;
yea, work secret inurders ant abominations; therefore
the Lord said, if they did not repent, they should be
destroyed from oif the face of the earth. And the
Lord said, 1 will prepare unto my servant Gazelem, a
stone, which shall shine forth in darkness unto light,
that I may discover unto my people wio serve me,
that I may discover unto them the works of their
brethren; yea, the:r secret works, their works of dark-
ness, and their wickedness and abominations, And
now my son, these directors were prepared, that the
word of God might be fulfilled, which he spake, say-
ing: I will bring forth out of darxness unto Hight, all
their seeret works and their abominations: and except
they repent, [ will destroy them from off the face of
the earth; and IL will bring to light all their secrets
and abominations, unto every nation that shail here:
afler possess the land. And now my sen, we see that
they did not repent: therefore they have been destroy-
ed, and thus far the word of God has been fulfilled;
yea, their secret abominations have been brought out
of darkness, and made known unto us.

And now my son, I command you that ye retain all
their oaths, and their covenants, and their agreements
in their secret abominations; yea, and all their signs
and their wonders ye shall retain from this people,
that they know them not, lest peradventure they
should fxil into darkness also, and be destroyed. For
behold, there is a curse upon aH this land, that des-
truction shall come upon all those workers of dark-
ness, according to. the.pewer of Ged, when they are
fully ripe; therefore I desire that this people: might
not be destroyed. Therefore-ye sha!l keep these se-
cret plans oftheir oaths and them covenants from this
people, and only their wickedness, and their murders;
and their abominations,’ shall ye make known unto
them: and ye shall.teach them-to abhor such wicked: .
ness; and abominations, and murders; and-we shall al-
so teach them, that these people were’ destroyed on
account-of their wickedness, and abominations, and
their murders: For behold, they murdered’ all the
prophets ofthe Lord who came among them to de-
clare unto’ them concerning’ their iniquities;’ and the
