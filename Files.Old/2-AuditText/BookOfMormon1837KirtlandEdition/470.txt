height thereof is great. And many highways shall be
broken up, and many cities shall become desolate, and
many graves shall be opened,.and shall yield up many
of.their dead; and many saints.shall appear.unto ma
ny. And behold thus hath the angel spoken unto me;
for he said unto me, that there should be thunderings
and lightnings for the space of many hours; and he
said urito me that while the thunder and the lightning
lasted, and the tempest, that these things should be,

earth, for the space of three days. And the angel said
