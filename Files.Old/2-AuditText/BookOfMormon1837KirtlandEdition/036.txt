purity, according to the truth which is in the Lamb, in
the own due time of the Lord,. unto the house of Is-
rael.

And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the name
of the apostle of the Lamb was Juhn, according to the

true. And thus itis. Amen.

And it came to pass that after I had received strength,
