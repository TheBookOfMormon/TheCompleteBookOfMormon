the Nephites andthe Lamanites, in’ the eighteenth
year of the reign of the judges, For belrold; it came
to pass thatthe Zoramites became Larnmanites; there-
fore in the commencement of the eighteenth year, the
people of the Nephites: saw that the Lamanites were
coming upon them; therefore they made preparations
for war; yea, they gathered together their armies in
the land of Jershon. And it came to pags that the La-
manites came with their thousands; and they came
into the land of Antionum, which was the land of the
Zoramites; and'a man by the name of Zerahemnah
was their leader. And now as the Amalekites were of
amore wicked and a murderous disposition than the
Lamanites were; in and of themselves, therefore Zera-
hemnah appointed chief captains over the Lamanites,
and they were all the Amalekites and the Zoramites.
Now this he did; that-he might preserve their hatred
towards the Nephites; thathe might bring them. into
subjection, to the-accomplishment of his designs; for
behold, his designs were to stir up the. Lamanites to
anger against the Nephites; this he did that he might
usurp great power over them; and also that he might
gain power over the Nephites, by bringing them into
bondage, &c. And now the’ design of the Nephites
was to support their lands, and their houses, and their
wives, and their children, that: they might preserve
them from the hands of their enemies; and ajso, that
they might preserve their rights and their privileges;
yea, and also their liberty, that they might worship
{zod according to their desires} for they knew that
if they should fall into the hands of the Lamanites, that
whosoever should worship God, in spirit and in trath,
tae true and the living God, the Lamanites would de-
soy; yea, and they also-knew the extreme hatred of
the Lamanites towards their brethren, who were the
people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi; who were called the peo-
ple of Ammon; and they would not take up arms; yea,
they had entered into a covenant, and they-would not
break it; therefore, if they should fall into the hands
of the Lamanites, they would be destroyed. And the
Nephites would not suffer that they should be destroy-
ed; therefore they gave them lands for their inherit-
ance. And. the people of Ammon: did give unto the
Nephites a large portion of their.substance, to support
their armies; and thus-the Nephites were compelled,
alone, to withstand againstthe: Lamanites, who were
a compound of Laman and, Lemuel;and the sons of
