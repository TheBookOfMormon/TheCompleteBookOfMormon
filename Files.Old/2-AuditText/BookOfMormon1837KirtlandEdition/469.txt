believe on his name, ye will repent of all.your sins,
that thereby ye may have a, remission of them through
his merits. And behold, again another sign I give un-
to you; yea, a sign of his death; for behold, he surely
must die, that salvation may come; yea, it behooveth
him, and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring
to pass the resurrection of the dead, that thereby men

may be brought into the presence of the Lord; yea,

behold this death bringeth to pass the resurrection, and
redeemeth all mankind from the first death; that spir-
itual death for all mankind, by the fall of Adam, being
cut off from the presence of the Lord, or considered as
dead, both as to things temporal and to things spiritu-
al. But behold} the resurrection of Christ redeemeth
mankind, yea, ever all mankind, and bringeth them
back into the presence of the Lord; yea, and it bring-
eth to'pass the condition of repentance, that whosoey-
er repenteth, the same is not-hewn dewn and cast into
the fire; but whosoever repenteth not, is hewn down
aud-cast into the fire, and there cometh upon them
again a spiritual death, yea,a second death, for they
are-cut off again as to things pertaining to righteous-
ness; therefore repent ye; repent ye, lest by knowing
these things and not doing them, ye shall suffer your-
selves to come under condemnation, and ye are brought
down unto this second death. But. behold, as I said
unto you concerning another sign, a sign of his death,

behold, in that day that he shall suffer death, the sun

shall be darkened and refuse to give his light unto
you; and also the moon, and the stars; and there shall
be no light upon the face of this land, even from the
time that he shall suffer death, for the space of three
days, tothe time that he shall rise again from the

dead; yea, at the time that he shall yield up the ghost, .
there shall be thunderings and hghtnings for the space

of many hours; and the earth shall shake and tremble,

and the rocks which are upon the face of this.earth,

Which are both above the earth and beneath, which ye
know at this time are solid, or the more part of it is

one solid mass,.shall be broken up; yea, they shall be
rent in twain, and sball ever after be found in.seams
and in cracks, and in broken fragments upon the face

ofthe whole earth; yea, both above the earth and be-

neath, And behald there shall be great tempests, and
there'shall be: many mountains laid. low, like. unto a

valley,-and thereshall be many places, which are now

salled valleys, which shall become mountains, whose
