BOOK OF ETHER:
CHAPTER I.

Axp.now I, Moroni,â€™ proceed to give an account of
those. ancient inhabitants who were destroyed by the
hand of the Lord upon the face ofthis north country.
And.I take mine account from the twenty and fou
plates which were found by the people of Limhi, which
is called the book of Ether. And as I suppose that
the first. part of this record, which speaks. concerning
the creation of the world, and also.of Adam, and an
account from that time even to the great tower, and
whatsoever things transpired among the children of
men until that time, is had among the Jews, therefore
I do not write those things which transpired from the
days of Adam until that time; but they are had upon
the plates; and whoso findeth them, the same will
have power that he may get the full account. But be-
hold, I give not the full account, but a part of the ac-
count  give, from the: tower down until they were
destroyed. Andon this wise do I give the account..
