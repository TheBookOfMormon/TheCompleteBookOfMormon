lici; he being a very cunning man, yea, a wise man,
as to the wisdom of the world; he being after the or-

der of the man that slew-Gideon by the sword, who
was executed according to the law. Now this Amli-
ci had, by his cunning, drawn away much people after
him; even so much that they began to be very power-
ful; and they began to endeavor to establish Amlici to
be a king over the people. Now this was alarming to
the people of the church, and also to all those who
had not been drawn away after the persuasions of Am-
lici: for they knew that according to their law that
such things must be established by the voice of the
people; therefore, if it were possible that Amlici should
gain the voice of the people, he being a wicked man,

would deprive them of their rights and privileges of
the church, &c: for it was his intent to destroy the
charch of God. 

And it came to pasg that the people assembled them-
selves together throughout all the land, every man ac-

of the people came against Amlici, that he was not
made king over the people. Now this did cause much

And it came to pass that they gathered themselves
together, and did consecrate Amlici to be their king.
Now when Amlici was made king over them, he com-
manded them that they should take up arms against
their brethren; and this he did, that he might subject
themtohim. Now the people of Amlici were distin-
guished by the name of Amlici, being called Amlicites;
and the remainder were called Nephites, or the people of
God: therefore the people of the Nephites were aware
of the intent of the Amlicites, and therefore they did
prepare to meet them; yea, they did arm themselves
with swords, and with cimeters, and with bows, and
with arrows, and with stones, and with slings, and
with all manner of weapons of war, of every kind;
and thus they’ were prepared to meet the Amlicites at
the time of their coming. © And there were appointed
