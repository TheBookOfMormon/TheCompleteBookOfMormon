leave the strength and the blessings of God upon
them, that none other power can operate against
them; and this because of their exceeding faith and
their patience in their tribulations; and J will come
unto you, and if there be any among you: that hasa
desire for freedom, yea, if there be even a spark of
freedom remaining, behold I will stir up insurrections
among you, even until those who have desires to
usurp power and authority, shall become extinct; yea,
behold I do wot fear your power nor your authority,
but it is my God whom.I fear, and it is according to
his commandments that I do take my sword to defend
the cause of my country, and it is because of your in-
iquity that we have suffered so much loss. Behold it
is time; yea, the time is now at hand, that except ye
do bestir yourselves in the defence of your country
and your little ones, the sword of justice doth hang
over you; yea, and it shall fall upon you and visit you
evento your ulter destruction, Behold, I wait for
assistance from you, and except ye do administer un-
to our relief, behold I come unto you even in the land
of Zarahemla, and smite you with the sword, inso-
much that ye can -have no more power to impede the
progress of this people in the cause of our freedom;
for behold the Lord will not suffer that ye shall: live
and wax strong in your iniquities, to destroy his right-
eous people. Behold, can you suppose that the Lord
will spare you and come out in judgment against the
Lamanites, when it is the tradition of their fathers
that has caused their hatred; yea, and it has beemre-
doubled’ by those who have dissented from us, while
your iniquity is for the cause of your love off glory,
and the vain things of the world? Ye know that ye
do transgress the laws of God, and ye do know that

e do trample them under yorir feet. Behold, the

ord saith unto me, if those whom ye have appointed
your governors, do not repent of their sins and iniqul-
ties, ye shall go up to battle against them. And now
behold, I Moroni am constramed, according to the
covenatit which I have made to keep the command:
ments of my God; therefore J would that ye should
adhere to the word of God, and send speedily unto me
of your provisions and of your men, and'also to Hele-
man. And behold if ye will not do this, I come unto
you speedily; for behold;God will not suffer that we
should perish with hunger;’ therefore -he will’ give un,
tous of your food, even if it must! besby the sword
