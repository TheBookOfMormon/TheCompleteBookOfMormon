And now behold, it came to pass, that when the La-
manites had found that Lehicommanded the city, the
were again disappointed, for they feared Lehi exceed-
ingly; nevertheless, their chief captains had sworn
with an oath, to attack the city therefore they brought
up their armies. Now behold, the Lamanites could
not get into their forts of security, by any other way
save by the entrance, because of the highness of: the
bank which had been thrown up, and the depth of the
ditch which had been dug round about, save it were
by the entrance. And thus were the Nephites prepar-
ed to destroy all such as should attempt to climb up to
enter the fort by any other way, by casting over stones
and arrows at them. Thus they were prepared; yea,
a body of their most strong men, with their swords
and their slings, tosmite down all who'should attempt
to come into their place of security, by the place of
entrance; and thus were they prepared to defend
themselves against the Lamanites. And it came to

their armies before the place of entrance; and began
to contend with the ,Nephites, to get into their place
of security; but behold, they were driven’ back from
time to time, insomuch that they were slain, with an
immense slaughter. Now when they found that they

might obtain a pass to their armies, that they might
have an equal chance to fight; but behold, in these at-
tempts, they were-swept off by the stones andthe ar-
rows which were thrown at them; and instead of fil-

earth, they were filled up in a measure, with their
dead: andwounded bodies. Thus the Nephites had all
power over their enemies; and thus the Lamanites did
attempt to destroy the Nephites, until-their chief cap-
tains were all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of
the Lamanites were slain; while on the other hand,
there was not a single soul of the Nephites which was
slain. There were about fifty who ~were wounded,
who had been exposed to the arrows of the Lamanites
through the pass; but they were shielded’ by their
shields, and their breast-plates, and their head-plates,
insomuch that their wounds were upon their legs; ma-
