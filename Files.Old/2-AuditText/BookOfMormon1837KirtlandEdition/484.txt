they could raise grain, lest the Nephites should come
apon them and slay them; therefore Giddianhi gave
commandment unto his armies, that in this year they
should go up to battle against the Nephites,

And it came to pass that they did come up to battles
and it was in the sixth month; and behold, great and
terrile was the day that they did come up to battle;
and they were girded about after the manver of rob-
bers; and they had a lamb-skin about their loins; and
they were died in blood; and their heads were shorn;
and they had head-plates upon them; and great and
terrible was'the appearance of the armies of Giddianhi,
because of their armor, and because of their being dy-
edin blood. And it came to pass that the arinies of
the Nephites, when they saw the appearance of the
army of Giddianhi, had all fallen to the earth, and did

the’ strength of the Lord they did receive them; and
the battle commenced in this the sixth month; and
great and terrible was thebattle thereof; yea, great
and terrible was the slaughter thereof, insomuch that
there never was kriown so great a slaughter among all
the people of Lehi'since'’ he left Jerusalem. And not-
withstanding the threatninigs and’ the oaths which
Giddianhi had made, behold, the-Nephites did beat
at insomuch that they’ did fall back from before

And it came to pass’that Gidgiddoni commanded
that his armies should’ pursue them as far as the bor-
dersof the wilderness, and’ tliat they should not spare
any that should fall into’their hands by the way; and
thus’they did’ pursue them, and’ did slay them, to the
borders of the wilderness,’even until they had fulfilled
the commandment of Gidgiddoni, 

And it came to pasd that” Giddianhi, who had stood
and fought with boldness, was pursued as he fled;
