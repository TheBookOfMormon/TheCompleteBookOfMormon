overpower him, he fled and ran and got upon the tow-
ery which was near the temple. . And Gideon pursued.
after him and was about to get upon tie tower to slay
the king, and the king cast his eyes round about to-
wards the land of Shemlon, and beliold, the army: of
the Lamanites were within the borders of the. land.
And now the king cried out in the anguish of his. soul,
saying, Gideon, spare me, for the Lamanites are upon
us, and they will destroy them; yea, they will des-
troy my people. And now the king was not so much
concerned about. his people, as he was: about his own
life; nevertheless, Gideon did spare his life. : And the
