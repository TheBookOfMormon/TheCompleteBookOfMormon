eommandments unto the children of men, save he shall

thing which he commandeth them.

And it came to pass that when my father had heard
these words, he was exceeding glad, for he knew that
I had been blessed of the Lord. And I, Nephi, and
my brethren, took our journey in the wilderness with
our tents, to go up to the laud of Jerusalem.

And it came to pass that when we had come up to
the land of Jerusalem, I and my brethren did consult
one with another; and we cast lots who of us should
goin unto the house of Laban. And it came to pass
that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman went in un-
to the house of Laban, and he talked with him as he
sat in his house. And he desired of Laban the re-
cords which were engraven upon the plates of brass,
which contained the genealogy of my father.

And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry

ing that Jerusalem must be destroyed, because of the
wickedness of the people.

For behold. they have rejected the words of the
prophets. Wherefore if my father should dwell in the
land after he hath been commanded to flee out of the
land, behold he would also perish. Wherefore it must
needs be that he flee out of the land. And behold it
is wisdom in God that we should obtain these records,
that we may preserve unto our children the es of
our fathers; and also that we may preserve unto them
the words which have been spoken by the mouth of
all the holy prophets, which have been delivered unto
