Nephites, and robbing, and plundering them; and their
hearts were set upon riches, or upon gold, and silver,
and precious stones; yet they sought to obtain these
things by murdering and plundering, that they might
not labor for them with their own hands: thus they
were avery indolent people, many of whom did worship
idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them be
cause of the traditions of their fathers; notwithstand -
ing, the promises of the: Lord were extended unto
them, on the conditions of repentance; therefore this
was the cause for which the sons of Mosiah had un-

they separated themselves one from another, and went

Ishmael. And the king inquired of Ammon if itwere
his desire to dwell'in the land among the Lamanites,
oramong his people?â€™ And Ammon said unto him,
yea, I desire.to dwell among this people fora time;
yea, and perhaps until the day I die.

And it came to pass that king Lamoni was much
