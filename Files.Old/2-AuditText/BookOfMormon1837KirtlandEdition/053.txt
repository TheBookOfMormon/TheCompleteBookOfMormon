fathers, who were led out of Egypt, out of bondage,
and also were preserved inthe wilderness by him;
yea, the God of Abraham, dnd of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob, yieldeth. himself according to the words of
the angel, as a man, into the hands of wicked men, to
be lifted up according: to the words of Zenock, and to
be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and to
be buried in a sepulchre, according to the words of
Zenos, which he spake concerning the three days of
darkness, which should be a sign given of his death,
unto those who should inhabit the isles of the sea;
