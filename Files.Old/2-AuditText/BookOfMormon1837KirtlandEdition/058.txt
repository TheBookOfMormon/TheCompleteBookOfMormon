be carried upon their shoulders. And kings shall be
thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing
mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face
towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet;
and thou shalt know that I am the Lord: for they
shall notâ€™be ashamed that wait for me. For shall the
prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives
delivered? But thus saith the Lord, even the captives
of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the
terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him
that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.
And I will feed them that oppress thee with their
own flesh; they shall be drunken with their own blood,
as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I
the Lord am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the migh-
ty one of Jacob,

are things pertaining to things both temporal and spir-
itual: for it appears that the house of Israel, sooner or

and also among all nations, and behold there are many
who are already lost from the knowledge of those who
are at Jerusalem. Yea, the more part of all the tribes
have been led away; and they are scattered to and fro
upon the isles of the sea: and whither they are, none
of us xnoweth, save that we know that they have been
led away. And since they have been led away, these
things have been prophesied concerning them, and al-
so concerning all those who shall hereafter be iseatter-
