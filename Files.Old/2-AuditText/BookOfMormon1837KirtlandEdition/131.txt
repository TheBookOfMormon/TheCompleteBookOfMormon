And now it came to,pass that the people of Nephi,
under the reign of the second king, began to grow
hard in their hearts, and indulge themselves somewhat
in wicked practices, such as like unto David of old,
desiring many wives and concubines, and also Solo-
mon, his son: yea, and they also began to search
much gold and silver, and began to be lifted up some-

Nephi. And we did magnify our office unto the Lord,
taking upon us the responsibility, answering the sins
of the people upon our own heads, if we did not teach
them the word of God with all diligence; wherefore,
by laboring with ourmights, their blood might not
come upon our garments; otherwise, their blood would
come upon our garments, and we would not be found
spotless at the last day.

and ye yourselves know, that [ have hitherto been

weighed down with much more desire and anxiety for
the welfare of your souls, than I have hitherto been..
For behold, as yet, ye have been obedient unto the
word of the Lord, which I have given unto you. But
behold, hearken ye unto me, and know that by the
help of the all-powerful Creator of heaven and earth,
Tean'tell you concerning your thoughts, how that ye
are beginning to labor-in sin, which sin appeareth ve-
ry abominable unto me, yea, and abominable unto

od. Yea, it grieveth my soul and caugeth me to
shrink with shame before the presence of my Maker, that
