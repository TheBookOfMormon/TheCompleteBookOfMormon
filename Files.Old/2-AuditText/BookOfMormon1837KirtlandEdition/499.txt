late-until the.time of the falfilling of the covenantite
your: fathers:  :
And jnow it.came to pass-that after,the people had
heard these. words, behold..they.began. to weep. and
howl.again,: because.of..the loss of their. kindred: and
friends... And-it came, to. pass. that thus.did the. three
days pass away. And it-svas in the. morning, andthe
darkness dispersed from.off the face of. ihe dnoas and
the earth did:cease to tremble, and the rocks.did cease
to rend, and the dreadful groanings. did cease, and. all
the tumultuous noises did pass away, and the earth did 
cleave together again, that it stood, and the mourning,

are not unto the fulfilling. of the prophecies of many
of the holy.prophets. Behold I say unto you. yea,
many have testified of these..things at the coming of
Christ,.and were slain because they testified of these
things;. yea, the prophet Zenos did testify of these
thinys, and also Zenock spake concerning these things,
because they testified. particular eoncernig us, who are
the remnant of their seed. . Behold. our father Jacob
Blao testified concerning-a. remnant of the seed of Jo-
feph.. And. hehold,. ace not we.a, remnant of the seed
of Josepht. .And these things which. testify of us, are
