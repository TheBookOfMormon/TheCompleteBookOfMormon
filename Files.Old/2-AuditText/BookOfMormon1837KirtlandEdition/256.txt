at Melek, he departed thence, and travelled three
daysâ€™ journey on the north of the land of Melek; and
he came toa city which was called Ammonihah..
Now it was the custom of the people of Nephi, to call
their lands, and their cities, and their villages, yea,
even all their small villages, after the name of him

Jand of Ammonihah.

And it came to pass that when Alma had come to
the city of Ammonihah, he began to preach the word
