promised Mosiah that he would
deliver his sons out of their hands;
neither did they know anything
concerning the Lord; therefore
they delighted in the destruction of
their brethren; and for this cause
they stood to scatter the flocks of
the king.

36 But Ammon stood forth and
began to cast stones at them with
his sling; yea, with mighty power
he did sling stones amongst them;
and thus he slew a certain number
of them insomuch that they began
to be astonished at his power; nev-
ertheless they were angry because
of the slain of their brethren, and
they were determined that he
should fall; therefore, seeing that
they could not hit him with their
stones, they came forth with clubs to
slay him.

37 But behold, every man that
lifted his club to smite Ammon, he
smote off their arms with his sword;
for he did withstand their blows by
smiting their arms with the edge
of his sword, insomuch that they
began to be astonished, and began
to flee before him; yea, and they
were not few in number; and he
caused them to flee by the strength
of his arm.

38 Now six of them had fallen by
the sling, but he slew none save it
were their leader with his sword;
and he smote off as many of their
arms as were lifted against him,
and they were not a few.

39 And when he had driven them
afar off, he returned and they wa-
tered their flocks and returned them
to the pasture of the king, and then
went in unto the king, bearing the
arms which had been smitten off
by the sword of Ammon, of those
who sought to slay him; and they
were carried in unto the king fora
testimony of the things which they
had done.

 

CHAPTER 18

King Lamoni supposes that Ammon is
the Great Spirit.Ammon teaches the
king about the Creation, God’s deal-
ings with men, and the redemption
that comes through Christ.Lamoni
believes and falls to the earth as if dead.
About 90 B.c.

AND it came to pass that king La-
moni caused that his servants
should stand forth and testify to
all the things which they had seen
concerning the matter.

2 And when they had all testified
to the things which they had seen,
and he had learned of the faithful-
ness of Ammon in preserving his
flocks, and also of his great power
in contending against those who
sought to slay him, he was aston-
ished exceedingly, and said: Surely,
this is more than a man. Behold,
is not this the Great Spirit who
doth send such great punishments
upon this people, because of their
murders?

3 And they answered the king,
and said: Whether he be the Great
Spirit or a man, we know not; but
this much we do know, that he
cannot be slain by the enemies
of the king; neither can they scatter
the king’s flocks when he is with
us, because of his expertness and
great strength; therefore, we know
that he is a friend to the king. And
now, O king, we do not believe that
aman has such great power, for we
know he cannot be slain.

4 And now, when the king heard
these words, he said unto them: Now
I know that it is the Great Spirit;
and he has come down at this time
to preserve your lives, that I might
not slay you as I did your breth-
ren. Now this is the Great Spirit
of whom our fathers have spoken.

5 Now this was the tradition of
Lamoni, which he had received
