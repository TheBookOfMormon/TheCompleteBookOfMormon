kingdoms of the idols, and whose
graven images did excel them of
Jerusalem and of Samaria;

11 Shall I not, as I have done unto
Samaria and her idols, so do to Je-
rusalem and to her idols?

12 Wherefore it shall come to pass
that when the Lord hath performed
his whole work upon Mount Zion
and upon Jerusalem, I will punish
the fruit of the stout heart of the
king of Assyria, and the glory of
his high looks.

13 For he saith: By the strength
of my hand and by my wisdom I
have done these things; for 1 am
prudent; and I have moved the bor-
ders of the people, and have robbed
their treasures, and I have put down
the inhabitants like a valiant man;

14 And my hand hath found as a
nest the riches of the people; and
as one gathereth eggs that are left
have I gathered all the earth; and
there was none that moved the wing,
or opened the mouth, or peeped.

15 Shall the ax boast itself against
him that heweth therewith? Shall
the saw magnify itself against him
that shaketh it? As if the rod should
shake itself against them that lift it
up, or as if the staff should lift up
itself as if it were no wood!

16 Therefore shall the Lord, the
Lord of Hosts, send among his fat
ones, leanness; and under his glory
he shall kindle a burning like the
burning of a fire.

17 And the light of Israel shall be for
a fire, and his Holy One fora flame,
and shall burn and shall devour his
thorns and his briers in one day;

 

18 And shall consume the glory
of his forest, and of his fruitful
field, both soul and body; and they
shall be as when a standard-bearer
fainteth.

19 And the rest of the trees of
his forest shall be few, that a child
may write them.

20 And it shall come to pass in that
day, that the remnant of Israel, and
such as are escaped of the house
of Jacob, shall no more again stay
upon him that smote them, but
shall stay upon the Lord, the Holy
One of Israel, in truth.

21 The remnant shall return, yea,
even the remnant of Jacob, unto the
mighty God.

22 For though thy people Israel
be as the sand of the sea, yet a rem-
nant of them shall return; the con-
sumption decreed shall overflow
with righteousness.

23 For the Lord God of Hosts shall
make a consumption, even deter-
mined in all the land.

24 Therefore, thus saith the Lord
God of Hosts: O my people that
dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of
the Assyrian; he shall smite thee
with a rod, and shall lift up his
staff against thee, after the man-
ner of Egypt.

25 For yet a very little while, and
the indignation shall cease, and
mine anger in their destruction.

26 And the Lord of Hosts shall stir
up a scourge for him according to
the slaughter of Midian at the rock
of Oreb; and as his rod was upon
the sea so shall he lift it up after
the manner of Egypt.
