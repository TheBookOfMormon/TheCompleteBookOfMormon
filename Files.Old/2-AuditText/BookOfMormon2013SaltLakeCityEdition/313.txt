did not prosper; even so it is with
things which are spiritual.

44 For behold, it is as easy to give
heed to the word of Christ, which
will point to you a straight course to
eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers
to give heed to this compass, which
would point unto them a straight
course to the promised land.

45 And now I say, is there not
a type in this thing? For just as
surely as this director did bring our
fathers, by following its course, to
the promised land, shall the words
of Christ, if we follow their course,
carry us beyond this vale of sorrow
into a far better land of promise.

46 O my son, do not let us be
slothful because of the easiness
of the way; for so was it with our
fathers; for so was it prepared for
them, that if they would look they
might live; even so it is with us.
The way is prepared, and if we will
look we may live forever.

47 And now, my son, see that ye
take care of these sacred things,
yea, see that ye look to God and
live. Go unto this people and de-
clare the word, and be sober. My
son, farewell.

The commandments of Alma to his
son Shiblon.

CHAPTER 38

Shiblon was persecuted for righteous-
ness’ sake.Salvation is in Christ, who

 

is the life and the light of the world.
Bridle all your passions. About 74 B.C.

My son, give ear to my words, for
I say unto you, even as I said unto
Helaman, that inasmuch as ye shall
keep the commandments of God
ye shall prosper in the land; and
inasmuch as ye will not keep the
commandments of God ye shall be
cut off from his presence.

2 And now, my son, I trust that I
shall have great joy in you, because
of your steadiness and your faith-
fulness unto God; for as you have
commenced in your youth to look
to the Lord your God, even sol hope
that you will continue in keeping
his commandments; for blessed is
he that endureth to the end.

31 say unto you, my son, that I
have had great joy in thee already,
because of thy faithfulness and thy
diligence, and thy patience and
thy long-suffering among the peo-
ple of the Zoramites.

4 For I know that thou wast in
bonds; yea, and I also know that
thou wast stoned for the word’s sake;
and thou didst bear all these things
with patience because the Lord was
with thee; and now thou knowest
that the Lord did deliver thee.

5 And now my son, Shiblon, I
would that ye should remember, that
as much as ye shall put your trust
in God even so much ye shall be de-
livered out of your trials, and your
troubles, and your afflictions, and
ye shall be lifted up at the last day.

6 Now, my son, I would not that ye
should think that I know these
