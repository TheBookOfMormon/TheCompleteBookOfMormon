to sin, and to do that which is evil
continually.

13 But behold, that which is of God
inviteth and enticeth to do good
continually; wherefore, every thing
which inviteth and enticeth to do
good, and to love God, and to serve
him, is 4inspired of God.

14 Wherefore, take heed, my be-
loved brethren, that ye do not judge
that which is evil to be of God,
or that which is good and of God to
be of the devil.

15 For behold, my brethren, it is
given unto you to judge, that ye
may know good from evil; and the
way to judge is as plain, that ye may
know with a perfect knowledge, as
the daylight is from the dark night.

16 For behold, the Spirit of Christ
is given to every man, that he may
know good from evil; wherefore,
I show unto you the way to judge;
for every thing which inviteth to
do good, and to persuade to believe
in Christ, is sent forth by the power
and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may
know with a perfect knowledge it
is of God.

17 But whatsoever thing persuad-
eth men to do evil, and believe not
in Christ, and deny him, and serve
not God, then ye may know with
a perfect knowledge it is of the
devil; for after this manner doth
the devil work, for he persuadeth
no man to do good, no, not one; nei-
ther do his angels; neither do they
who subject themselves unto him.

 

18 And now, my brethren, seeing
that ye know the light by which
ye may judge, which light is the
light of Christ, see that ye do not
judge wrongfully; for with that
same judgment which ye judge ye
shall also be judged.

19 Wherefore, I beseech of you,
brethren, that ye should search
diligently in the light of Christ
that ye may know good from evil;
and if ye will lay hold upon every
good thing, and condemn it not, ye
certainly will be a child of Christ.

20 And now, my brethren, how
is it possible that ye can lay hold
upon every good thing?

21 And now I come to that faith,
of which I said I would speak; and
I will tell you the way whereby ye
may lay hold on every good thing.

22 For behold, God knowing all
things, being from everlasting to
everlasting, behold, he sent angels
to minister unto the children of
men, to make manifest concern-
ing the coming of Christ; and in
Christ there should come every
good thing.

23 And God also declared unto
prophets, by his own mouth, that
Christ should come.

24 And behold, there were divers
ways that he did manifest things
unto the children of men, which
were good; and all things which are
good cometh of Christ; otherwise
men were fallen, and there could
no good thing come unto them.
