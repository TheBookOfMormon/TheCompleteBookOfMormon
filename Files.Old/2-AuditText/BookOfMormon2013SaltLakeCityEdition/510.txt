Kimnor; and behold, I am fair, and
I will dance before him, and I will
please him, that he will desire me
to wife; wherefore if he shall desire
of thee that ye shall give unto him
me to wife, then shall ye say: I will
give her if ye will bring unto me
the head of my father, the king.

11 And now Omer was a friend
to Akish; wherefore, when Jared
had sent for Akish, the daughter
of Jared danced before him that
she pleased him, insomuch that he
desired her to wife. And it came to
pass that he said unto Jared: Give
her unto me to wife.

12 And Jared said unto him: I will
give her unto you, if ye will bring
unto me the head of my father, the
king.

13 And it came to pass that Akish
gathered in unto the house of Jared
all his kinsfolk, and said unto them:
Will ye swear unto me that ye will
be faithful unto me in the thing
which I shall desire of you?

14 And it came to pass that they
all sware unto him, by the God of
heaven, and also by the heavens,
and also by the earth, and by their
heads, that whoso should vary from
the assistance which Akish desired
should lose his head; and whoso
should divulge whatsoever thing
Akish made known unto them, the
same should lose his life.

15 And it came to pass that thus
they did agree with Akish. And
Akish did administer unto them the
oaths which were given by them of
old who also sought power, which
had been handed down even from
â€™Cain, who was a murderer from
the beginning.

16 And they were kept up by the
power of the devil to administer
these oaths unto the people, to keep
them in darkness, to help such as

 

sought power to gain power, and to
murder, and to plunder, and to lie,
and to commit all manner of wick-
edness and whoredoms.

17 And it was the daughter of
Jared who put it into his heart to
search up these things of old; and
Jared put it into the heart of Akish;
wherefore, Akish administered it
unto his kindred and friends, lead-
ing them away by fair promises to
do whatsoever thing he desired.

18 And it came to pass that they
formed a secret combination, even
as they of old; which combination is
most abominable and wicked above
all, in the sight of God;

19 For the Lord worketh not in se-
cret combinations, neither doth he
will that man should shed blood,
but in all things hath forbidden it,
from the beginning of man.

20 And now I, Moroni, do not write
the manner of their oaths and com-
binations, for it hath been made
known unto me that they are had
among all people, and they are
had among the Lamanites.

21 And they have caused the de-
struction of this people of whom I
am now speaking, and also the de-
struction of the people of Nephi.

22 And whatsoever nation shall
uphold such secret combinations,
to get power and gain, until they
shall spread over the nation, behold,
they shall be destroyed; for the Lord
will not suffer that the blood of his
saints, which shall be shed by them,
shall always cry unto him from the
ground for vengeance upon them
and yet he avenge them not.

23 Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is
wisdom in God that these things
should be shown unto you, that
thereby ye may repent of your sins,
and suffer not that these murderous
combinations shall get above you,
