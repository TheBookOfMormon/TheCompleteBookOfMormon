hath said should scatter this people,
and this people should be counted
as naught among them.therefore
I write a small abridgment, dar-
ing not to give a full account of the
things which I have seen, because
of the commandment which I have
received, and also that ye might
not have too great sorrow because
of the wickedness of this people.

10 And now behold, this I speak
unto their seed, and also to the Gen-
tiles who have care for the house of
Israel, that realize and know from
whence their blessings come.

11 For I know that such will sor-
row for the calamity of the house
of Israel; yea, they will sorrow for
the destruction of this people; they
will sorrow that this people had
not repented that they might have
been clasped in the arms of Jesus.

12 Now these things are written
unto the remnant of the house of
Jacob; and they are written after this
manner, because it is known of God
that wickedness will not bring them
forth unto them; and they are to be
4hid up unto the Lord that they may
come forth in his own due time.

13 And this is the commandment
which I have received; and behold,
they shall come forth accord-
ing to the commandment of the
Lord, when he shall see fit, in his
wisdom.

14 And behold, they shall go unto
the unbelieving of the Jews; and
for this intent shall they go.that
they may be persuaded that Jesus

 

is the Christ, the Son of the living
God; that the Father may bring
about, through his most Beloved,
his great and eternal purpose, in
restoring the Jews, or all the house
of Israel, to the land of their inheri-
tance, which the Lord their God
hath given them, unto the fulfilling
of his covenant;

15 And also that the seed of this
people may more fully believe his
gospel, which shall go forth unto
them from the Gentiles; for this
people shall be scattered, and shall
become a dark, a filthy, and a loath-
some people, beyond the descrip-
tion of that which ever hath been
amongst us, yea, even that which
hath been among the Lamanites, and
this because of their unbelief and
idolatry.

16 For behold, the Spirit of the
Lord hath already ceased to strive
with their fathers; and they are
without Christ and God in the world;
and they are driven about as chaff
before the wind.

17 They were once a delightsome
people, and they had Christ for their
shepherd; yea, they were led even
by God the Father.

18 But now, behold, they are led
about by Satan, even as chaff is
driven before the wind, or as a ves-
sel is tossed about upon the waves,
without sail or anchor, or without
anything wherewith to steer her;
and even as she is, so are they.

19 And behold, the Lord hath re-
served their blessings, which they
