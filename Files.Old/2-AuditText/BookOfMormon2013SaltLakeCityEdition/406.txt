20 And behold, if the Lord shall
say unto a man.Because of thine
iniquities, thou shalt be accursed
forever.it shall be done.

21 And if the Lord shall say.Be-
cause of thine iniquities thou shalt
be cut off from my presence.he
will cause that it shall be so.

22 And wo unto him to whom he
shall say this, for it shall be unto
him that will do iniquity, and he
cannot be saved; therefore, for this
cause, that men might be saved, hath
repentance been declared.

23 Therefore, blessed are they who
will repent and hearken unto the
voice of the Lord their God; for these
are they that shall be saved.

24 And may God grant, in his great
fulness, that men might be brought
unto repentance and good works, that
they might be restored unto grace
for grace, according to their works.

25 And I would that all men might
be saved. But we read that in the
great and last day there are some
who shall be cast out, yea, who shall
be cast off from the presence of
the Lord;

26 Yea, who shall be consigned to
a state of endless misery, fulfilling
the words which say: They that have
done good shall have everlasting
life; and they that have done evil
shall have everlasting damnation.
And thus it is. Amen.

The prophecy of Samuel, the
Lamanite, to the Nephites.
Comprising chapters 13 through 15.

CHAPTER 13

Samuel the Lamanite prophesies the
destruction of the Nephites unless

 

they repent.They and their riches
are cursed.They reject and stone the
prophets, are encircled about by de-
mons, and seek for happiness in doing
iniquity. About 6 B.c.

AND now it came to pass in the
eighty and sixth year, the Nephites
did still remain in wickedness, yea,
in great wickedness, while the La-
manites did observe strictly to keep
the commandments of God, accord-
ing to the law of Moses.

2 And it came to pass that in this
year there was one Samuel, a La-
manite, came into the land of Zara-
hemla, and began to preach unto the
people. And it came to pass that he
did preach, many days, repentance
unto the people, and they did cast
him out, and he was about to return
to his own land.

3 But behold, the voice of the Lord
came unto him, that he should re-
turn again, and prophesy unto the
people whatsoever things should
come into his heart.

4 And it came to pass that they
would not suffer that he should en-
ter into the city; therefore he went
and got upon the wall thereof, and
stretched forth his hand and cried
with a loud voice, and prophesied
unto the people whatsoever things
the Lord put into his heart.

5 And he said unto them: Behold,
I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the
words of the Lord which he doth put
into my heart; and behold he hath
put it into my heart to say unto this
people that the sword of justice
hangeth over this people; and four
hundred years pass not away save
the sword of justice falleth upon
this people.

6 Yea, heavy destruction awaiteth
