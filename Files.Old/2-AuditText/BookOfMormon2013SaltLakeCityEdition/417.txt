world, and to do the will, both fof
the Father and of the Son.of the
Father because of me, and of the
Son because of my flesh. And be-
hold, the time is at hand, and this
night shall the sign be given.

15 And it came to pass that the
words which came unto Nephi
were fulfilled, according as they
had been spoken; for behold, at the
going down of the sun there was
â€™no darkness; and the people began
to be astonished because there was
no darkness when the night came.

16 And there were many, who
had not believed the words of the
prophets, who fell to the earth and
became as if they were dead, for
they knew that the great plan of
destruction which they had laid for
those who believed in the words of
the prophets had been frustrated;
for the sign which had been given
was already at hand.

17 And they began to know that
the Son of God must shortly appear;
yea, in fine, all the people upon the
face of the whole earth from the
west to the east, both in the land
north and in the land south, were
so exceedingly astonished that they
fell to the earth.

18 For they knew that the proph-
ets had testified of these things for
many years, and that the sign which
had been given was already at hand;
and they began to fear because of
their iniquity and their unbelief.

19 And it came to pass that there
was no darkness in all that night,
but it was as light as though it was
mid-day. And it came to pass that the
sun did rise in the morning again,
according to its proper order; and
they knew that it was the day that
the Lord should be born, because
of the sign which had been given.

 

20 And it had come to pass, yea,
all things, every whit, according to
the words of the prophets.

21 And it came to pass also that
a new star did appear, according
to the word.

22 And it came to pass that from
this time forth there began to be
4lyings sent forth among the people,
by Satan, to harden their hearts, to
the intent that they might not be-
lieve in those signs and wonders
which they had seen; but notwith-
standing these lyings and deceivings
the more part of the people did
believe, and were converted unto
the Lord.

23 And it came to pass that Nephi
went forth among the people, and
also many others, baptizing unto
repentance, in the which there was
a great remission of sins. And thus
the people began again to have
peace in the land.

24 And there were no contentions,
save it were a few that began to
preach, endeavoring to prove by
the scriptures that it was no more
expedient to observe the law of
Moses. Now in this thing they did
err, having not understood the
scriptures.

25 But it came to pass that they
soon became converted, and were
convinced of the error which they
were in, for it was made known
unto them that the law was not yet
fulfilled, and that it must be ful-
filled in every whit; yea, the word
came unto them that it must be
fulfilled; yea, that one jot or tittle
should not pass away till it should
all be fulfilled; therefore in this
same year were they brought to a
knowledge of their error and did
confess their faults.

26 And thus the ninety and second
