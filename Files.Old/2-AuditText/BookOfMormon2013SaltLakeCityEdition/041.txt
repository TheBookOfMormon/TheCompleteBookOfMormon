19 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, spake much unto them con-
cerning these things; yea, I spake
unto them concerning the restora-
tion of the Jews in the latter days.

20 And I did rehearse unto them
the words of Isaiah, who spake
â€™concerning the restoration of the
Jews, or of the house of Israel; and
after they were restored they should
no more be confounded, neither
should they be scattered again.
And it came to pass that I did speak
many words unto my brethren, that
they were pacified and did humble
themselves before the Lord.

21 And it came to pass that they
did speak unto me again, saying:
What meaneth this thing which
our father saw in a dream? What
meaneth the tree which he saw?

22 And I said unto them: It was a
representation of the tree of life.

23 And they said unto me: What
meaneth the rod of iron which
our father saw, that led to the tree?

24 And I said unto them that it
was the word of God; and whoso
would hearken unto the word of
God, and would hold fast unto it,
they would never perish; neither
could the temptations and the
fiery darts of the adversary over-
power them unto blindness, to lead
them away to destruction.

25 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort
them to give heed unto the word
of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them
with all the energies of my soul, and
with all the faculty which I pos-
sessed, that they would give heed
to the word of God and remember

 

to keep his commandments always
in all things.

26 And they said unto me: What
meaneth the river of water which
our father saw?

27 And I said unto them that the
water which my father saw was
filthiness; and so much was his
mind swallowed up in other things
that he beheld not the filthiness of
the water.

28 And I said unto them that it was
an awful gulf, which separated the
wicked from the tree of life, and
also from the saints of God.

29 And I said unto them that it
was a representation of that awful
hell, which the angel said unto me
was prepared for the wicked.

30 And I said unto them that
our father also saw that the justice
of God did also divide the wicked
from the righteous; and the bright-
ness thereof was like unto the
brightness of a flaming fire, which
ascendeth up unto God forever and
ever, and hath no end.

31 And they said unto me: Doth
this thing mean the torment of the
body in the days of probation, or
doth it mean the final state of the
soul after the death of the temporal
body, or doth it speak of the things
which are temporal?

32 And it came to pass that I said
unto them that it was a represen-
tation of things both temporal and
Spiritual; for the day should come
that they must be judged of their
works, yea, even the works which
were done by the temporal body in
their days of probation.
