51 And the Lord said: Yea, I will
spare it a little longer, for it griev-
eth me that I should lose the trees
of my vineyard.

52 Wherefore, let us take of the
branches of these which I have
planted in the nethermost parts of
my vineyard, and let us graft them
into the tree from whence they came;
and let us pluck from the tree those
branches whose fruit is most bitter,
and graft in the natural branches of
the tree in the stead thereof.

53 And this will I do that the tree
may not perish, that, perhaps, I
may preserve unto myself the roots
thereof for mine own purpose.

54 And, behold, the roots of the
natural branches of the tree which
I planted whithersoever I would are
yet alive; wherefore, that I may pre-
serve them also for mine own pur-
pose, I will take of the branches of
this tree, and I will graft them in
unto them. Yea, I will graft in unto
them the branches of their mother
tree, that I may preserve the roots
also unto mine own self, that when
they shall be sufficiently strong
perhaps they may bring forth good
fruit unto me, and I may yet have
glory in the fruit of my vineyard.

55 And it came to pass that they
took from the natural tree which
had become wild, and grafted in
unto the natural trees, which also
had become wild.

56 And they also took of the natu-
ral trees which had become wild,
and grafted into their mother tree.

57 And the Lord of the vineyard
said unto the servant: Pluck not the
wild branches from the trees, save
it be those which are most bitter;
and in them ye shall graft accord-
ing to that which I have said.

 

58 And we will nourish again the
trees of the vineyard, and we will
trim up the branches thereof; and
we will pluck from the trees those
branches which are ripened, that
must perish, and cast them into
the fire.

59 And this I do that, perhaps, the
roots thereof may take strength be-
cause of their goodness; and because
of the change of the branches, that
the good may overcome the evil.

60 And because that I have pre-
served the natural branches and
the roots thereof, and that I have
grafted in the natural branches again.
into their mother tree, and have
preserved the roots of their mother
tree, that, perhaps, the trees of my
vineyard may bring forth again
good fruit; and that I may have joy
again in the fruit of my vineyard,
and, perhaps, that I may rejoice
exceedingly that I have preserved
the roots and the branches of the
first fruit.

61 Wherefore, go to, and call ser-
vants, that we may labor diligently
with our might in the vineyard, that
we may prepare the way, that [may
bring forth again the natural fruit,
which natural fruit is good and the
most precious above all other fruit.

62 Wherefore, let us go to and la-
bor with our might this last time,
for behold the end draweth nigh,
and this is for the last time that I
shall prune my vineyard.

63 Graft in the branches; begin at
the last that they may be first, and
that the first may be last, and dig
about the trees, both old and young,
the first and the last; and the last
and the first, that all may be nour-
ished once again for the last time.

64 Wherefore, dig about them,
