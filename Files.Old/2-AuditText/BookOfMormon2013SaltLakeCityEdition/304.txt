28 And now behold, my beloved
brethren, I say unto you, do not sup-
pose that this is all; for after ye have
done all these things, if ye turn
away the needy, and the naked,
and visit not the sick and afflicted,
and impart of your substance, if ye
have, to those who stand in need.1
say unto you, if ye do not any of.
these things, behold, your prayer
is vain, and availeth you nothing,
and ye are as hypocrites who do
deny the faith.

29 Therefore, if ye do not remem-
ber to be charitable, ye are as dross,
which the refiners do cast out, (it
being of no worth) and is trodden
under foot of men.

30 And now, my brethren, I would
that, after ye have received so
many witnesses, seeing that the holy
scriptures testify of these things, ye
come forth and bring fruit unto
repentance.

31 Yea,  would that ye would come
forth and harden not your hearts
any longer; for behold, now is the
time and the day of your salvation;
and therefore, if ye will repent and
harden not your hearts, immedi-
ately shall the great plan of redemp-
tion be brought about unto you.

32 For behold, this life is the time
for men to prepare to meet God;
yea, behold the day of this life is
the day for men to perform their
labors.

33 And now, as I said unto you
before, as ye have had so many

 

witnesses, therefore, I beseech of
you that ye do not procrastinate the
day of your repentance until the
end; for after this day of life, which
is given us to prepare for eternity,
behold, if we do not improve our
time while in this life, then cometh
the night of darkness wherein
there can be no labor performed.

34 Ye cannot say, when ye are
brought to that awful crisis, that
I will repent, that I will return to
my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for
that same spirit which doth possess
your bodies at the time that ye go
out of this life, that same spirit will
have power to possess your body in
that eternal world.

35 For behold, if ye have procras-
tinated the day of your repentance
even until death, behold, ye have
become subjected to the spirit of
the devil, and he doth seal you his;
therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath
withdrawn from you, and hath no
place in you, and the devil hath
all power over you; and this is the
final state of the wicked.

36 And this I know, because the
Lord hath said he dwelleth not in
unholy temples, but in the hearts
of the righteous doth he dwell; yea,
and he has also said that the righ-
teous shall sit down in his king-
dom, to go no more out; but their
garments should be made white
through the blood of the Lamb.

37 And now, my beloved brethren,
I desire that ye should remember
