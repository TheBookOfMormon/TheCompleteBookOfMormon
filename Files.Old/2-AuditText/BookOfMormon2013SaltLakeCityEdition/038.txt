looked and beheld the whore of all
the earth, and she sat upon many
waters; and she had dominion over
’all the earth, among all nations,
kindreds, tongues, and people.

12 And it came to pass that I beheld
the church of the Lamb of God, and
its numbers were few, because of
the wickedness and abominations
of the whore who sat upon many
waters; nevertheless, I beheld that
the church of the Lamb, who were
the saints of God, were also upon
’all the face of the earth; and their
dominions upon the face of the earth
were small, because of the wicked-
ness of the great whore whom I saw.

13 And it came to pass that I beheld
that the great mother of abomina-
tions did gather together multitudes
upon the face of all the earth, among
all the nations of the Gentiles, to
fight against the Lamb of God.

14 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, beheld the power of the
Lamb of God, that it descended upon
the saints of the church of the Lamb,
and upon the covenant people of
the Lord, who were scattered upon
all the face of the earth; and they
were armed with righteousness
and with the power of God in great
glory.

15 And it came to pass that I beheld
that the wrath of God was poured
out upon that great and abominable
church, insomuch that there were
wars and rumors of wars among
all the nations and kindreds of
the earth.

16 And as there began to be wars
and rumors of wars among all the

 

nations which belonged to the
mother of abominations, the angel
spake unto me, saying: Behold, the
wrath of God is upon the mother
of harlots; and behold, thou seest
all these things.

17 And when the day cometh
that the wrath of God is poured
out upon the mother of harlots,
which is the great and abomina-
ble church of all the earth, whose
founder is the devil, then, at that
day, the work of the Father shall
commence, in preparing the way
for the fulfilling of his covenants,
which he hath made to his people
who are of the house of Israel.

18 And it came to pass that the
angel spake unto me, saying: Look!

19 And [looked and beheld a man,
and he was dressed in a white robe.

20 And the angel said unto me:
Behold one of the twelve apostles
of the Lamb.

21 Behold, he shall see and write
the remainder of these things; yea,
and also many things which have
been.

22 And he shall also write con-
cerning the end of the world.

23 Wherefore, the things which
he shall write are just and true;
and behold they are written in the
book which thou beheld proceed-
ing out of the mouth of the Jew;
and at the time they proceeded out
of the mouth of the Jew, or, at the
time the book proceeded out of the
mouth of the Jew, the things which
were written were plain and pure,
and most precious and easy to the
understanding of all men.
