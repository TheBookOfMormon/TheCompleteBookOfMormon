little should be required; and to
him that had not should be given.

28 And thus they should impart
of their substance of their own
free will and good desires towards
God, and to those priests that stood
in need, yea, and to every needy,
naked soul.

29 And this he said unto them,
having been commanded of God;
and they did walk uprightly before
God, imparting to one another both
temporally and spiritually accord-
ing to their needs and their wants.

30 And now it came to pass that all
this was done in Mormon, yea, by
the waters of Mormon, in the forest
that was near the waters of Mormon;
yea, the place of Mormon, the waters
of Mormon, the forest of Mormon,
how beautiful are they to the eyes
of them who there came to the
knowledge of their Redeemer; yea,
and how blessed are they, for they
shall sing to his praise forever.

31 And these things were done in
the borders of the land, that they
might not come to the knowledge
of the king.

32 But behold, it came to pass that
the king, having discovered a move-
ment among the people, sent his
servants to watch them. Therefore
on the day that they were assem-
bling themselves together to hear
the word of the Lord they were dis-
covered unto the king.

33 And now the king said that
Alma was stirring up the people
to rebellion against him; therefore
he sent his army to destroy them.

34 And it came to pass that Alma
and the people of the Lord were ap-
prised of the coming of the kingâ€™s
army; therefore they took their tents
and their families and departed
into the wilderness.

 

35 And they were in number about
four hundred and fifty souls.

the king returned, having searched
in vain for the people of the Lord.

2 And now behold, the forces of
the king were small, having been
reduced, and there began to bea
division among the remainder of
the people.

3 And the lesser part began to
breathe out threatenings against
the king, and there began to be a
great contention among them.

4 And now there was a man among
them whose name was Gideon, and
he being a strong man and an en-
emy to the king, therefore he drew
his sword, and swore in his wrath
that he would slay the king.

5 And it came to pass that he
fought with the king; and when the
king saw that he was about to over-
power him, he fled and ran and got
upon the tower which was near the
temple.

6 And Gideon pursued after him
and was about to get upon the tower
to slay the king, and the king cast
his eyes round about towards the
land of Shemlon, and behold, the
army of the Lamanites were within
the borders of the land.

7 And now the king cried out in the
anguish of his soul, saying: Gideon,
spare me, for the Lamanites are
upon us, and they will destroy us;
yea, they will destroy my people.

8 And now the king was not so
