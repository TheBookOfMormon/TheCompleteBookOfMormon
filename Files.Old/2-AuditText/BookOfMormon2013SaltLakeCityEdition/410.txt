to redeem all those who shall be-
lieve on his name.

3 And behold, this will I give unto
you for a sign at the time of his
coming; for behold, there shall be
great lights in heaven, insomuch
that in the night before he cometh
there shall be no darkness, insomuch
that it shall appear unto man as if.
it was day.

4 Therefore, there shall be one
day and a night and a day, as if.
it were one day and there were no
night; and this shall be unto you
for a sign; for ye shall know of the
rising of the sun and also of its set-
ting; therefore they shall know ofa
surety that there shall be two days
and a night; nevertheless the night
shall not be darkened; and it shall
be the night before he is born.

5 And behold, there shall a new
star arise, such an one as ye never
have beheld; and this also shall be
a sign unto you.

6 And behold this is not all, there
shall be many signs and wonders
in heaven.

7 And it shall come to pass that ye
shall all be amazed, and wonder, inso-
much that ye shall fall to the earth.

8 And it shall come to pass that
whosoever shall believe on the Son
of God, the same shall have ever-
lasting life.

9 And behold, thus hath the Lord
commanded me, by his angel, that
I should come and tell this thing
unto you; yea, he hath commanded
that I should prophesy these things
unto you; yea, he hath said unto
me: Cry unto this people, repent

have cast me out from among you.

11 And ye shall hear my words,
for, for this intent have I come up
upon the walls of this city, that ye
might hear and know of the judg-
ments of God which do await you
because of your iniquities, and also
that ye might know the conditions
of repentance;

12 And also that ye might know of
the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son
of God, the Father of heaven and of
earth, the Creator of all things from
the beginning; and that ye might
know of the signs of his coming,
to the intent that ye might believe
on his name.

13 And if ye believe on his name
ye will repent of all your sins, that
thereby ye may have a remission of
them through his merits.

14 And behold, again, another
sign I give unto you, yea, a sign of
his death.

15 For behold, he surely must
die that salvation may come; yea,
it behooveth him and becometh
expedient that he dieth, to bring to
pass the resurrection of the dead,
that thereby men may be brought
into the presence of the Lord.

16 Yea, behold, this death bringeth

deemeth all mankind from the first
death.that spiritual death; for all
mankind, by the fall of Adam be-
