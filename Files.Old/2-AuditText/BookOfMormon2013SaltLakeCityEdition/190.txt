power, and sufferings, and death
of Christ, and his resurrection and
ascension into heaven.

3 And as many as would hear his
word he did teach. And he taught
them privately, that it might not
come to the knowledge of the king.
And many did believe his words.

4 And it came to pass that as many
as did believe him did go forth to
aplace which was called Mormon,
having received its name from the
king, being in the borders of the
land having been infested, by times
or at seasons, by wild beasts.

5 Now, there was in Mormon a
fountain of pure water, and Alma
resorted thither, there being near
the water a thicket of small trees,
where he did hide himself in the
daytime from the searches of the
king.

6 And it came to pass that as many
as believed him went thither to
hear his words.

7 And it came to pass after many
days there were a goodly number
gathered together at the place of
Mormon, to hear the words of Alma.
Yea, all were gathered together that
believed on his word, to hear him.
And he did teach them, and did
preach unto them repentance, and
redemption, and faith on the Lord.

8 And it came to pass that he said
unto them: Behold, here are the wa-
ters of Mormon (for thus were they
called) and now, as ye are desirous
to come into the fold of God, and
to be called his people, and are will-
ing to bear one another’s burdens,
that they may be light;

9 Yea, and are willing to mourn
with those that mourn; yea, and

 

comfort those that stand in need of
comfort, and to stand as witnesses
of God at all times and in all things,
and in all places that ye may be in,
even until death, that ye may be re-
deemed of God, and be numbered
with those of the first resurrection,
that ye may have eternal life.

10 Now I say unto you, if this be
the desire of your hearts, what have
you against being baptized in the
’name of the Lord, as a witness be-
fore him that ye have entered into
a covenant with him, that ye will
serve him and keep his command-
ments, that he may pour out his
Spirit more abundantly upon you?

11 And now when the people had
heard these words, they clapped
their hands for joy, and exclaimed:
This is the desire of our hearts.

12 And now it came to pass that
Alma took Helam, he being one of
the first, and went and stood forth
in the water, and cried, saying: O
Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy
servant, that he may do this work
with holiness of heart.

13 And when he had said these
words, the Spirit of the Lord was
upon him, and he said: Helam, I
baptize thee, having authority
from the Almighty God, as a tes-
timony that ye have entered into
a covenant to serve him until you
are dead as to the mortal body; and
may the Spirit of the Lord be poured
out upon you; and may he grant
unto you eternal life, through the
redemption of Christ, whom he has
prepared from the foundation of
the world.

14 And after Alma had said these
words, both Alma and Helam were
