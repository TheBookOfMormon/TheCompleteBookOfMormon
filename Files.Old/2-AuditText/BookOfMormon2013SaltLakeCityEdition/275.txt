28 Now, the more idle part of the
Lamanites lived in the wilderness,
and dwelt in tents; and they were
spread through the wilderness on
the west, in the land of Nephi; yea,
and also on the west of the land of
Zarahemla, in the borders by the
seashore, and on the west in the
land of Nephi, in the place of their
fathers’ first inheritance, and thus
bordering along by the seashore.

29 And also there were many La-
manites on the east by the seashore,
whither the Nephites had driven
them. And thus the Nephites were
nearly surrounded by the Laman-
ites; nevertheless the Nephites had
taken possession of all the north-
ern parts of the land bordering on
the wilderness, at the head of the
river Sidon, from the east to the
west, round about on the wilder-
ness side; on the north, even until
they came to the land which they
called Bountiful.

30 And it bordered upon the
land which they called Desola-
tion, it being so far northward that
it came into the land which had
been peopled and been destroyed,
of whose bones we have spoken,
which was discovered by the peo-
ple of Zarahemla, it being the place
of their first landing.

31 And they came from there up
into the south wilderness. Thus the
land on the northward was called
Desolation, and the land on the
southward was called Bountiful,
it being the wilderness which is
filled with all manner of wild ani-
mals of every kind, a part of which
had come from the land northward
for food.

32 And now, it was only the dis-
tance of a day and a half’s journey
for a Nephite, on the line Bountiful
and the land Desolation, from the
east to the west sea; and thus the

 

land of Nephi and the land of Zara-
hemla were nearly surrounded by
water, there being a small neck of
land between the land northward
and the land southward.

33 And it came to pass that the
Nephites had inhabited the land
Bountiful, even from the east unto
the west sea, and thus the Nephites
in their wisdom, with their guards
and their armies, had hemmed in
the Lamanites on the south, that
thereby they should have no more
possession on the north, that they
might not overrun the land north-
ward.

34 Therefore the Lamanites could
have no more possessions only in
the land of Nephi, and the wilder-
ness round about. Now this was
wisdom in the Nephites.as the
Lamanites were an enemy to them,
they would not suffer their afflictions
on every hand, and also that they
might have a country whither
they might flee, according to their
desires.

35 And now I, after having said
this, return again to the account
of Ammon and Aaron, Omner and
Himni, and their brethren.

CHAPTER 23

Religious freedom is proclaimed.The
Lamanites in seven lands and cities
are converted.They call themselves
Anti-Nephi-Lehies and are freed from
the curse.The Amalekites and the

Amulonites reject the truth. About
90-77 B.C.

BEHOLD, now it came to pass that
the king of the Lamanites sent a
proclamation among all his people,
that they should not lay their hands
on Ammon, or Aaron, or Omner, or
Himni, nor either of their brethren
who should go forth preaching the
word of God, in whatsoever place
