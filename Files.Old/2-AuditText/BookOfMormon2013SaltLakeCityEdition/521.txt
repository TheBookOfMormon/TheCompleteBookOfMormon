CHAPTER 13

Ether speaks of a New Jerusalem to
be built in America by the seed of Jo-
seph.He prophesies, is cast out, writes
the Jaredite history, and foretells the
destruction of the Jaredites.War rages
over all the land.

AND now I, Moroni, proceed to finish
my record concerning the destruc-
tion of the people of whom I have
been writing.

2 For behold, they rejected all the
words of Ether; for he truly told them
of all things, from the beginning of
man; and that after the waters had
receded from off the face of this
land it became a choice land above
all other lands, a chosen land of the
Lord; wherefore the Lord would
have that all men should serve him
who dwell upon the face thereof;

3 And that it was the place of
the New Jerusalem, which should
â€™come down out of heaven, and the
holy sanctuary of the Lord.

4 Behold, Ether saw the days of
Christ, and he spake concerning
a New Jerusalem upon this land.

5 And he spake also concerning the
house of Israel, and the Jerusalem
from whence Lehi should come.af-
ter it should be destroyed it should
be built up again, a holy city unto
the Lord; wherefore, it could not be
anew Jerusalem for it had been in

 

atime of old; but it should be built
up again, and become a holy city of
the Lord; and it should be built unto
the house of Israel.

6 And that aNew Jerusalem should
be built up upon this land, unto the
remnant of the seed of Joseph, for
which things there has been a type.

7 For as Joseph brought his father
down into the land of Egypt, even
so he died there; wherefore, the
Lord brought a remnant of the seed
of Joseph out of the land of Jeru-
salem, that he might be merciful
unto the seed of Joseph that they
should perish not, even as he was
merciful unto the father of Joseph
that he should perish not.

8 Wherefore, the remnant of the
house of Joseph shall be built upon
this land; and it shall be a land of
their inheritance; and they shall
build up a holy city unto the Lord,
like unto the Jerusalem of old; and
they shall no more be confounded,
until the end come when the earth
shall pass away.

9 And there shall be anew heaven
and a new earth; and they shall be
like unto the old save the old have
passed away, and all things have
become new.

10 And then cometh the New Je-
rusalem; and blessed are they who
dwell therein, for it is they whose
garments are white through the
blood of the Lamb; and they are
they who are numbered among the
remnant of the seed of Joseph, who
were of the house of Israel.

11 And then also cometh the
Jerusalem of old; and the inhabi-
tants thereof, blessed are they, for
