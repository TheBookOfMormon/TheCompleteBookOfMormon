wrought miracles wrought them by
faith, even those who were before
Christ and also those who were after.

17 And it was by faith that the
three disciples obtained a promise
that they should not taste of death;
and they obtained not the promise
until after their faith.

18 And neither at any time hath
any wrought miracles until after
their faith; wherefore they first
believed in the Son of God.

19 And there were many whose
faith was so exceedingly strong,
even before Christ came, who could
not be kept from within the veil,
but truly saw with their eyes the
things which they had beheld with
an eye of faith, and they were glad.

20 And behold, we have seen in
this record that one of these was the
brother of Jared; for so great was
his faith in God, that when God put
forth his finger he could not hide
it from the sight of the brother of
Jared, because of his word which he
had spoken unto him, which word
he had obtained by faith.

21 And after the brother of Jared
had beheld the finger of the Lord,
because of the promise which the
brother of Jared had obtained by
faith, the Lord could not withhold
anything from his sight; wherefore
he showed him all things, for he could
no longer be kept without the veil.

22 And it is by faith that my fathers
have obtained the promise that
these things should come unto
their brethren through the Gentiles;
therefore the Lord hath commanded
me, yea, even Jesus Christ.

 

23 And I said unto him: Lord, the
Gentiles will mock at these things,
because of our weakness in writing;
for Lord thou hast made us mighty
in word by faith, but thou hast not
made us mighty in writing; for thou
hast made all this people that they
could speak much, because of the
Holy Ghost which thou hast given
them;

24 And thou hast made us that we
could write but little, because of
the awkwardness of our hands. Be-
hold, thou hast not made us mighty
in writing like unto the brother
of Jared, for thou madest him that
the things which he wrote were
mighty even as thou art, unto the
overpowering of man to read them.

25 Thou hast also made our words
powerful and great, even that we
cannot write them; wherefore, when
we write we behold our weakness,
and stumble because of the plac-
ing of our words; and I fear lest the
Gentiles shall mock at our words.

26 And when I had said this, the
Lord spake unto me, saying: Fools
>â€™mock, but they shall mourn; and
my grace is sufficient for the meek,
that they shall take no advantage
of your weakness;

27 And if men come unto me I
will show unto them their weak-
ness. I give unto men weakness
that they may be humble; and my
-grace is sufficient for all men that
humble themselves before me; for
if they humble themselves before
me, and have faith in me, then will
I make weak things become strong
unto them.
