3 And it came to pass that on the
morrow they started to go up, hav-
ing with them one Ammon, he be-
ing a strong and mighty man, and
a descendant of Zarahemla; and
he was also their leader.

4 And now, they knew not the
course they should travel in the
wilderness to go up to the land of
Lehi-Nephi; therefore they wan-
dered many days in the wilderness,
even forty days did they wander.

5 And when they had wandered
forty days they came to a hill, which
is north of the land of Shilom, and
there they pitched their tents.

6 And Ammon took three of his
brethren, and their names were
Amaleki, Helem, and Hem, and
they went down into the land of
’Nephi.

7 And behold, they met the king of
the people who were in the land of
Nephi, and in the land of Shilom;
and they were surrounded by the
king’s guard, and were taken, and
were bound, and were committed
to prison.

8 And it came to pass when they
had been in prison two days they
were again brought before the king,
and their bands were loosed; and
they stood before the king, and were
permitted, or rather commanded,
that they should answer the ques-
tions which he should ask them.

9 And he said unto them: Behold,
lam Limhi, the son of Noah, who
was the son of Zeniff, who came
up out of the land of Zarahemla
to inherit this land, which was
the land of their fathers, who was
made a king by the voice of the
people.

 

10 And now, I desire to know the
cause whereby ye were so bold as
to come near the walls of the city,
when I, myself, was with my guards
without the gate?

11 And now, for this cause have
I suffered that ye should be pre-
served, that I might inquire of you,
or else I should have caused that
my guards should have put you to
death. Ye are permitted to speak.

12 And now, when Ammon saw
that he was permitted to speak,
he went forth and bowed himself
before the king; and rising again
he said: O king, lam very thankful
before God this day that Iam yet
alive, and am permitted to speak;
and I will endeavor to speak with
boldness;

13 For lam assured that if ye had
known me ye would not have suf-
fered that I should have worn these
bands. For I am Ammon, and am
a descendant of Zarahemla, and
have come up out of the land of
Zarahemla to inquire concerning
our brethren, whom Zeniff brought
up out of that land.

14 And now, it came to pass that
after Limhi had heard the words of
Ammon, he was exceedingly glad,
and said: Now, I know of a surety
that my brethren who were in the
land of Zarahemla are yet alive.
And now, I will rejoice; and on the
morrow I will cause that my people
shall rejoice also.

15 For behold, we are in bondage
to the Lamanites, and are taxed
with a tax which is grievous to
be borne. And now, behold, our
brethren will deliver us out of our
’bondage, or out of the hands of the
