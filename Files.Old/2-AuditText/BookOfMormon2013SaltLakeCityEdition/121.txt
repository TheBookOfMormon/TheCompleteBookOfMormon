6 And then shall they rejoice; for
they shall know that it is a blessing
unto them from the hand of God;
and their scales of darkness shall
begin to fall from their eyes; and
many generations shall not pass
away among them, save they shall
be a pure and a delightsome people.

7 And it shall come to pass that
the Jews which are scattered also
shall begin to believe in Christ; and
they shall begin to gather in upon
the face of the land; and as many
as shall believe in Christ shall also
become a delightsome people.

8 And it shall come to pass that
the Lord God shall commence his
work among all nations, kindreds,
tongues, and people, to bring about
the restoration of his people upon
the earth.

9 And with righteousness shall the
Lord God judge the poor, and re-
prove with equity for the meek of
the earth. And he shall smite the
earth with the rod of his mouth; and
with the breath of his lips shall he
slay the wicked.

10 For the time speedily cometh
that the Lord God shall cause a
great division among the people,
and the wicked will he destroy; and
he will spare his people, yea, even
if it so be that he must destroy the
wicked by fire.

11 And righteousness shall be the
girdle of his loins, and faithfulness
the girdle of his reins.

12 And then shall the wolf dwell
with the lamb; and the leopard
shall lie down with the kid, and

 

the calf, and the young lion, and
the fatling, together; and a little
child shall lead them.

13 And the cow and the bear shall
feed; their young ones shall lie
down together; and the lion shall
eat straw like the ox.

14 And the sucking child shall
play on the hole of the asp, and the
weaned child shall put his hand on
the cockatriceâ€™s den.

15 They shall not hurt nor destroy
in all my holy mountain; for the
earth shall be full of the knowl-
edge of the Lord as the waters cover
the sea.

16 Wherefore, the things of all
nations shall be made known; yea,
all things shall be made known
unto the children of men.

17 There is nothing which is secret
save it shall be revealed; there is
no work of darkness save it shall be
made manifest in the light; and there
is nothing which is sealed upon
the earth save it shall be loosed.

18 Wherefore, all things which
have been revealed unto the chil-
dren of men shall at that day be
revealed; and Satan shall have power
over the hearts of the children of
men no more, for a long time. And
now, my beloved brethren, I make
an end of my sayings.

CHAPTER 31

Nephi tells why Christ was baptized.
Men must follow Christ, be baptized,
receive the Holy Ghost, and endure to
the end to be saved.Repentance and
