king of the Lamanites made an
oath unto them, that his people
should not slay them.

26 And also Limhi, being the son
of the king, having the kingdom
conferred upon him by the people,
made oath unto the king of the La-
manites that his people should pay
tribute unto him, even one half of
all they possessed.

27 And it came to pass that Limhi
began to establish the kingdom and
to establish peace among his people.

28 And the king of the Lamanites
set guards round about the land,
that he might keep the people of
Limhi in the land, that they might
not depart into the wilderness; and
he did support his guards out of the
tribute which he did receive from
the Nephites.

29 And now king Limhi did have
continual peace in his kingdom
for the space of two years, that the
Lamanites did not molest them nor
seek to destroy them.

CHAPTER 20

Some Lamanite daughters are abducted
by the priests of Noah.The Lamanites
wage war upon Limhi and his people.
The Lamanite hosts are repulsed and
pacified. About 145-123 B.c.

Now there was a place in Shemlon
where the daughters of the Laman-
ites did gather themselves together
to sing, and to dance, and to make
themselves merry.

2 And it came to pass that there
was one day a small number of
them gathered together to sing and
to dance.

3 And now the priests of king Noah,
being ashamed to return to the city
of Nephi, yea, and also fearing that
the people would slay them, there-
fore they durst not return to their
wives and their children.

 

4 And having tarried in the wil-
derness, and having discovered the
daughters of the Lamanites, they
laid and watched them;

5 And when there were but few of
them gathered together to dance,
they came forth out of their secret
places and took them and carried
them into the wilderness; yea,
twenty and four of the daughters
of the Lamanites they carried into
the wilderness.

6 And it came to pass that when the
Lamanites found that their daugh-
ters had been missing, they were
angry with the people of Limhi,
for they thought it was the people
of Limhi.

7 Therefore they sent their armies
forth; yea, even the king himself
went before his people; and they
went up to the land of Nephi to
destroy the people of Limhi.

8 And now Limhi had discov-
ered them from the tower, even
all their preparations for war did
he discover; therefore he gathered
his people together, and laid wait
for them in the fields and in the
forests.

9 And it came to pass that when
the Lamanites had come up, that the
people of Limhi began to fall upon
them from their waiting places, and
began to slay them.

10 And it came to pass that the
battle became exceedingly sore, for
they fought like lions for their prey.

11 And it came to pass that the
people of Limhi began to drive the
Lamanites before them; yet they
were not half so numerous as the
Lamanites. But they fought for
their lives, and for their wives,
and for their children; therefore
they exerted themselves and like
dragons did they fight.

12 And it came to pass that they
found the king of the Lamanites
