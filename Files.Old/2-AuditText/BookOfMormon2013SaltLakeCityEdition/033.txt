AND it came to pass that the angel
spake unto me, saying: Look! And
I looked and beheld many nations
and kingdoms.

2 And the angel said unto me: What
beholdest thou? And I said: I behold
many nations and kingdoms.

3 And he said unto me: These are
the nations and kingdoms of the
Gentiles.

4 And it came to pass that I saw
among the nations of the Gentiles
the formation of a great church.

5 And the angel said unto me:
Behold the formation of a church
which is most abominable above
all other churches, which slayeth
the saints of God, yea, and tortureth
them and bindeth them down, and
yoketh them with a yoke of iron, and
bringeth them down into captivity.

6 And it came to pass that I beheld
this great and abominable church;
and I saw the devil that he was the
founder of it.

7 And [also saw gold, and silver,
and silks, and scarlets, and fine-
twined linen, and all manner of
precious clothing; and I saw many
harlots.

8 And the angel spake unto me,
saying: Behold the gold, and the
silver, and the silks, and the scarlets,
and the fine-twined linen, and the
precious clothing, and the harlots,
are the desires of this great and
abominable church.

9 And also for the praise of the
world do they destroy the saints
of God, and bring them down into
captivity.

10 And it came to pass that I looked
and beheld many waters; and they

 

divided the Gentiles from the seed
of my brethren.

11 And it came to pass that the
angel said unto me: Behold the
wrath of God is upon the seed of
thy brethren.

12 And I looked and beheld a man
among the Gentiles, who was sepa-
rated from the seed of my brethren
by the many waters; and I beheld
the Spirit of God, that it came down
and wrought upon the man; and he
went forth upon the many waters,
even unto the seed of my brethren,
who were in the promised land.

13 And it came to pass that I beheld
the Spirit of God, that it wrought
upon other Gentiles; and they went
forth out of captivity, upon the
many waters.

14 And it came to pass that I beheld
many multitudes of the Gentiles
upon the land of promise; and I
beheld the wrath of God, that it
was upon the seed of my brethren;
and they were scattered before the
Gentiles and were smitten.

15 And I beheld the Spirit of the
Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles,
and they did prosper and obtain
the land for their inheritance; and
I beheld that they were white, and
exceedingly fair and beautiful,
like unto my people before they
were slain.

16 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles
who had gone forth out of captiv-
ity did humble themselves before
the Lord; and the power of the Lord
was with them.

17 And I beheld that their mother
Gentiles were gathered together
