Nephites and they shall write it;
and I shall also speak unto the
other tribes of the house of Israel,
which I have led away, and they
shall write it; and I shall also speak
unto all nations of the earth and
they shall write it.

13 And it shall come to pass that
the Jews shall have the words of
the Nephites, and the Nephites shall
have the words of the Jews; and the
Nephites and the Jews shall have
the words of the lost tribes of Is-
rael; and the lost tribes of Israel
shall have the words of the Neph-
ites and the Jews.

14 And it shall come to pass that my
people, which are of the house of
Israel, shall be gathered home unto
the lands of their possessions; and
my word also shall be gathered in
one. And I will show unto them that
fight against my word and against
my people, who are of the house
of Israel, that 1 am God, and that L
fcovenanted with Abraham that
I would remember his seed forever.

CHAPTER 30

Converted Gentiles will be numbered
with the covenant people.Many La-
manites and Jews will believe the word
and become delightsome.Israel will
be restored and the wicked destroyed.
About 559-545 B.C.

AND now behold, my beloved breth-
ren, I would speak unto you; for
1, Nephi, would not suffer that ye

 

should suppose that ye are more
righteous than the Gentiles shall
be. For behold, except ye shall keep
the commandments of God ye shall
all likewise perish; and because of
the words which have been spoken
ye need not suppose that the Gen-
tiles are utterly destroyed.

2 For behold, I say unto you that
as many of the Gentiles as will re-
pent are the covenant people of
the Lord; and as many of the Jews
as will not repent shall be cast off;
for the Lord covenanteth with none
save it be with them that repent
and believe in his Son, who is the
Holy One of Israel.

3 And now, I would prophesy some-
what more concerning the Jews and
the Gentiles. For after the book of
which I have spoken shall come
forth, and be written unto the Gen-
tiles, and sealed up again unto the
Lord, there shall be many which
shall believe the words which are
written; and they shall carry them
forth unto the remnant of our seed.

4 And then shall the remnant of
our seed know concerning us, how
that we came out from Jerusalem,
and that they are descendants of
the Jews.

5 And the gospel of Jesus Christ
shall be declared among them;
wherefore, they shall be restored
unto the knowledge of their fathers,
and also to the knowledge of Jesus
Christ, which was had among their
fathers.
