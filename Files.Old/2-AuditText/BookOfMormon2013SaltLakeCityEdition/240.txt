promised and firmly decreed, that
if ye will rebel against him that ye
shall utterly be destroyed from off
the face of the earth?

25 And now for this cause, that ye
may not be destroyed, the Lord has
sent his angel to visit many of his
people, declaring unto them that
they must go forth and cry mightily
unto this people, saying: Repent
ye, for the kingdom of heaven is
nigh at hand;

26 And not many days hence the
Son of God shall come in his glory;
and his glory shall be the glory of
the Only Begotten of the Father,
full of grace, equity, and truth,
full of patience, mercy, and long-
suffering, quick to hear the cries
of his people and to answer their
prayers.

27 And behold, he cometh to @re-
deem those who will be baptized
unto repentance, through faith on
his name.

28 Therefore, prepare ye the way
of the Lord, for the time is at hand
that all men shall reap a reward
of their works, according to that
which they have been.if they have
been righteous they shall reap the
salvation of their souls, according to
the power and deliverance of Jesus
Christ; and if they have been evil
they shall reap the damnation of
their souls, according to the power
and captivation of the devil.

29 Now behold, this is the voice of
the angel, crying unto the people.

30 And now, my beloved breth-
ren, for ye are my brethren, and ye
ought to be beloved, and ye ought
to bring forth works which are meet
for repentance, seeing that your
hearts have been grossly hardened
against the word of God, and see-

 

ing that ye are a lost and a fallen
people.

31 Now it came to pass that when
I, Alma, had spoken these words,
behold, the people were wroth
with me because I said unto them
that they were a hard-hearted and
a 4stiffnecked people.

32 And also because I said unto
them that they were a lost and a
fallen people they were angry with
me, and sought to lay their hands
upon me, that they might cast me
into prison.

33 But it came to pass that the
Lord did not suffer them that they
should take me at that time and
cast me into prison.

34 And it came to pass that Amu-
lek went and stood forth, and be-
gan to preach unto them also. And
now the words of Amulek are not
all written, nevertheless a part of
his words are written in this book.

CHAPTER 10

Lehi descended from Manasseh.Amu-
lek recounts the angelic command that
he care for Alma.The prayers of the
righteous cause the people to be spared.
Unrighteous lawyers and judges lay the
foundation of the destruction of the
people. About 82 B.c.

Now these are the words which
â€™Amulek preached unto the people
who were in the land of Ammoni-
hah, saying:

2 lam Amulek; 1am the son of Gid-
donah, who was the son of Ishmael,
who was a descendant of Aminadi;
and it was that same Aminadi who
interpreted the writing which
was upon the wall of the temple,
which was written by the finger
of God.
