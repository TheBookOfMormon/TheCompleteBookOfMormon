exercise a particle of faith, yea, even.
if ye can no more than desire to
believe, let this desire work in you,
even until ye believe in a manner
that ye can give place for a portion
of my words.

28 Now, we will compare the word
unto a seed. Now, if ye give place,
that a seed may be planted in your
heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or
a good seed, if ye do not cast it out
by your unbelief, that ye will resist
the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will
begin to swell within your breasts;
and when you feel these swell-
ing motions, ye will begin to say
within yourselves.It must needs be
that this is a good seed, or that the
word is good, for it beginneth to en-
large my soul; yea, it beginneth to
enlighten my understanding, yea,
it beginneth to be delicious to me.

29 Now behold, would not this in-
crease your faith? I say unto you,
Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown
up to a perfect knowledge.

30 But behold, as the seed swell-
eth, and sprouteth, and beginneth
to grow, then you must needs say
that the seed is good; for behold it
swelleth, and sprouteth, and begin-
neth to grow. And now, behold, will
not this strengthen your faith? Yea,
it will strengthen your faith: for ye
will say I know that this is a good
seed; for behold it sprouteth and
beginneth to grow.

31 And now, behold, are ye sure
that this is a good seed? I say unto
you, Yea; for every seed bringeth
forth unto its own likeness.

32 Therefore, if a seed groweth it
is good, but if it groweth not, be-
hold it is not good, therefore it is
cast away.

33 And now, behold, because ye
have tried the experiment, and
planted the seed, and it swelleth

 

and sprouteth, and beginneth to
grow, ye must needs know that the
seed is good.

34 And now, behold, is your knowl-
edge perfect? Yea, your knowledge
is perfect in that thing, and your
faith is dormant; and this because
you know, for ye know that the
word hath swelled your souls, and
ye also know that it hath sprouted
up, that your understanding doth
begin to be enlightened, and your
mind doth begin to expand.

35 O then, is not this real? I say
unto you, Yea, because it is light;
and whatsoever is light, is good,
because it is discernible, therefore
ye must know that it is good; and
now behold, after ye have tasted
this light is your knowledge perfect?

36 Behold I say unto you, Nay; nei-
ther must ye lay aside your faith, for
ye have only exercised your faith
to plant the seed that ye might try
the experiment to know if the seed
was good.

37 And behold, as the tree begin-
neth to grow, ye will say: Let us
nourish it with great care, that it
may get root, that it may grow up,
and bring forth fruit unto us. And
now behold, if ye nourish it with
much care it will get root, and grow
up, and bring forth fruit.

38 But if ye neglect the tree, and
take no thought for its nourishment,
behold it will not get any root; and
when the heat of the sun cometh
and scorcheth it, because it hath no
root it withers away, and ye pluck
it up and cast it out.

39 Now, this is not because the
seed was not good, neither is it be-
cause the fruit thereof would not
be desirable; but it is because your
ground is barren, and ye will not
nourish the tree, therefore ye can-
not have the fruit thereof.
