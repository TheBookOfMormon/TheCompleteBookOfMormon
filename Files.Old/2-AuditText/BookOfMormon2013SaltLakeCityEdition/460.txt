may repent and come unto me and
be baptized in my name and know
of the true points of my doctrine,
that they may be numbered among
my people, O house of Israel;

7 And when these things come
to pass that thy seed shall begin to
know these things.it shall be a
sign unto them, that they may know
that the work of the Father hath al-
ready commenced unto the fulfill-
ing of the covenant which he hath
made unto the people who are of
the house of Israel.

8 And when that day shall come, it
shall come to pass that kings shall
shut their mouths; for that which
had not been told them shall they
see; and that which they had not
heard shall they consider.

9 For in that day, for my sake shall
the Father work a work, which
shall be a great and a marvelous
work among them; and there shall
be among them those who will not
believe it, although a man shall de-
clare it unto them.

10 But behold, the life of my ser-
vant shall be in my hand; therefore
they shall not hurt him, although he
shall be marred because of them.
Yet I will heal him, for  will show unto
them that 'my wisdom is greater
than the cunning of the devil.

11 Therefore it shall come to pass
that whosoever will not believe in
my words, who am Jesus Christ,
which the Father shall cause him
to bring forth unto the Gentiles,
and shall give unto him power that
he shall bring them forth unto the
Gentiles, (it shall be done even as

from among my people who are of

12 And my people who are arem-
nant of Jacob shall be among the
Gentiles, yea, in the midst of them as
alion among the beasts of the for-
est, as a young lion among the flocks
of sheep, who, if he go through both
treadeth down and teareth in pieces,
and none can deliver.

13 Their hand shall be lifted up
upon their adversaries, and all their
enemies shall be cut off.

14 Yea, wo be unto the Gentiles
except they repent; for it shall
come to pass in that day, saith the
Father, that I will cut off thy horses
out of the midst of thee, and I will
destroy thy chariots;

15 And I will cut off the cities of
thy land, and throw down all thy
strongholds;

16 And I will cut off witchcrafts
out of thy land, and thou shalt have
no more soothsayers;

17 Thy graven images I will also
cut off, and thy standing images
out of the midst of thee, and thou
shalt no more worship the works
of thy hands;

18 And I will pluck up thy groves
out of the midst of thee; so will I
destroy thy cities.

19 And it shall come to pass that
all lyings, and deceivings, and en-
vyings, and strifes, and priestcrafts,
and whoredoms, shall be done away.

20 For it shall come to pass, saith
the Father, that at that day who-
soever will not repent and come
unto my Beloved Son, them will 1
