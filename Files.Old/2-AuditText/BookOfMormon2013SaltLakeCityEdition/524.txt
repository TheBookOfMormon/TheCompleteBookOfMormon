12 And it came to pass that he
fought with Lib, in which Lib did
smite upon his arm that he was
wounded; nevertheless, the army
of Coriantumr did press forward
upon Lib, that he fled to the bor-
ders upon the seashore.

13 And it came to pass that Cori-
antumr pursued him; and Lib gave
battle unto him upon the seashore.

14 And it came to pass that Lib
did smite the army of Coriantumr,
that they fled again to the wilder-
ness of Akish.

15 And it came to pass that Lib did
pursue him until he came to the
plains of Agosh. And Coriantumr
had taken all the people with him
as he fled before Lib in that quarter
of the land whither he fled.

16 And when he had come to the
plains of Agosh he gave battle unto
Lib, and he smote upon him until
he died; nevertheless, the brother
of Lib did come against Coriantumr
in the stead thereof, and the battle
became exceedingly sore, in the
which Coriantumr fled again be-
fore the army of the brother of Lib.

17 Now the name of the brother
of Lib was called Shiz. And it came
to pass that Shiz pursued after
Coriantumr, and he did overthrow
many cities, and he did slay both
women and children, and he did
burn the cities.

18 And there went a fear of Shiz
throughout all the land; yea, a cry
went forth throughout the land.
Who can stand before the army of
Shiz? Behold, he sweepeth the earth
before him!

19 And it came to pass that the
people began to flock together in
armies, throughout all the face of
the land.

20 And they were divided; and a
part of them fled to the army of
Shiz, and a part of them fled to the
army of Coriantumr.

21 And so great and lasting had

 

been the war, and so long had
been the scene of bloodshed and
carnage, that the whole face of the
land was covered with the bodies
of the dead.

22 And so swift and speedy was
the war that there was none left to
bury the dead, but they did march
forth from the shedding of blood
to the shedding of blood, leaving
the bodies of both men, women, and
children strewed upon the face of
the land, to become a prey to the
â€™worms of the flesh.

23 And the scent thereof went
forth upon the face of the land,
even upon all the face of the land;
wherefore the people became trou-
bled by day and by night, because
of the scent thereof.

24 Nevertheless, Shiz did not cease
to pursue Coriantumr; for he had
sworn to avenge himself upon Cori-
antumr of the blood of his brother,
who had been slain, and the word
of the Lord which came to Ether
that Coriantumr should not fall by
the sword.

25 And thus we see that the Lord
did visit them in the fulness of his
wrath, and their wickedness and
abominations had prepared a way
for their everlasting destruction.

26 And it came to pass that Shiz
did pursue Coriantumr eastward,
even to the borders by the seashore,
and there he gave battle unto Shiz
for the space of three days.

27 And so terrible was the destruc-
tion among the armies of Shiz that
the people began to be frightened,
and began to flee before the armies
of Coriantumr; and they fled to the
land of Corihor, and swept off the
inhabitants before them, all them
that would not join them.

28 And they pitched their tents
in the valley of Corihor; and Cori-
antumr pitched his tents in the
valley of Shurr. Now the valley of
Shurr was near the hill Comnor;
