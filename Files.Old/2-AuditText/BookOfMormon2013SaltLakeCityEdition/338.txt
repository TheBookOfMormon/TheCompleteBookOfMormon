the minds of the people to be faith-
ful unto the Lord their God.

8 Yea, he had been strengthening
the armies of the Nephites, and
erecting small forts, or places of
resort; throwing up banks of earth
round about to enclose his armies,
and also building walls of stone to
encircle them about, round about
their cities and the borders of their
lands; yea, all round about the land.

9 And in their weakest fortifica-
tions he did place the greater num-
ber of men; and thus he did fortify
and strengthen the land which was
possessed by the Nephites.

10 And thus he was preparing to
support their liberty, their lands,
their wives, and their children, and
their peace, and that they might live
unto the Lord their God, and that
they might maintain that which was
called by their enemies the cause
of Christians.

11 And Moroni was a strong and
a mighty man; he was a man of a
perfect understanding; yea, a man
that did not delight in bloodshed; a
man whose soul did joy in the lib-
erty and the freedom of his coun-
try, and his brethren from bondage
and slavery;

12 Yea, aman whose heart did swell
with thanksgiving to his God, for the
many privileges and blessings which
he bestowed upon his people; a man
who did labor exceedingly for the
welfare and safety of his people.

13 Yea, and he was a man who
was firm in the faith of Christ, and
he had sworn with an oath to de-
fend his people, his rights, and his
country, and his religion, even to
the loss of his blood.

14 Now the Nephites were taught

 

to defend themselves against their
enemies, even to the shedding of
blood if it were necessary; yea, and
they were also taught never to give
an offense, yea, and never to raise
the sword except it were against an
enemy, except it were to preserve
their lives.

15 And this was their faith, that by
so doing God would prosper them
in the land, or in other words, if they
were faithful in keeping the com-
mandments of God that he would
prosper them in the land; yea, warn
them to flee, or to prepare for war,
according to their danger;

16 And also, that God would make
it known unto them whither they
should go to defend themselves
against their enemies, and by so
doing, the Lord would deliver them;
and this was the faith of Moroni,
and his heart did glory in it; not
in the shedding of blood but in do-
ing good, in preserving his people,
yea, in keeping the commandments
of God, yea, and resisting iniquity.

17 Yea, verily, verily lsay unto you,
if all men had been, and were, and
ever would be, like unto Moroni,
behold, the very powers of hell
would have been shaken forever;
yea, the devil would never have
power over the hearts of the children
of men.

18 Behold, he was a man like unto
Ammon, the son of Mosiah, yea,
and even the other sons of Mosiah,
yea, and also Alma and his sons, for
they were all men of God.

19 Now behold, Helaman and his
brethren were no less serviceable
unto the people than was Moroni;
for they did preach the word of
God, and they did baptize unto
