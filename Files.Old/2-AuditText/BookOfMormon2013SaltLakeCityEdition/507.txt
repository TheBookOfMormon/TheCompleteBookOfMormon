humbly before the Lord; and they
were also taught from on high.

18 And it came to pass that they
began to spread upon the face of
the land, and to multiply and to till
the earth; and they did wax strong
in the land.

19 And the brother of Jared began
to be old, and saw that he must soon
go down to the grave; wherefore he
said unto Jared: Let us gather together
our people that we may number
them, that we may know of them
what they will desire of us before
we go down to our graves.

20 And accordingly the people
were gathered together. Now the
number of the sons and the daugh-
ters of the brother of Jared were
twenty and two souls; and the num-
ber of sons and daughters of Jared
were twelve, he having four sons.

21 And it came to pass that they
did number their people; and after
that they had numbered them, they
did desire of them the things which
they would that they should do be-
fore they went down to their graves.

22 And it came to pass that the
people desired of them that they
should anoint one of their sons to
be a king over them.

23 And now behold, this was griev-
ous unto them. And the brother of
Jared said unto them: Surely this
thing leadeth into captivity.

24 But Jared said unto his brother:
Suffer them that they may have a
king. And therefore he said unto
them: Choose ye out from among our
sons a king, even whom ye will.

25 And it came to pass that they
chose even the firstborn of the
brother of Jared; and his name was
Pagag. And it came to pass that he
refused and would not be their
king. And the people would that
his father should constrain him,
but his father would not; and he

 

commanded them that they should
constrain no man to be their king.

26 And it came to pass that they
chose all the brothers of Pagag, and
they would not.

27 And it came to pass that neither
would the sons of Jared, even all
Save it were one; and Orihah was
anointed to be king over the people.

28 And he began to reign, and the
people began to prosper; and they
became exceedingly rich.

29 And it came to pass that Jared
died, and his brother also.

30 And it came to pass that Ori-
hah did walk humbly before the
Lord, and did remember how great
things the Lord had done for his
father, and also taught his people
how great things the Lord had done
for their fathers.

CHAPTER 7

Orihah reigns in righteousness.Amid
usurpation and strife, the rival king-
doms of Shule and Cohor are set up.
Prophets condemn the wickedness and
idolatry of the people, who then repent.

AND it came to pass that Orihah did
execute judgment upon the land in
righteousness all his days, whose
days were exceedingly many.

2 And he begat sons and daughters;
yea, he begat thirty and one, among
whom were twenty and three sons.

3 And it came to pass that he also
begat Kib in his old age. And it
came to pass that Kib reigned in
his stead; and Kib begat Corihor.

4 And when Corihor was thirty and
two years old he rebelled against his
father, and went over and dwelt in
the land of Nehor; and he begat sons
and daughters, and they became
exceedingly fair; wherefore Corihor
drew away many people after him.

5 And when he had gathered to-
