marvelous works of Christ, ye
would, according to the words of
Christ, know that these things must
surely come.

34 And wo be unto him that will
not hearken unto the words of Jesus,
and also to them whom he hath
chosen and sent among them; for
whoso receiveth not the words of
Jesus and the words of those whom.
he hath sent receiveth not him; and
therefore he will not receive them
at the last day;

35 And it would be better for them
if they had not been born. For do ye
suppose that ye can get rid of the
justice of an offended God, who hath
been trampled under feet of men,
that thereby salvation might come?

36 And now behold, as I spake
concerning those whom the Lord
hath chosen, yea, even three who
were caught up into the heavens,
that I knew not whether they were
cleansed from mortality to im-
mortality.

37 But behold, since I wrote, Ihave
inquired of the Lord, and he hath
made it manifest unto me that there
must needs be a change wrought
upon their bodies, or else it needs
be that they must taste of death;

38 Therefore, that they might not
taste of death there was a change
wrought upon their bodies, that
they might not suffer pain nor
sorrow save it were for the sins of
the world.

39 Now this change was not equal
to that which shall take place at the
last day; but there was a change
wrought upon them, insomuch
that Satan could have no power
over them, that he could not tempt
them; and they were sanctified in
the flesh, that they were holy, and

 

that the powers of the earth could
not hold them.

40 And in this state they were to
remain until the judgment day of
Christ; and at that day they were
to receive a greater change, and to
be received into the kingdom of
the Father to go no more out, but
to dwell with God eternally in the
heavens.

CHAPTER 29

The coming forth of the Book of Mor-
mon is a sign that the Lord has com-
menced to gather Israel and fulfill
His covenants.Those who reject His
latter-day revelations and gifts will be
cursed. About A.D. 34-35.

AND now behold, I say unto you
that when the Lord shall see fit, in
his wisdom, that these sayings shall
come unto the Gentiles according
to his word, then ye may know that
the covenant which the Father
hath made with the children of Is-
rael, concerning their restoration
to the lands of their inheritance,
is already beginning to be fulfilled.

2 And ye may know that the words
of the Lord, which have been spo-
ken by the holy prophets, shall all
be fulfilled; and ye need not say
that the Lord delays his coming
unto the children of Israel.

3 And ye need not imagine in
your hearts that the words which
have been spoken are vain, for be-
hold, the Lord will remember his
covenant which he hath made unto
his people of the house of Israel.

4 And when ye shall see these say-
ings coming forth among you, then
ye need not any longer spurn at the
doings of the Lord, for the sword
of his justice is in his right hand;
