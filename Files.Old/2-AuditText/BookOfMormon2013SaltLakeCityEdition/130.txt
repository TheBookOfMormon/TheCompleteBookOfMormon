to clothe the naked, and to feed the
hungry, and to liberate the captive,
and administer relief to the sick
and the afflicted.

20 And now, my brethren, I have
spoken unto you concerning pride;
and those of you which have af-
flicted your neighbor, and perse-
cuted him because ye were proud in
your hearts, of the things which God
hath given you, what say ye of it?

21 Do ye not suppose that such
things are abominable unto him
who created all flesh? And the one
being is as precious in his sight as
the other. And all flesh is of the
dust; and for the selfsame end hath
he created them, that they should
keep his commandments and glo-
rify him forever.

22 And now I make an end of
speaking unto you concerning this
pride. And were it not that I must
speak unto you concerning a grosser
crime, my heart would rejoice ex-
ceedingly because of you.

23 But the word of God burdens
me because of your grosser crimes.
For behold, thus saith the Lord: This
people begin to wax in iniquity; they
understand not the scriptures, for
they seek to excuse themselves in
committing whoredoms, because of
the things which were written con-
cerning David, and Solomon his son.

24 Behold, David and Solomon
truly had many wives and concu-
bines, which thing was abominable
before me, saith the Lord.

25 Wherefore, thus saith the Lord,
I have led this people forth out of
the land of Jerusalem, by the power
of mine arm, that I might raise up

 

unto me a righteous branch from
the fruit of the loins of Joseph.

26 Wherefore, I the Lord God will
not suffer that this people shall do
like unto them of old.

27 Wherefore, my brethren, hear
me, and hearken to the word of
the Lord: For there shall not any
man among you have save it be
â€™one wife; and concubines he shall
have none;

28 For I, the Lord God, delight in
the chastity of women. And whore-
doms are an abomination before
me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts.

29 Wherefore, this people shall
keep my commandments, saith the
Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land
for their sakes.

30 For if I will, saith the Lord of
Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will
command my people; otherwise
they shall hearken unto these things.

31 For behold, I, the Lord, have
seen the sorrow, and heard the
mourning of the daughters of my
people in the land of Jerusalem,
yea, and in all the lands of my peo-
ple, because of the wickedness and
abominations of their husbands.

32 And I will not suffer, saith the
Lord of Hosts, that the cries of the
fair daughters of this people, which
[have led out of the land of Jerusa-
lem, shall come up unto me against
the men of my people, saith the
Lord of Hosts.

33 For they shall not lead away
captive the daughters of my people
because of their tenderness, save I
shall visit them with a sore curse,
even unto destruction; for they
shall not commit whoredoms, like
