is my doctrine, that such things
should be done away.

31 Behold, verily, verily, I say
unto you, I will declare unto you
my doctrine.

32 And this is my doctrine, and
it is the doctrine which the Father
hath given unto me; and I bear
record of the Father, and the Father
beareth record of me, and the Holy
Ghost beareth record of the Father
and me; and I bear record that the
Father commandeth all men, every-
where, to repent and believe in me.

33 And whoso believeth in me,
and is baptized, the same shall be
saved; and they are they who shall
inherit the kingdom of God.

34 And whoso believeth not in
me, and is not baptized, shall be
damned.

35 Verily, verily,  say unto you,
that this is my doctrine, and I bear
record of it from the Father; and
whoso believeth in me believeth
in the Father also; and unto him
will the Father bear record of me,
for he will visit him with fire and
with the Holy Ghost.

36 And thus will the Father bear
record of me, and the Holy Ghost
will bear record unto him of the
Father and me; for the Father, and
I, and the Holy Ghost are one.

37 And again I say unto you, ye
must repent, and become as a little
child, and be baptized in my name,
or ye can in nowise receive these
things.

38 And again I say unto you, ye
must repent, and be baptized in my

 

name, and become as a little child,
or ye can in nowise inherit the
kingdom of God.

39 Verily, verily, I say unto you,
that this is my doctrine, and whoso
â€™buildeth upon this buildeth upon
my rock, and the gates of hell shall
not prevail against them.

40 And whoso shall declare more
or less than this, and establish it
for my doctrine, the same cometh
of evil, and is not built upon my
rock; but he buildeth upon a sandy
foundation, and the gates of hell
stand open to receive such when
the floods come and the winds beat
upon them.

41 Therefore, go forth unto this
people, and declare the words which
I have spoken, unto the ends of
the earth.

CHAPTER 12

Jesus calls and commissions the twelve
disciples.He delivers to the Nephites a
discourse similar to the Sermon on the
Mount.He speaks the Beatitudes.His
teachings transcend and take prece-
dence over the law of Moses.Men are
commanded to be perfect even as He
and His Father are perfect.Compare
Matthew 5. About A.D. 34.

AND it came to pass that when
Jesus had spoken these words unto
Nephi, and to those who had been
called, (now the number of them
who had been called, and received
power and authority to baptize, was
twelve) and behold, he stretched
forth his hand unto the multitude,
