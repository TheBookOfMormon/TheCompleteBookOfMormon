wrath, with mighty threatenings to
destroy his church.

19 Oh then, why did he not con-
sign us to an awful destruction, yea,
why did he not let the sword of his
justice fall upon us, and doom us
to eternal despair?

20 Oh, my soul, almost as it were,
fleeth at the thought. Behold, he did
not exercise his justice upon us, but
in his great mercy hath brought us
over that everlasting gulf of death
and misery, even to the salvation
of our souls.

21 And now behold, my brethren,
what natural man is there that
knoweth these things? I say unto
you, there is none that knoweth
these things, save it be the penitent.

22 Yea, he that repenteth and ex-
erciseth faith, and bringeth forth
good works, and prayeth contin-
ually without ceasing.unto such
it is given to know the mysteries
of God; yea, unto such it shall be
4given to reveal things which never
have been revealed; yea, and it
shall be given unto such to bring
thousands of souls to repentance,
even as it has been given unto
us to bring these our brethren to
repentance.

23 Now do ye remember, my breth-
ren, that we said unto our brethren
in the land of Zarahemla, we go up
to the land of Nephi, to preach unto
our brethren, the Lamanites, and
they laughed us to scorn?

24 For they said unto us: Do ye sup-
pose that ye can bring the Laman-
ites to the knowledge of the truth?
Do ye suppose that ye can convince
the Lamanites of the incorrectness
of the traditions of their fathers,

 

as stiffnecked a people as they are;
whose hearts delight in the shed-
ding of blood; whose days have
been spent in the grossest iniquity;
whose ways have been the ways of
a transgressor from the beginning?
Now my brethren, ye remember that
this was their language.

25 And moreover they did say: Let
us take up arms against them, that
we destroy them and their iniquity
out of the land, lest they overrun
us and destroy us.

26 But behold, my beloved breth-
ren, we came into the wilderness
not with the intent to destroy our
brethren, but with the intent that
perhaps we might save some few
of their souls.

27 Now when our hearts were de-
pressed, and we were about to turn
back, behold, the Lord comforted
us, and said: Go amongst thy breth-
ren, the Lamanites, and bear with
patience thine afflictions, and I
will give unto you success.

28 And now behold, we have come,
and been forth amongst them; and
we have been patient in our suffer-
ings, and we have suffered every pri-
vation; yea, we have traveled from
house to house, relying upon the
mercies of the world.not upon
the mercies of the world alone but
upon the mercies of God.

29 And we have entered into their
houses and taught them, and we
have taught them in their streets;
yea, and we have taught them upon
their hills; and we have also entered
into their temples and their syna-
gogues and taught them; and we
have been cast out, and mocked,
and spit upon, and smote upon our
