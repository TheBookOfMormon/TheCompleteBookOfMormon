might have received in the land,
for the Gentiles who shall possess
the land.

20 But behold, it shall come to
pass that they shall be driven and
scattered by the Gentiles; and after
they have been driven and scattered
by the Gentiles, behold, then will
the Lord remember the covenant
which he made unto Abraham and
unto all the house of Israel.

21 And also the Lord will remem-
ber the prayers of the righteous,
which have been put up unto him
for them.

22 And then, O ye Gentiles, how
can ye stand before the power of.
God, except ye shall repent and
turn from your evil ways?

23 Know ye not that ye are in the
hands of God? Know ye not that
he hath all power, and at his great
command the earth shall be rolled
together as a scroll?

24 Therefore, repent ye, and hum-
ble yourselves before him, lest he
shall come out in justice against
you.lest a remnant of the seed of
Jacob shall go forth among you as
a lion, and tear you in pieces, and
there is none to deliver.

CHAPTER 6

The Nephites gather to the land of Cu-
morah for the final battles.Mormon
hides the sacred records in the hill Cu-
morah.The Lamanites are victorious,
and the Nephite nation is destroyed.
Hundreds of thousands are slain with
the sword. About A.D. 385.

AND now  finish my record concern-
ing the destruction of my people,
the Nephites. And it came to pass

 

that we did march forth before the
Lamanites.

2 And I, Mormon, wrote an epis-
tle unto the king of the Lamanites,
and desired of him that he would
grant unto us that we might gather
together our people unto the land
of Cumorah, by a hill which was
called Cumorah, and there we could
give them battle.

3 And it came to pass that the king
of the Lamanites did grant unto me
the thing which I desired.

4 And it came to pass that we did
march forth to the land of Cumorah,
and we did pitch our tents around
about the hill Cumorah; and it was in
a land of many waters, rivers, and
fountains; and here we had hope to
gain advantage over the Lamanites.

5 And when three hundred and
eighty and four years had passed
away, we had gathered in all the
remainder of our people unto the
land of Cumorah.

6 And it came to pass that when
we had gathered in all our people
in one to the land of Cumorah, be-
hold I, Mormon, began to be old; and.
knowing it to be the last struggle of
my people, and having been com-
manded of the Lord that I should
not suffer the records which had
been handed down by our fathers,
which were sacred, to fall into the
hands of the Lamanites, (for the
Lamanites would destroy them)
therefore I made this record out
of the plates of Nephi, and hid up
in the hill Cumorah all the records
which had been entrusted to me by
the hand of the Lord, save it were
these few plates which I gave unto
my son fMoroni.
