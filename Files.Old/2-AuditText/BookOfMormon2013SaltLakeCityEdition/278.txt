preach unto us, and to convince us of.
the traditions of our wicked fathers.

8 And behold, I thank my great
God that he has given us a portion
of his Spirit to soften our hearts, that
we have opened a correspondence
with these brethren, the Nephites.

9 And behold,  also thank my God,
that by opening this correspon-
dence we have been convinced of
our sins, and of the many murders
which we have committed.

10 And  also thank my God, yea,
my great God, that he hath granted
unto us that we might repent of
these things, and also that he hath
forgiven us of those our many sins
and murders which we have com-
mitted, and taken away the guilt
from our hearts, through the mer-
its of his Son.

11 And now behold, my brethren,
since it has been all that we could
do (as we were the most lost of all
mankind) to repent of all our sins
and the many murders which we
have committed, and to get God to
take them away from our hearts,
for it was all we could do to repent
sufficiently before God that he
would take away our stain.

12 Now, my best beloved breth-
ren, since God hath taken away
our stains, and our swords have be-
come bright, then let us stain our
swords no more with the blood of
our brethren.

13 Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let
us retain our swords that they be
not stained with the blood of our
brethren; for perhaps, if we should
stain our swords again they can no
more be washed bright through
the blood of the Son of our great
God, which shall be shed for the
atonement of our sins.

14 And the great God has had
mercy on us, and made these things

 

known unto us that we might not
perish; yea, and he has made these
things known unto us beforehand,
because he loveth our souls as well
as he loveth our children; therefore,
in his mercy he doth visit us by his
angels, that the plan of salvation
might be made known unto us as
well as unto future generations.

15 Oh, how merciful is our God!
And now behold, since it has been
as much as we could do to get our
stains taken away from us, and our
swords are made bright, let us chide
them away that they may be kept
bright, as a testimony to our God at
the last day, or at the day that we
shall be brought to stand before
him to be judged, that we have not
stained our swords in the blood of
our brethren since he imparted
his word unto us and has made us
’clean thereby.

16 And now, my brethren, if our
brethren seek to destroy us, behold,
we will hide away our swords, yea,
even we will bury them deep in the
earth, that they may be kept bright,
as a testimony that we have never
used them, at the last day; and if
our brethren destroy us, behold,
we shall go to our God and shall
be saved.

17 And now it came to pass that
when the king had made an end of
these sayings, and all the people
were assembled together, they took
their swords, and all the weapons
which were used for the shedding
of man’s blood, and they did bury
them up deep in the earth.

18 And this they did, it being in
their view a testimony to God, and
also to men, that they never would
use weapons again for the shedding
of man’s blood; and this they did,
vouching and covenanting with
God, that rather than shed the
