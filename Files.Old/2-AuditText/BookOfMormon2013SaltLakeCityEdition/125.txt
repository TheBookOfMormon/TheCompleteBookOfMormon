CHAPTER 33

Nephi’s words are true.They testify
of Christ.Those who believe in Christ
will believe Nephi’s words, which will
stand as a witness before the judgment
bar. About 559-545 B.c.

AND now I, Nephi, cannot write all
the things which were taught among
my people; neither am I mighty
in writing, like unto speaking;
for when a man speaketh by the
power of the Holy Ghost the power
of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto
the hearts of the children of men.

2 But behold, there are many
that harden their hearts against
the Holy Spirit, that it hath no
place in them; wherefore, they cast
many things away which are writ-
ten and esteem them as things of
naught.

3 But I, Nephi, have written what
Ihave written, and I esteem it as of
great worth, and especially unto
my people. For I pray continually
for them by day, and mine eyes
water my pillow by night, because
of them; and I cry unto my God in
faith, and I know that he will hear
my cry.

4 And I know that the Lord God
will consecrate my prayers for the

 

gain of my people. And the words
which I have written in weakness
will be made strong unto them; for
it persuadeth them to do good; it
maketh known unto them of their
fathers; and it speaketh of Jesus,
and persuadeth them to believe
in him, and to endure to the end,
which is life eternal.

5 And it speaketh harshly against
sin, according to the plainness of
the truth; wherefore, no man will
be angry at the words which I have
written save he shall be of the spirit
of the devil.

61 glory in plainness; I glory in
truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he
hath redeemed my soul from hell.

71 have charity for my people,
and great faith in Christ that I
shall meet many souls spotless at
his judgment-seat.

81 have charity for the Jew.I
say Jew, because I mean them from.
whence I came.

9 Lalso have charity for the Gen-
tiles. But behold, for none of these
can  hope except they shall be rec-
onciled unto Christ, and enter into
the narrow gate, and walk in the
fstrait path which leads to life, and
continue in the path until the end
of the day of probation.

10 And now, my beloved brethren,
and also Jew, and all ye ends of the
earth, hearken unto these words and
’believe in Christ; and if ye believe
not in these words believe in Christ.
