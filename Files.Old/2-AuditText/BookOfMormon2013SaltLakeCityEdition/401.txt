unto thee according to thy word,
for thou shalt not ask that which
is contrary to my will.

6 Behold, thou art Nephi, and I
am God. Behold, I declare it unto
thee in the presence of mine angels,
that ye shall have power over this
people, and shall smite the earth
with famine, and with pestilence,
and destruction, according to the
wickedness of this people.

7 Behold, I give unto you power,
that whatsoever ye shall seal on
earth shall be sealed in heaven;
and whatsoever ye shall loose on
earth shall be loosed in heaven; and
thus shall ye have power among
this people.

8 And thus, if ye shall say unto this
temple it shall be rent in twain, it
shall be done.

9 And if ye shall say unto this
mountain, Be thou cast down and
become smooth, it shall be done.

10 And behold, if ye shall say that
God shall smite this people, it shall
come to pass.

11 And now behold, I command
you, that ye shall go and declare
unto this people, that thus saith the
Lord God, who is the Almighty: Ex-
cept ye repent ye shall be smitten,
even unto destruction.

12 And behold, now it came to
pass that when the Lord had spoken
these words unto Nephi, he did stop
and did not go unto his own house,
but did return unto the multitudes
who were scattered about upon
the face of the land, and began to
declare unto them the word of the
Lord which had been spoken unto
him, concerning their destruction
if they did not repent.

13 Now behold, notwithstanding
that great miracle which Nephi
had done in telling them concern-
ing the death of the chief judge,

 

they did harden their hearts and
did not hearken unto the words of
the Lord.

14 Therefore Nephi did declare
unto them the word of the Lord,
saying: Except ye repent, thus saith
the Lord, ye shall be smitten even
unto destruction.

15 And it came to pass that when
Nephi had declared unto them the
word, behold, they did still harden
their hearts and would not hearken
unto his words; therefore they did
4revile against him, and did seek to
lay their hands upon him that they
might cast him into prison.

16 But behold, the power of God
was with him, and they could not
take him to cast him into prison,
for he was taken by the Spirit and
conveyed away out of the midst
of them.

17 And it came to pass that thus
he did go forth in the Spirit, from
multitude to multitude, declaring
the word of God, even until he had
declared it unto them all, or sent it
forth among all the people.

18 And it came to pass that they
would not hearken unto his words;
and there began to be contentions,
insomuch that they were divided
against themselves and began to
slay one another with the sword.

19 And thus ended the seventy and
first year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi.
