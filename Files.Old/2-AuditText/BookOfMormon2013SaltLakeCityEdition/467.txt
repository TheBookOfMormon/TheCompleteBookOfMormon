and utter marvelous things; and the
things which they did utter were
forbidden that there should not
any man write them.

17 And it came to pass that the
disciples whom Jesus had chosen
began from that time forth to bap-
tize and to teach as many as did
come unto them; and as many as
were baptized in the name of Jesus
were filled with the Holy Ghost.

18 And many of them saw and
heard unspeakable things, which
are not lawful to be written.

19 And they taught, and did min-
ister one to another; and they had
ball things common among them,
every man dealing justly, one with
another.

20 And it came to pass that they
did do all things even as Jesus had
commanded them.

21 And they who were baptized
in the name of Jesus were called
the church of Christ.

CHAPTER 27

Jesus commands them to call the Church
in His name.His mission and atoning
sacrifice constitute His gospel.Men are
commanded to repent and be baptized
that they may be sanctified by the Holy
Ghost.They are to be even as Jesus is.
About A.D. 34-35.

AND it came to pass that as the dis-
ciples of Jesus were journeying and
were preaching the things which
they had both heard and seen, and
were baptizing in the name of Jesus,
it came to pass that the disciples were
gathered together and were united
in mighty prayer and fasting.

2 And Jesus again showed himself
unto them, for they were praying

 

unto the Father in his name; and
Jesus came and stood in the midst
of them, and said unto them: What
will ye that I shall give unto you?

3 And they said unto him: Lord,
we will that thou wouldst tell us the
name whereby we shall call this
church; for there are disputations
among the people concerning this
matter.

4 And the Lord said unto them:
Verily, verily, I say unto you, why
is it that the people should murmur
and dispute because of this thing?

5 Have they not read the scriptures,
which say ye must take upon you
the name of Christ, which is my
name? For by this name shall ye be
called at the last day;

6 And whoso taketh upon him my
name, and endureth to the end, the
same shall be saved at the last day.

7 Therefore, whatsoever ye shall
do, ye shall do it in my name; there-
fore ye shall call the church in my
name; and ye shall call upon the
Father in my name that he will bless
the church for my sake.

8 And how be it my church save
it be called in my name? For if a
church be called in Moses’ name then.
it be Moses’ church; or if it be called
in the name of a man then it be the
church of a man; but if it be called
in my name then it is my church,
if it so be that they are built upon
my gospel.

9 Verily I say unto you, that ye are
built upon my gospel; therefore ye
shall call whatsoever things ye do
call, in my name; therefore if ye call
upon the Father, for the church, if
it be in my name the Father will
hear you;

10 And if it so be that the church
