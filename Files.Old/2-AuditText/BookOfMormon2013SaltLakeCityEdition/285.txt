against their brethren, the people
of Anti-Nephi-Lehi; therefore they
began again to destroy them.

3 Now this people again refused to
take their arms, and they suffered
themselves to be slain according to
the desires of their enemies.

4 Now when Ammon and his breth-
ren saw this work of destruction
among those whom they so dearly
beloved, and among those who had
so dearly beloved them.for they
were treated as though they were
angels sent from God to save them
from everlasting destruction.
therefore, when Ammon and his
brethren saw this great work of
destruction, they were moved with
compassion, and they said unto
the king:

5 Let us gather together this peo-
ple of the Lord, and let us go down
to the land of Zarahemla to our
brethren the Nephites, and flee out
of the hands of our enemies, that
we be not destroyed.

6 But the king said unto them: Be-
hold, the Nephites will destroy us,
because of the many murders and
sins we have committed against
them.

7 And Ammon said: I will go and
inquire of the Lord, and if he say
unto us, go down unto our breth-
ren, will ye go?

8 And the king said unto him: Yea,
if the Lord saith unto us go, we will
go down unto our brethren, and
we will be their slaves until we re-
pair unto them the many murders
and sins which we have committed
against them.

9 But Ammon said unto him: It
is against the law of our brethren,
which was established by my father,
that there should be any slaves
among them; therefore let us go
down and rely upon the mercies
of our brethren.

 

10 But the king said unto him: In-
quire of the Lord, and if he saith
unto us go, we will go; otherwise
we will perish in the land.

11 And it came to pass that Am-
mon went and inquired of the Lord,
and the Lord said unto him:

12 Get this people out of this
land, that they perish not; for Sa-
tan has great hold on the hearts of
the Amalekites, who do stir up the
Lamanites to anger against their
brethren to slay them; therefore get
thee out of this land; and blessed
are this people in this generation,
for I will preserve them.

13 And now it came to pass that
Ammon went and told the king all
the words which the Lord had said
unto him.

14 And they gathered together all
their people, yea, all the people of
the Lord, and did gather together
all their flocks and herds, and de-
parted out of the land, and came
into the wilderness which divided
the land of Nephi from the land of
Zarahemla, and came over near the
borders of the land.

15 And it came to pass that Am-
mon said unto them: Behold, I and
my brethren will go forth into the
land of Zarahemla, and ye shall re-
main here until we return; and we
will try the hearts of our brethren,
whether they will that ye shall come
into their land.

16 And it came to pass that as
Ammon was going forth into the
land, that he and his brethren met
Alma, over in the place of which
has been spoken; and behold, this
was a joyful meeting.

17 Now the joy of Ammon was
so great even that he was full; yea,
he was swallowed up in the joy of
his God, even to the exhausting
of his strength; and he fell again
to the earth.
