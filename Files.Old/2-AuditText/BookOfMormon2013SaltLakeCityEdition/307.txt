’deliver them except it was the
God of Abraham, and the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and
he surely did deliver them in their
afflictions.

3 And now, O my son Helaman,
behold, thou art in thy youth, and
therefore, I beseech of thee that
thou wilt hear my words and learn
of me; for I do know that whosoever
shall put their trust in God shall be
supported in their trials, and their
troubles, and their afflictions, and
shall be lifted up at the last day.

4 And I would not that ye think
that I know of myself.not of the
temporal but of the spiritual, not of
the carnal mind but of God.

5 Now, behold, I say unto you, if I
had not been born of God I should
’not have known these things; but
God has, by the mouth of his holy
angel, made these things known
unto me, not of any worthiness
of myself;

6 For I went about with the sons
of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the
church of God; but behold, God sent
his holy angel to stop us by the way.

7 And behold, he spake unto us,
as it were the voice of thunder,
and the whole earth did tremble
beneath our feet; and we all fell to
the earth, for the fear of the Lord
came upon us.

8 But behold, the voice said unto
me: Arise. And I arose and stood
up, and beheld the angel.

9 And he said unto me: If thou
wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no
more to destroy the church of God.

10 And it came to pass that I fell to

 

the earth; and it was for the space
of three days and three nights
that I could not open my mouth,
neither had I the use of my limbs.

11 And the angel spake more
things unto me, which were heard
by my brethren, but I did not hear
them; for when I heard the words.
If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself,
seek no more to destroy the church
of God.I was struck with such great
fear and amazement lest perhaps I
should be destroyed, that I fell to
the earth and I did hear no more.

12 But I was racked with eternal
’torment, for my soul was harrowed
up to the greatest degree and racked
with all my sins.

13 Yea, 1 did remember all my sins
and iniquities, for which I was tor-
mented with the pains of hell; yea,
I saw that I had rebelled against
my God, and that [had not kept his
holy commandments.

14 Yea, and I had murdered many
of his children, or rather led them
away unto destruction; yea, and in
fine so great had been my iniqui-
ties, that the very thought of com-
ing into the presence of my God
did rack my soul with inexpressible
horror.

15 Oh, thought I, that I could be
banished and become extinct both
soul and body, that I might not be
brought to stand in the presence of
my God, to be judged of my deeds.

16 And now, for three days and
for three nights was I racked, even
with the pains of a damned soul.

17 And it came to pass that as  was
thus racked with torment, while I
