15 And now it came to pass that
the people of Nephi, under the reign
of the second king, began to grow
hard in their hearts, and indulge
themselves somewhat in wicked
practices, such as like unto David of
old desiring many wives and con-
cubines, and also Solomon, his son.

16 Yea, and they also began to
search much gold and silver, and
began to be lifted up somewhat
in pride.

17 Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto
them these words as I taught them
in the temple, having first obtained
mine errand from the Lord.

18 For I, Jacob, and my brother Jo-
seph had been consecrated priests
and teachers of this people, by the
hand of Nephi.

19 And we did magnify our office
unto the Lord, taking upon us the
â€™responsibility, answering the sins
of the people upon our own heads if
we did not teach them the word of
God with all diligence; wherefore,
by laboring with our might their
blood might not come upon our
garments; otherwise their blood
would come upon our garments,
and we would not be found spot-
less at the last day.

CHAPTER 2

Jacob denounces the love of riches,
pride, and unchastity.Men may seek
riches to help their fellowmen.The
Lord commands that no man among
the Nephites may have more than one

of women. About 544-421 B.c.

 

THE words which Jacob, the
brother of Nephi, spake unto the
people of Nephi, after the death
of Nephi:

2 Now, my beloved brethren, I,
Jacob, according to the responsi-
bility which I am under to God, to
bmagnify mine office with sober-
ness, and that I might rid my gar-
ments of your sins, I come up into
the temple this day that I might
declare unto you the word of God.

3 And ye yourselves know that I
have hitherto been diligent in the
office of my calling; but I this day
am weighed down with much more
desire and anxiety for the welfare
of your souls than I have hitherto
been.

4 For behold, as yet, ye have been
obedient unto the word of the Lord,
which I have given unto you.

5 But behold, hearken ye unto
me, and know that by the help of
the all-powerful Creator of heaven
and earth I can tell you concerning
your thoughts, how that ye are be-
ginning to labor in sin, which sin
appeareth very abominable unto
me, yea, and abominable unto God.

6 Yea, it grieveth my soul and
causeth me to shrink with shame
before the presence of my Maker,
that I must testify unto you concern-
ing the wickedness of your hearts.

7 And also it grieveth me that
I must use so much boldness of
speech concerning you, before your
wives and your children, many of
whose feelings are exceedingly
tender and chaste and delicate
