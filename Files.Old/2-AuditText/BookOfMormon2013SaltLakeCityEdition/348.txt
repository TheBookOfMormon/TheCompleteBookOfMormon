had overpowered them because
of their much fatigue, which was
caused by the labors and heat of
the day.

34 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum stole privily into the tent of
the king, and put a javelin to his
heart; and he did cause the death
of the king immediately that he did
not awake his servants.

35 And he returned again privily
to his own camp, and behold, his
men were asleep, and he awoke
them and told them all the things
that he had done.

36 And he caused that his armies
should stand in readiness, lest
the Lamanites had awakened and
should come upon them.

37 And thus endeth the twenty and
fifth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi; and thus
endeth the days of Amalickiah.

CHAPTER 52

Ammoron succeeds Amalickiah as king
of the Lamanites.Moroni, Teancum,
and Lehi lead the Nephites in a victo-
rious war against the Lamanites.The
city of Mulek is retaken, and Jacob the
Zoramite is slain. About 66-64 B.C.

AND now, it came to pass in the
twenty and sixth year of the reign of
the judges over the people of Nephi,
behold, when the Lamanites awoke
on the first morning of the first
month, behold, they found Amal-
ickiah was dead in his own tent;
and they also saw that Teancum
was ready to give them battle on
that day.

2 And now, when the Lamanites
saw this they were affrighted; and
they abandoned their design in
marching into the land northward,
and retreated with all their army
into the city of Mulek, and sought
protection in their fortifications.

 

3 And it came to pass that the
brother of Amalickiah was ap-
pointed king over the people; and
his name was Ammoron; thus king
Ammoron, the brother of king Amal-
ickiah, was appointed to reign in
his stead.

4 And it came to pass that he did
command that his people should
maintain those cities, which they
had taken by the shedding of blood;
for they had not taken any cities
save they had lost much blood.

5 And now, Teancum saw that
the Lamanites were determined
to maintain those cities which
they had taken, and those parts of
the land which they had obtained
possession of; and also seeing the
enormity of their number, Teancum
thought it was not expedient that
he should attempt to attack them in
their forts.

6 But he kept his men round about,
as if making preparations for war;
yea, and truly he was preparing to
defend himself against them, by
casting up walls round about and
preparing places of resort.

7 And it came to pass that he kept
thus preparing for war until Moroni
had sent a large number of men to
strengthen his army.

8 And Moroni also sent orders unto
him that he should retain all the
prisoners who fell into his hands; for
as the Lamanites had taken many
prisoners, that he should retain all
the prisoners of the Lamanites as
a ransom for those whom the La-
manites had taken.

9 And he also sent orders unto
him that he should fortify the land
Bountiful, and secure the narrow
pass which led into the land north-
ward, lest the Lamanites should
obtain that point and should have
power to harass them on every
side.
