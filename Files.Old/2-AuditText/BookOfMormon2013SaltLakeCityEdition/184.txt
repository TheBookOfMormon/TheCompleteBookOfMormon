5 But he was wounded for our
transgressions, he was bruised for
our iniquities; the chastisement of
our peace was upon him; and with
his stripes we are healed.

6 All we, like sheep, have gone
astray; we have turned every one
to his own way; and the Lord hath
laid on him the iniquities of us all.

7 He was oppressed, and he was
afflicted, yet he opened not his
mouth; he is brought as a lamb to
the slaughter, and as a sheep before
her shearers is dumb so he opened
not his mouth.

8 He was taken from prison and
from judgment; and who shall de-
clare his generation? For he was
cut off out of the land of the living;
for the transgressions of my people
was he stricken.

9 And he made his grave with the
wicked, and with the rich in his
death; because he had done no evil,
neither was any deceit in his mouth.

10 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise
him; he hath put him to grief; when
thou shalt make his soul an offer-
ing for sin he shall see his seed,
he shall prolong his days, and the
pleasure of the Lord shall prosper
in his hand.

11 He shall see the travail of his
soul, and shall be satisfied; by
his knowledge shall my righteous

 

servant justify many; for he shall
bear their iniquities.

12 Therefore will I divide him a
portion with the great, and he shall
divide the spoil with the strong; be-
cause he hath poured out his soul
unto death; and he was numbered
with the transgressors; and he bore
the sins of many, and made inter-
cession for the transgressors.

tion.Little children have eternal life.

AND now Abinadi said unto them:
I would that ye should understand
that God himself shall come down
among the children of men, and
shall redeem his people.

2 And because he dwelleth in
flesh he shall be called the Son of
God, and having subjected the flesh
to the will of the Father, being the
Father and the Son.

3 The Father, because he was
â€™conceived by the power of God;
and the Son, because of the flesh;
thus becoming the Father and
Son.
