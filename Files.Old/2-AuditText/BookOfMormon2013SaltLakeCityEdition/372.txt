AND now it came to pass that when
Moroni had received this epistle
his heart did take courage, and was
filled with exceedingly great joy be-
cause of the faithfulness of Pahoran,
that he was not also a traitor to the
freedom and cause of his country.

2 But he did also mourn exceed-
ingly because of the iniquity of those
who had driven Pahoran from the
judgment-seat, yea, in fine because
of those who had rebelled against
their country and also their God.

3 And it came to pass that Moroni
took a small number of men, ac-
cording to the desire of Pahoran,
and gave Lehi and Teancum com-
mand over the remainder of his
army, and took his march towards
the land of Gideon.

4 And he did raise the standard
of liberty in whatsoever place he
did enter, and gained whatsoever
force he could in all his march to-
wards the land of Gideon.

5 And it came to pass that thou-
sands did flock unto his standard,
and did take up their swords in the
defence of their freedom, that they
might not come into bondage.

6 And thus, when Moroni had
gathered together whatsoever men
he could in all his march, he came
to the land of Gideon; and uniting
his forces with those of Pahoran
they became exceedingly strong,
even stronger than the men of

 

Pachus, who was the king of those
dissenters who had driven the
freemen out of the land of Zara-
hemla and had taken possession
of the land.

7 And it came to pass that Mo-
roni and Pahoran went down with
their armies into the land of Zara-
hemla, and went forth against the
city, and did meet the men of Pa-
chus, insomuch that they did come
to battle.

8 And behold, Pachus was slain
and his men were taken prisoners,
and Pahoran was restored to his
judgment-seat.

9 And the men of Pachus received
their trial, according to the law, and
also those king-men who had been
taken and cast into prison; and
they were executed according to
the law; yea, those men of Pachus
and those king-men, whosoever
would not take up arms in the de-
fence of their country, but would
fight against it, were put to death.

10 And thus it became expedient
that this law should be strictly ob-
served for the safety of their coun-
try; yea, and whosoever was found
denying their freedom was speed-
ily executed according to the law.

11 And thus ended the thirtieth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi; Moroni and
Pahoran having restored peace to
the land of Zarahemla, among their
own people, having inflicted death
upon all those who were not true
to the cause of freedom.

12 And it came to pass in the
commencement of the thirty and
first year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi, Moroni
immediately caused that provisions
should be sent, and also an army
of six thousand men should be sent
unto Helaman, to assist him in pre-
serving that part of the land.

13 And he also caused that an
