CHAPTER 3

The brother of Jared sees the finger of
the Lord as He touches sixteen stones.
Christ shows His spirit body to the
brother of Jared.Those who have a
perfect knowledge cannot be kept from
within the veil.Interpreters are pro-
vided to bring the Jaredite record to light.

AND it came to pass that the brother
of Jared, (now the number of the
vessels which had been prepared
was eight) went forth unto the
mount, which they called the mount
â€™Shelem, because of its exceeding
height, and did molten out of a rock
sixteen small stones; and they were
white and clear, even as transpar-
ent glass; and he did carry them
in his hands upon the top of the
mount, and cried again unto the
Lord, saying:

2 O Lord, thou hast said that we
must be encompassed about by the
floods. Now behold, O Lord, and do
not be Zangry with thy servant be-
cause of his weakness before thee;
for we know that thou art holy and
dwellest in the heavens, and that
we are 'unworthy before thee; be-
cause of the fall our natures have
become evil continually; neverthe-
less, O Lord, thou hast given us a
commandment that we must call
upon thee, that from thee we may
receive according to our desires.

3 Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten.
us because of our iniquity, and hast
driven us forth, and for these many
years we have been in the wilder-
ness; nevertheless, thou hast been
merciful unto us. O Lord, look upon
me in pity, and turn away thine an-
ger from this thy people, and suffer
not that they shall go forth across

 

this raging deep in darkness; but
behold these things which I have
molten out of the rock.

4 And I know, O Lord, that thou
hast all power, and can do what-
soever thou wilt for the benefit of
man; therefore touch these stones, O
Lord, with thy finger, and prepare
them that they may shine forth in
darkness; and they shall shine forth
unto us in the vessels which we
have prepared, that we may have
light while we shall cross the sea.

5 Behold, O Lord, thou canst do
this. We know that thou art able
to show forth great power, which
looks small unto the understand-
ing of men.

6 And it came to pass that when
the brother of Jared had said these
words, behold, the Lord stretched
forth his hand and touched the
stones one by one with his finger.
And the veil was taken from off the
eyes of the brother of Jared, and he
saw the finger of the Lord; and it
was as the finger of a man, like unto
flesh and blood; and the brother of
Jared fell down before the Lord,
for he was struck with fear.

7 And the Lord saw that the
brother of Jared had fallen to the
earth; and the Lord said unto him:
Arise, why hast thou fallen?

8 And he saith unto the Lord: I
saw the finger of the Lord, and
I feared lest he should smite me;
for I knew not that the Lord had
flesh and blood.

9 And the Lord said unto him:
Because of thy faith thou hast seen
that I shall take upon me flesh and
blood; and never has man come be-
fore me with such exceeding faith
as thou hast; for were it not so ye
