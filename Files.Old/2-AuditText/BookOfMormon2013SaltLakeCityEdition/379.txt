was no time for the Nephites to
gather together their armies.

20 Therefore Coriantumr did cut
down the watch by the entrance
of the city, and did march forth
with his whole army into the city,
and they did slay every one who
did oppose them, insomuch that
they did take possession of the
whole city.

21 And it came to pass that Pacu-
meni, who was the chief judge, did
flee before Coriantumr, even to
the walls of the city. And it came
to pass that Coriantumr did smite
him against the wall, insomuch that
he died. And thus ended the days
of Pacumeni.

22 And now when Coriantumr
saw that he was in possession of
the city of Zarahemla, and saw that
the Nephites had fled before them,
and were slain, and were taken, and
were cast into prison, and that he
had obtained the possession of the
strongest hold in all the land, his
heart took courage insomuch that
he was about to go forth against all
the land.

23 And now he did not tarry in
the land of Zarahemla, but he did
march forth with a large army, even
towards the city of Bountiful; for
it was his determination to go forth
and cut his way through with the
sword, that he might obtain the
north parts of the land.

24 And, supposing that their great-
est strength was in the center of the
land, therefore he did march forth,
giving them no time to assemble
themselves together save it were in
small bodies; and in this manner
they did fall upon them and cut
them down to the earth.

25 But behold, this march of Co-
riantumr through the center of the
land gave Moronihah great advan-
tage over them, notwithstanding
the greatness of the number of the
Nephites who were slain.

26 For behold, Moronihah had

 

supposed that the Lamanites durst
not come into the center of the
land, but that they would attack the
cities round about in the borders
as they had hitherto done; there-
fore Moronihah had caused that
their strong armies should main-
tain those parts round about by the
borders.

27 But behold, the Lamanites were
not frightened according to his de-
sire, but they had come into the
center of the land, and had taken
the capital city which was the city
of Zarahemla, and were marching
through the most capital parts of
the land, slaying the people witha
great slaughter, both men, women,
and children, taking possession of
many cities and of many strongholds.

28 But when Moronihah had dis-
covered this, he immediately sent
forth Lehi with an army round about
to head them before they should
come to the land Bountiful.

29 And thus he did; and he did
head them before they came to the
land Bountiful, and gave unto them
battle, insomuch that they began
to retreat back towards the land
of Zarahemla.

30 And it came to pass that Moroni-
hah did head them in their retreat,
and did give unto them battle, in-
somuch that it became an exceed-
ingly bloody battle; yea, many were
slain, and among the number who
were slain Coriantumr was also
found.

31 And now, behold, the Lamanites
could not retreat either way, neither
on the north, nor on the south, nor on
the east, nor on the west, for they
were surrounded on every hand by
the Nephites.

32 And thus had Coriantumr
plunged the Lamanites into the
midst of the Nephites, insomuch
that they were in the power of the
Nephites, and he himself was slain,
and the Lamanites did yield them-
selves into the hands of the Nephites.
