mothers and our fair daughters, and
our children have been spared, and
not have been buried up in that
great city Moronihah. And thus
were the howlings of the people
great and terrible.

CHAPTER 9

In the darkness, the voice of Christ pro-
claims the destruction of many people
and cities for their wickedness.He
also proclaims His divinity, announces
that the law of Moses is fulfilled, and
invites men to come unto Him and be
saved. About A.D. 34.

AND it came to pass that there was a
voice heard among all the inhabi-
tants of the earth, upon all the face
of this land, crying:

2 Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo
unto the inhabitants of the whole
earth except they shall repent; for
the devil laugheth, and his angels
rejoice, because of the slain of the
fair sons and daughters of my peo-
ple; and it is because of their iniq-
uity and abominations that they
are fallen!

3 Behold, that great city Zarahemla
have I burned with fire, and the
inhabitants thereof.

4 And behold, that great city Mo-
roni have I caused to be sunk in the
depths of the sea, and the inhabi-
tants thereof to be drowned.

5 And behold, that great city Mo-
ronihah have I covered with earth,
and the inhabitants thereof, to hide
their iniquities and their abomina-
tions from before my face, that the
blood of the prophets and the saints
shall not come any more unto me
against them.

 

6 And behold, the city of Gilgal
have I caused to be sunk, and the
inhabitants thereof to be buried up
in the depths of the earth;

7 Yea, and the city of Onihah and
the inhabitants thereof, and the
city of Mocum and the inhabitants
thereof, and the city of Jerusalem
and the inhabitants thereof; and
waters have I caused to come up
in the stead thereof, to hide their
wickedness and abominations from
before my face, that the blood of
the prophets and the saints shall
not come up any more unto me
against them.

8 And behold, the city of Gadiandi,
and the city of Gadiomnah, and
the city of Jacob, and the city of
Gimgimno, all these have I caused
to be sunk, and made hills and val-
leys in the places thereof; and the
inhabitants thereof have I buried
up in the depths of the earth, to
hide their wickedness and abomi-
nations from before my face, that
the blood of the prophets and the
saints should not come up any more
unto me against them.

9 And behold, that great city
Jacobugath, which was inhabited
by the people of king Jacob, have I
caused to be burned with fire be-
cause of their sins and their wick-
edness, which was above all the
wickedness of the whole earth, be-
cause of their secret murders and
combinations; for it was they that did
destroy the peace of my people and
the government of the land; there-
fore I did cause them to be burned,
to destroy them from before my
face, that the blood of the prophets
and the saints should not come up
unto me any more against them.
