him for assistance; for behold they
were not in the wrong.

28 And it came to pass that when
the people of Morianton, who were
led by aman whose name was Mori-
anton, found that the people of Lehi
had fled to the camp of Moroni,
they were exceedingly fearful lest
the army of Moroni should come
upon them and destroy them.

29 Therefore, Morianton put it into
their hearts that they should flee
to the land which was northward,
which was covered with large bod-
ies of water, and take possession of
the land which was northward.

30 And behold, they would have
carried this plan into effect, (which
would have been a cause to have
been lamented) but behold, Mori-
anton being a man of much passion,
therefore he was angry with one of
his maid servants, and he fell upon
her and beat her much.

31 And it came to pass that she
fled, and came over to the camp of
Moroni, and told Moroni all things
concerning the matter, and also
concerning their intentions to flee
into the land northward.

32 Now behold, the people who
were in the land Bountiful, or rather
Moroni, feared that they would
hearken to the words of Morian-
ton and unite with his people, and
thus he would obtain possession
of those parts of the land, which
would lay a foundation for serious
consequences among the people of
Nephi, yea, which consequences
would lead to the overthrow of their
liberty.

33 Therefore Moroni sent an army,
with their camp, to head the people
of Morianton, to stop their flight
into the land northward.

34 And it came to pass that they
did not head them until they had

 

come to the borders of the land
â€™Desolation; and there they did
head them, by the narrow pass
which led by the sea into the land
northward, yea, by the sea, on the
west and on the east.

35 And it came to pass that the
army which was sent by Moroni,
which was led by a man whose
name was Teancum, did meet the
people of Morianton; and so stub-
born were the people of Morianton,
(being inspired by his wickedness
and his flattering words) that a
battle commenced between them,
in the which Teancum did slay
Morianton and defeat his army, and
took them prisoners, and returned
to the camp of Moroni. And thus
ended the twenty and fourth year
of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

36 And thus were the people of
Morianton brought back. And upon.
their covenanting to keep the peace
they were restored to the land of
Morianton, and a union took place
between them and the people of
Lehi; and they were also restored
to their lands.

37 And it came to pass that in the
same year that the people of Nephi
had peace restored unto them, that
Nephihah, the second chief judge,
died, having filled the judgment-
seat with perfect uprightness be-
fore God.

38 Nevertheless, he had refused
Alma to take possession of those
records and those things which
were esteemed by Alma and his
fathers to be most sacred; therefore
Alma had conferred them upon his
son, Helaman.

39 Behold, it came to pass that the
son of Nephihah was appointed to
fill the judgment-seat, in the stead
of his father; yea, he was appointed
