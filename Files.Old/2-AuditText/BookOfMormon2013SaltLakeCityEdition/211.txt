33 But notwithstanding all this,
they did impart much consolation
to the church, confirming their
faith, and exhorting them with long-
suffering and much travail to keep
the commandments of God.

34 And four of them were the sons
of Mosiah; and their names were
Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner,
and Himni; these were the names
of the sons of Mosiah.

35 And they traveled through-
out all the land of Zarahemla, and
among all the people who were
under the reign of king Mosiah,
zealously striving to repair all the
injuries which they had done to the
church, confessing all their sins,
and publishing all the things which
they had seen, and explaining the
prophecies and the scriptures to all
who desired to hear them.

36 And thus they were instru-
ments in the hands of God in bring-
ing many to the knowledge of the
truth, yea, to the knowledge of their
Redeemer.

37 And how blessed are they! For
they did publish peace; they did
publish good tidings of good; and
they did declare unto the people
that the Lord reigneth.

CHAPTER 28

The sons of Mosiah go to preach to the
Lamanites.Using the two seer stones,
Mosiah translates the Jaredite plates.
About 92 B.c.

Now it came to pass that after the
sons of Mosiah had done all these
things, they took a small number
with them and returned to their
father, the king, and desired of
him that he would grant unto them

 

that they might, with these whom
they had selected, go up to the land
of Nephi that they might preach
the things which they had heard,
and that they might impart the
word of God to their brethren, the
Lamanites.

2 That perhaps they might bring
them to the knowledge of the Lord
their God, and convince them of the
iniquity of their fathers; and that
perhaps they might cure them of
their hatred towards the Nephites,
that they might also be brought to
rejoice in the Lord their God, that
they might become friendly to
one another, and that there should
be no more contentions in all the
land which the Lord their God had
given them.

3 Now they were desirous that sal-
vation should be declared to every
creature, for they could not bear
that any human soul should per-
ish; yea, even the very thoughts that
any soul should endure endless
torment did cause them to quake
and tremble.

4 And thus did the Spirit of the
Lord work upon them, for they were
the very vilest of sinners. And the
Lord saw fit in his infinite mercy
to spare them; nevertheless they
suffered much anguish of soul be-
cause of their iniquities, suffering
much and fearing that they should
be cast off forever.

5 And it came to pass that they
did plead with their father many
days that they might go up to the
land of Nephi.

6 And king Mosiah went and in-
quired of the Lord if he should let
his sons go up among the Laman-
ites to preach the word.
