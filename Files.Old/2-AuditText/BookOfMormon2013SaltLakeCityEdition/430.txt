people that they should take their
flight into the northernmost part of
the land, and there build up unto
themselves a kingdom, until they
were joined by dissenters, (for he
flattered them that there would be
many dissenters) and they become
sufficiently strong to contend with
the tribes of the people; and they
did so.

13 And so speedy was their march
that it could not be impeded until
they had gone forth out of the reach
of the people. And thus ended the
thirtieth year; and thus were the
affairs of the people of Nephi.

14 And it came to pass in the
thirty and first year that they were
divided into tribes, every man
according to his family, kindred
and friends; nevertheless they had
come to an agreement that they
would not go to war one with an-
other; but they were not united as
to their laws, and their manner of
government, for they were estab-
lished according to the minds of
those who were their chiefs and
their leaders. But they did estab-
lish very strict laws that one tribe
should not trespass against another,
insomuch that in some degree they
had peace in the land; nevertheless,
their hearts were turned from the
Lord their God, and they did stone
the prophets and did cast them
out from among them.

15 And it came to pass that
Nephi.having been visited by an-
gels and also the voice of the Lord,
therefore having seen angels, and
being eye-witness, and having had
power given unto him that he might
know concerning the ministry of
Christ, and also being eye-witness
to their quick return from righ-
teousness unto their wickedness and
abominations;

 

16 Therefore, being grieved for
the hardness of their hearts and
the blindness of their minds.went
forth among them in that same
year, and began to testify, boldly,
repentance and remission of sins
through faith on the Lord Jesus
Christ.

17 And he did minister many
things unto them; and all of them
cannot be written, and a part of
them would not suffice, therefore
they are not written in this book.
And Nephi did minister with power
and with great authority.

18 And it came to pass that they
were angry with him, even because
he had greater power than they,
for it were not possible that they
could disbelieve his words, for so
great was his faith on the Lord Jesus
Christ that angels did minister unto
him daily.

19 And in the name of Jesus did he
cast out devils and unclean spirits;
and even his brother did he raise
from the dead, after he had been
stoned and suffered death by the
people.

20 And the people saw it, and did
witness of it, and were angry with
him because of his power; and he
did also do many more miracles,
in the sight of the people, in the
name of Jesus.

21 And it came to pass that the
thirty and first year did pass away,
and there were but few who were
converted unto the Lord; but as
many as were converted did truly
signify unto the people that they
had been visited by the power and
Spirit of God, which was in Jesus
Christ, in whom they believed.

22 And as many as had devils cast
out from them, and were healed
of their sicknesses and their infir-
mities, did truly manifest unto the
