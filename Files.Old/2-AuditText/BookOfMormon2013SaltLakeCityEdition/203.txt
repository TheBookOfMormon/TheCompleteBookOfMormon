your heads and be of good comfort,
for I know of the covenant which
ye have made unto me; and I will
covenant with my people and de-
liver them out of bondage.

14 And I will also ease the bur-
dens which are put upon your
shoulders, that even you cannot feel
them upon your backs, even while
you are in bondage; and this will 1
do that ye may stand as witnesses
for me hereafter, and that ye may
know of a surety that I, the Lord
God, do visit my people in their
afflictions.

15 And now it came to pass that
the burdens which were laid upon
Alma and his brethren were made
light; yea, the Lord did strengthen
them that they could bear up their
burdens with ease, and they did
submit cheerfully and with pa-
tience to all the will of the Lord.

16 And it came to pass that so
great was their faith and their pa-
tience that the voice of the Lord
came unto them again, saying: Be
of good comfort, for on the morrow
I will deliver you out of bondage.

17 And he said unto Alma: Thou
shalt go before this people, and I
will go with thee and deliver this
people out of bondage.

18 Now it came to pass that Alma
and his people in the night-time
gathered their flocks together, and
also of their grain; yea, even all the
night-time were they gathering their
flocks together.

19 And in the morning the Lord
caused a deep sleep to come upon
the Lamanites, yea, and all their
task-masters were in a profound
sleep.

20 And Alma and his people de-
parted into the wilderness; and
when they had traveled all day
they pitched their tents in a valley,

 

and they called the valley Alma,
because he led their way in the
wilderness.

21 Yea, and in the valley of Alma
they poured out their thanks to
God because he had been merciful
unto them, and eased their bur-
dens, and had delivered them out
of bondage; for they were in bond-
age, and none could deliver them
except it were the Lord their God.

22 And they gave thanks to God,
yea, all their men and all their
women and all their children that
could speak lifted their voices in
the praises of their God.

23 And now the Lord said unto
Alma: Haste thee and get thou and
this people out of this land, for the
Lamanites have awakened and do
pursue thee; therefore get thee out
of this land, and I will stop the
Lamanites in this valley that they
come no further in pursuit of this
people.

24 And it came to pass that they
departed out of the valley, and took
their journey into the wilderness.

25 And after they had been in
the wilderness twelve days they
arrived in the land of Zarahemla;
and king Mosiah did also receive
them with joy.

CHAPTER 25

The descendants of Mulek at Zarahemla
become Nephites.They learn of the
people of Alma and of Zeniff.Alma
baptizes Limhi and all his people.
Mosiah authorizes Alma to organize the
Church of God. About 120 B.c.

AND now king Mosiah caused that
all the people should be gathered
together.

2 Now there were not so many of
the children of Nephi, or so many
of those who were descendants of
