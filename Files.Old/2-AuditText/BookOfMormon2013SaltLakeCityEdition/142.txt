the light of the day, harden not
your hearts.

6 Yea, today, if ye will hear his
voice, harden not your hearts; for
why will ye die?

7 For behold, after ye have been
nourished by the good word of God
all the day long, will ye bring forth
evil fruit, that ye must be hewn
down and cast into the fire?

8 Behold, will ye reject these
words? Will ye reject the words of
the prophets; and will ye reject all
the words which have been spoken
concerning Christ, after so many
have spoken concerning him; and
â€™deny the good word of Christ, and
the power of God, and the gift of
the Holy Ghost, and quench the
Holy Spirit, and make a mock of
the great plan of redemption, which
hath been laid for you?

9 Know ye not that if ye will do
these things, that the power of the
redemption and the resurrection,
which is in Christ, will bring you
to stand with shame and awful
guilt before the bar of God?

10 And according to the power of
justice, for justice cannot be denied,
ye must go away into that lake of
fire and brimstone, whose flames
are unquenchable, and whose smoke
ascendeth up forever and ever,
which lake of fire and brimstone
is endless torment.

11 O then, my beloved brethren,
repent ye, and enter in at the strait
gate, and continue in the way
which is narrow, until ye shall ob-
tain eternal life.

12 O be wise; what can I say more?

13 Finally, I bid you farewell, until

 

I shall meet you before the pleas-
ing bar of God, which bar striketh
the wicked with awful dread and
fear. Amen.

CHAPTER 7

Sherem denies Christ, contends with
Jacob, demands a sign, and is smitten
of God.All of the prophets have spo-
ken of Christ and His Atonement.The
Nephites lived out their days as wan-
derers, born in tribulation, and hated
by the Lamanites. About 544-421 B.C.

AND now it came to pass after some
years had passed away, there came
aman among the people of Nephi,
whose name was Sherem.

2 And it came to pass that he
began to preach among the peo-
ple, and to declare unto them that
there should be no Christ. And he
preached many things which were
flattering unto the people; and this
he did that he might toverthrow the
doctrine of Christ.

3 And he labored diligently that he
might lead away the hearts of the
people, insomuch that he did lead
away many hearts; and he knowing
that I, Jacob, had faith in Christ who
should come, he sought much oppor-
tunity that he might come unto me.

4 And he was learned, that he
had a perfect knowledge of the lan-
guage of the people; wherefore, he
could use much flattery, and much
power of speech, according to the
power of the devil.

5 And he had hope to shake me
from the faith, notwithstanding the
many revelations and the many
things which I had seen concerning
