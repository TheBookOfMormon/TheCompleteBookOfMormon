@death in the most aggravating and
distressing manner which could be
inflicted by their brethren, before
they would take the sword or cime-
ter to smite them.

30 And thus they were a zealous
and beloved people, a highly fa-
vored people of the Lord.

CHAPTER 28

The Lamanites are defeated in a tre-
mendous battle.Tens of thousands
are slain.The wicked are consigned
to a state of endless woe; the righteous
attain a never-ending happiness. About
77-76 B.C.

AND now it came to pass that after
the people of Ammon were estab-
lished in the land of Jershon, and
a church also established in the
land of Jershon, and the armies of
the Nephites were set round about
the land of Jershon, yea, in all the
borders round about the land of
Zarahemla; behold the armies of
the Lamanites had followed their
brethren into the wilderness.

2 And thus there was a tremen-
dous battle; yea, even such an one
as never had been known among
all the people in the land from the
time Lehi left Jerusalem; yea, and
tens of thousands of the Lamanites
were slain and scattered abroad.

3 Yea, and also there was a tremen-
dous slaughter among the people of
Nephi; nevertheless, the Lamanites
were driven and scattered, and the
people of Nephi returned again to
their land.

4 And now this was a time that
there was a great mourning and
lamentation heard throughout all
the land, among all the people of
Nephi.

5 Yea, the cry of widows mourn-
ing for their husbands, and also of
fathers mourning for their sons,

 

and the daughter for the brother,
yea, the brother for the father;
and thus the cry of mourning was
heard among all of them, mourn-
ing for their kindred who had
been slain.

6 And now surely this was a sor-
rowful day; yea, a time of solem-
nity, and a time of much @fasting
and prayer.

7 And thus endeth the fifteenth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi;

8 And this is the account of Am-
mon and his brethren, their jour-
neyings in the land of Nephi, their
sufferings in the land, their sorrows,
and their afflictions, and their in-
comprehensible joy, and the recep-
tion and safety of the brethren in
the land of Jershon. And now may
the Lord, the Redeemer of all men,
bless their souls forever.

9 And this is the account of the
wars and contentions among the
Nephites, and also the wars between.
the Nephites and the Lamanites;
and the fifteenth year of the reign
of the judges is ended.

10 And from the first year to the
fifteenth has brought to pass the
destruction of many thousand lives;
yea, it has brought to pass an awful
scene of bloodshed.

11 And the bodies of many thou-
sands are laid low in the earth,
while the bodies of many thousands
are moldering in heaps upon the
face of the earth; yea, and many
thousands are mourning for the
loss of their kindred, because they
have reason to fear, according to the
promises of the Lord, that they are
consigned to a state of endless wo.

12 While many thousands of others
truly mourn for the loss of their
kindred, yet they rejoice and exult
in the hope, and even know, accord-
ing to the promises of the Lord, that
