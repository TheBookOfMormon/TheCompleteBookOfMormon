29 And he answered, No.

30 Now Zeezrom said unto him
again: How knowest thou these
things?

31 And he said: An angel hath
made them known unto me.

32 And Zeezrom said again: Who
is he that shall come? Is it the Son
of God?

33 And he said unto him, Yea.

34 And Zeezrom said again: Shall
he save his people in their sins?
And Amulek answered and said
unto him: I say unto you he shall
not, for it is impossible for him to
deny his word.

35 Now Zeezrom said unto the
people: See that ye remember these
things; for he said there is but one
God; yet he saith that the Son of.
God shall come, but he shall not
save his people.as though he had
authority to command God.

36 Now Amulek saith again unto
him: Behold thou hast lied, for
thou sayest that I spake as though
I had authority to command God
because I said he shall not save his
people in their sins.

37 And I say unto you again that
he cannot save them in their sins;
for I cannot deny his word, and he
hath said that no unclean thing
can inherit the kingdom of heaven;
therefore, how can ye be saved,
except ye inherit the kingdom of
heaven? Therefore, ye cannot be
saved in your sins.

38 Now Zeezrom saith again unto
him: Is the Son of God the very
Eternal Father?

39 And Amulek said unto him:
Yea, he is the very Eternal Father

 

of heaven and of earth, and all

and the last;

world to redeem his people; and
he shall take upon him the trans-

his name; and these are they that
shall have eternal life, and salva-
tion cometh to none else.

41 Therefore the wicked remain as
though there had been no redemp-
tion made, except it be the loosing
of the bands of death; for behold,
the day cometh that all shall rise
from the dead and stand before
God, and be judged according to
their works.

42 Now, there is a death which
is called a temporal death; and
the death of Christ shall loose the
bands of this temporal death, that
all shall be raised from this temporal
death.

43 The spirit and the body shall
be reunited again in its perfect
form; both limb and joint shall be
restored to its proper frame, even
as we now are at this time; and we
shall be brought to stand before
God, knowing even as we know
now, and have a bright recollec-
tion of all our guilt.

44 Now, this restoration shall
come to all, both old and young,
both bond and free, both male and
female, both the wicked and the
righteous; and even there shall not
so much as a hair of their heads be
lost; but every thing shall be re-
stored to its perfect frame, as it is
now, or in the body, and shall be
