me.that I should give unto this
people this land for their inheri-
tance.

17 And then the words of the
prophet Isaiah shall be fulfilled,
which say:

18 ?Thy watchmen shall lift up
the voice; with the voice together
shall they sing, for they shall see
eye to eye when the Lord shall bring
again Zion.

19 Break forth into joy, sing to-
gether, ye waste places of Jerusalem;
for the Lord hath comforted his peo-
ple, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.

20 The Lord hath made bare his
holy arm in the eyes of all the na-
tions; and all the ends of the earth
shall see the salvation of God.

CHAPTER 17

Jesus directs the people to ponder His
words and pray for understanding.
He heals their sick.He prays for the
people, using language that cannot be
written.Angels minister to and fire
encircles their little ones. About A.D. 34.

BEHOLD, now it came to pass that
when Jesus had spoken these words
he looked round about again on the
multitude, and he said unto them:
Behold, my time is at hand.

21 perceive that ye are weak,
that ye cannot understand all my
words which I am commanded of
the Father to speak unto you at
this time.

3 Therefore, go ye unto your homes,
and ponder upon the things which
Ihave said, and ask of the Father, in
my name, that ye may understand,

 

and prepare your minds for the
morrow, and I come unto you again.

4 But now I go unto the Father,
and also to show myself unto the
lost tribes of Israel, for they are not
lost unto the Father, for he knoweth
whither he hath taken them.

5 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his
eyes round about again on the
multitude, and beheld they were
in tears, and did look steadfastly
upon him as if they would ask
him to tarry a little longer with
them.

6 And he said unto them: Behold,
my bowels are filled with compas-
sion towards you.

7 Have ye any that are sick among
you? Bring them hither. Have ye
any that are lame, or blind, or halt,
or maimed, or leprous, or that are
withered, or that are deaf, or that
are afflicted in any manner? Bring
them hither and I will heal them,
for I have compassion upon you;
my bowels are filled with mercy.

8 For I perceive that ye desire that
Ishould show unto you what I have
done unto your brethren at Jeru-
salem, for I see that your faith is
â€™sufficient that I should heal you.

9 And it came to pass that when he
had thus spoken, all the multitude,
with one accord, did go forth with
their sick and their afflicted, and
their lame, and with their blind,
and with their dumb, and with all
them that were afflicted in any
manner; and he did heal them ev-
ery one as they were brought forth
unto him.
