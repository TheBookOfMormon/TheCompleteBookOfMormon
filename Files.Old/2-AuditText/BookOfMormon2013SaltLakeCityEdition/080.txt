ye not the reproach of men, nei-
ther be ye afraid of their revilings.

8 For the moth shall eat them
up like a garment, and the worm
shall eat them like wool. But my
righteousness shall be forever, and
my salvation from generation to
generation.

9 Awake, awake! Put on strength,
O arm of the Lord; awake as in the
ancient days. Art thou not he that
hath cut Rahab, and wounded the
4dragon?

10 Art thou not he who hath dried
the sea, the waters of the great deep;
that hath made the depths of the
sea a way for the ransomed to pass
over?

11 Therefore, the redeemed of the
Lord shall return, and come with
singing unto Zion; and everlasting
joy and holiness shall be upon their
heads; and they shall obtain glad-
ness and joy; sorrow and mourning
shall flee away.

12 Lam he; yea, lam he that com-
forteth you. Behold, who art thou,
that thou shouldst be afraid of
man, who shall die, and of the son
of man, who shall be made like unto
grass?

13 And forgettest the Lord thy
maker, that hath stretched forth
the heavens, and laid the founda-
tions of the earth, and hast feared
continually every day, because of
the fury of the oppressor, as if he
were ready to destroy? And where
is the fury of the oppressor?

14 The captive exile hasteneth,
that he may be loosed, and that he

 

should not die in the pit, nor that
his bread should fail.

15 But I am the Lord thy God,
whose waves roared; the Lord of
Hosts is my name.

16 And I have put my words in
thy mouth, and have covered thee
in the shadow of mine hand, that
I may plant the heavens and lay
the foundations of the earth, and
say unto Zion: Behold, thou art my
â€™people.

17 Awake, awake, stand up, O Je-
rusalem, which hast drunk at the
hand of the Lord the cup of his
fury.thou hast drunken the dregs
of the cup of trembling wrung out.

18 And none to guide her among
all the sons she hath brought forth;
neither that taketh her by the hand,
of all the sons she hath brought up.

19 These two sons are come unto
thee, who shall be sorry for thee.
thy desolation and destruction, and
the famine and the sword.and by
whom shall I comfort thee?

20 Thy sons have fainted, save
these two; they lie at the head of
all the streets; as a wild bull in a
net, they are full of the fury of the
Lord, the rebuke of thy God.

21 Therefore hear now this, thou
afflicted, and drunken, and not
with wine:

22 Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord
and thy God pleadeth the cause of
his people; behold, I have taken out
of thine hand the cup of trembling,
the dregs of the cup of my fury;
thou shalt no more drink it again.

23 But I will put it into the hand
