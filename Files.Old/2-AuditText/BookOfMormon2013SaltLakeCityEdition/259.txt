CHAPTER 17

The sons of Mosiah have the spirit of
prophecy and of revelation.They go
their several ways to declare the word
to the Lamanites.Ammon goes to the
land of Ishmael and becomes the ser-
vant of King Lamoni.Ammon saves
the kingâ€™s flocks and slays his enemies
at the water of Sebus. Verses 1-3, about
77 B.C.; verse 4, about 91-77 B.c.; and
verses 5-39, about 91 B.C.

AND now it came to pass that as
Alma was journeying from the land
of Gideon southward, away to the
land of Manti, behold, to his as-
tonishment, he met with the sons
of Mosiah journeying towards the
land of Zarahemla.

2 Now these sons of Mosiah were
with Alma at the time the angel
first appeared unto him; therefore
Alma did rejoice exceedingly to
see his brethren; and what added
more to his joy, they were still his

the judges; having refused the king-

this was the minds of the people;

7 Nevertheless they departed out
of the land of Zarahemla, and took
their swords, and their spears,
and their bows, and their arrows,
and their slings; and this they did
that they might provide food for
themselves while in the wilderness.

8 And thus they departed into
the wilderness with their numbers
which they had selected, to go up
to the land of Nephi, to preach the
word of God unto the Lamanites.
