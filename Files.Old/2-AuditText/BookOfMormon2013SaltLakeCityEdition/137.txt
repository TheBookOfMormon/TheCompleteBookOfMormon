nourished it this long time, and
only a part of the tree hath brought
forth tame fruit, and the other part
of the tree hath brought forth wild
fruit; behold, I have nourished this
tree like unto the others.

26 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard said unto the
servant: Pluck off the branches that
have not brought forth good fruit,
and cast them into the fire.

27 But behold, the servant said
unto him: Let us prune it, and dig
about it, and nourish it a little lon-
ger, that perhaps it may bring forth
good fruit unto thee, that thou canst
lay it up against the season.

28 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard and the ser-
vant of the Lord of the vineyard did
nourish all the fruit of the vineyard.

29 And it came to pass that a long
time had passed away, and the Lord
of the vineyard said unto his ser-
vant: Come, let us go down into the
vineyard, that we may labor again
in the vineyard. For behold, the
time draweth near, and the end
soon cometh; wherefore, I must lay
up fruit against the season, unto
mine own self.

30 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard and the ser-
vant went down into the vineyard;
and they came to the tree whose
natural branches had been broken
off, and the wild branches had been
grafted in; and behold all sorts of
fruit did cumber the tree.

31 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard did taste of
the fruit, every sort according to its
number. And the Lord of the vine-
yard said: Behold, this long time
have we nourished this tree, and
I have laid up unto myself against
the season much fruit.

32 But behold, this time it hath
brought forth much fruit, and there

 

 

is none of it which is good. And
behold, there are all kinds of bad
fruit; and it profiteth me nothing,
notwithstanding all our labor; and
now it grieveth me that I should
lose this tree.

33 And the Lord of the vineyard
said unto the servant: What shall
we do unto the tree, that I may pre-
serve again good fruit thereof unto
mine own self?

34 And the servant said unto his
master: Behold, because thou didst
graft in the branches of the wild
olive tree they have nourished the
roots, that they are alive and they
have not perished; wherefore thou
beholdest that they are yet good.

35 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard said unto his
servant: The tree profiteth me noth-
ing, and the roots thereof profit me
nothing so long as it shall bring
forth evil fruit.

36 Nevertheless, I know that the
roots are good, and for mine own
purpose I have preserved them; and
because of their much strength they
have hitherto brought forth, from
the wild branches, good fruit.

37 But behold, the wild branches
have grown and have overrun the
roots thereof; and because that
the wild branches have overcome the
roots thereof it hath brought forth
much evil fruit; and because that
it hath brought forth so much evil
fruit thou beholdest that it begin-
neth to perish; and it will soon be-
come ripened, that it may be cast
into the fire, except we should do
something for it to preserve it.

38 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard said unto his
servant: Let us go down into the
nethermost parts of the vineyard,
and behold if the natural branches
have also brought forth evil fruit.

39 And it came to pass that they
