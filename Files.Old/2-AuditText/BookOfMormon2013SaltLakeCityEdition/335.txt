the king was wroth because of
their disobedience; therefore he
gave Amalickiah the command of
that part of his army which was
obedient unto his commands, and
commanded him that he should go
forth and compel them to arms.

4 Now behold, this was the desire
of Amalickiah; for he being a very
subtle man to do evil therefore he
laid the plan in his heart to de-
throne the king of the Lamanites.

5 And now he had got the com-
mand of those parts of the Laman-
ites who were in favor of the king;
and he sought to gain favor of those
who were not obedient; therefore
he went forward to the place which
was called Onidah, for thither had
all the Lamanites fled; for they
discovered the army coming, and,
supposing that they were coming to
destroy them, therefore they fled to
Onidah, to the place of arms.

6 And they had appointed a man
to bea king and a leader over them,
being fixed in their minds with
a determined resolution that they
would not be subjected to go
against the Nephites.

7 And it came to pass that they
had gathered themselves together
upon the top of the mount which
was called Antipas, in preparation
to battle.

8 Now it was not Amalickiah’s in-
tention to give them battle accord-
ing to the commandments of the
king; but behold, it was his inten-
tion to gain favor with the armies of
the Lamanites, that he might place
himself at their head and dethrone
the king and take possession of the
kingdom.

9 And behold, it came to pass that
he caused his army to pitch their
tents in the valley which was near
the mount Antipas.

10 And it came to pass that when it
was night he sent a secret embassy
into the mount Antipas, desiring

 

that the leader of those who were
upon the mount, whose name was
Lehonti, that he should come down
to the foot of the mount, for he de-
sired to speak with him.

11 And it came to pass that when
Lehonti received the message he
durst not go down to the foot of
the mount. And it came to pass that
Amalickiah sent again the second
time, desiring him to come down.
And it came to pass that Lehonti
would not; and he sent again the
third time.

12 And it came to pass that when
Amalickiah found that he could
not get Lehonti to come down off
from the mount, he went up into
the mount, nearly to Lehonti’s camp;
and he sent again the fourth time
his message unto Lehonti, desiring
that he would come down, and that
he would bring his guards with him.

13 And it came to pass that when
Lehonti had come down with his
guards to Amalickiah, that Amal-
ickiah desired him to come down
with his army in the night-time, and
surround those men in their camps
over whom the king had given him
command, and that he would deliver
them up into Lehonti’s hands, if he
would make him (Amalickiah) a
second leader over the whole army.

14 And it came to pass that Lehonti
came down with his men and sur-
rounded the men of Amalickiah, so
that before they awoke at the dawn
of day they were surrounded by the
armies of Lehonti.

15 And it came to pass that when
they saw that they were surrounded,
they pled with Amalickiah that he
would suffer them to fall in with
their brethren, that they might not
be destroyed. Now this was the very
thing which Amalickiah desired.

16 And it came to pass that he
delivered his men, contrary to
the commands of the king. Now
this was the thing that Amalickiah
