yea, if ye could have men for your
kings who would do even as my
father Benjamin did for this
people.lI say unto you, if this could
always be the case then it would
be expedient that ye should always
have kings to rule over you.

14 And even I myself have labored
with all the power and faculties
which I have possessed, to teach
you the commandments of God,
and to establish peace throughout
the land, that there should be no
wars nor contentions, no stealing,
nor plundering, nor murdering, nor
any manner of iniquity;

15 And whosoever has commit-
ted iniquity, him have I punished
according to the crime which he
has committed, according to the
law which has been given to us by
our fathers.

16 Now I say unto you, that because
all men are not just it is not expe-
dient that ye should have a king
or kings to rule over you.

17 For behold, how much iniquity
doth one wicked king cause to be
committed, yea, and what great
destruction!

18 Yea, remember king Noah, his
wickedness and his abominations,
and also the wickedness and abomi-
nations of his people. Behold what
great destruction did come upon
them; and also because of their
iniquities they were brought into
>’bondage.

19 And were it not for the inter-
position of their all-wise Creator,
and this because of their sincere
repentance, they must unavoidably
remain in bondage until now.

20 But behold, he did deliver them

 

because they did humble them-
selves before him; and because they
’cried mightily unto him he did
deliver them out of bondage; and
thus doth the Lord work with his
power in all cases among the chil-
dren of men, extending the arm of
mercy towards them that put their
trust in him.

21 And behold, now I say unto
you, ye cannot dethrone an iniqui-
tous king save it be through much
contention, and the shedding of
much blood.

22 For behold, he has his friends
in iniquity, and he keepeth his
guards about him; and he teareth up
the laws of those who have reigned
in righteousness before him; and he
trampleth under his feet the com-
mandments of God;

23 And he enacteth laws, and send-
eth them forth among his people,
yea, laws after the manner of his
own wickedness; and whosoever
doth not obey his laws he causeth
to be destroyed; and whosoever doth
rebel against him he will send his
armies against them to war, and if
he can he will destroy them; and
thus an unrighteous king doth per-
vert the ways of all righteousness.

24 And now behold I say unto you,
it is not expedient that such abomi-
nations should come upon you.

25 Therefore, choose you by the
4voice of this people, judges, that
ye may be judged according to the
laws which have been given you
by our fathers, which are correct,
and which were given them by the
hand of the Lord.

26 Now it is not common that
the voice of the people desireth
