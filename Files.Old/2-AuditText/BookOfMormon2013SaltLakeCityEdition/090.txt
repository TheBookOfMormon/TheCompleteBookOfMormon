are not, for there could have been
no creation. But there is a God, and
che is Christ, and he cometh in the
fulness of his own time.

8 And now I write some of the
words of Isaiah, that whoso of my
people shall see these words may
lift up their hearts and rejoice for
all men. Now these are the words,
and ye may liken them unto you
and unto all men.

CHAPTER 12

Isaiah sees the latter-day temple, gath-
ering of Israel, and millennial judgment
and peace.The proud and wicked will
be brought low at the Second Coming.
Compare Isaiah 2. About 559-545 B.C.

THE word that Isaiah, the son of
Amoz, saw concerning Judah and
Jerusalem:

2 And it shall come to pass in the
last days, when the mountain of
the Lordâ€™s house shall be estab-
lished in the top of the mountains,
and shall be exalted above the hills,
and all nations shall flow unto it.

3 And many people shall go and
say, Come ye, and let us go up to
the mountain of the Lord, to the
house of the God of Jacob; and he
will teach us of his ways, and we
will walk in his paths; for out of
Zion shall go forth the law, and the
word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

Jacob, because they be replenished
from the east, and hearken unto
4soothsayers like the Philistines,
and they please themselves in the
children of strangers.

7 Their land also is full of silver
and gold, neither is there any end
of their treasures; their land is also
full of horses, neither is there any
end of their chariots.

8 Their land is also full of idols;
they worship the work of their own
hands, that which their own fingers
have made.

9 And the mean man boweth not
down, and the great man humbleth
himself not, therefore, forgive him
not.

10 Oye wicked ones, enter into the
rock, and hide thee in the dust, for
the fear of the Lord and the glory
of his majesty shall smite thee.

11 And it shall come to pass that
the lofty looks of man shall be hum-
bled, and the haughtiness of men
shall be bowed down, and the Lord
alone shall be exalted in that day.

12 For the day of the Lord of
