yea, even after the order of his Son;
and this that it should be shown
unto the people, a great many
thousand years before his coming,
that even redemption should come
unto them.

19 And now I would that ye should
know, that even since the days of
Abraham there have been many
prophets that have testified these
things; yea, behold, the prophet
Zenos did testify boldly; for the
which he was slain.

20 And behold, also Zenock, and
also Ezias, and also Isaiah, and
4Jeremiah, (Jeremiah being that
same prophet who testified of the
destruction of Jerusalem) and
now we know that Jerusalem was
destroyed according to the words
of Jeremiah. O then why not the
Son of God come, according to his
prophecy?

21 And now will you dispute that
Jerusalem was destroyed? Will ye
say that the sons of Zedekiah were
not slain, all except it were Mulek?
Yea, and do ye not behold that the
seed of Zedekiah are with us, and
they were driven out of the land
of Jerusalem? But behold, this is
not all.

22 Our father Lehi was driven
out of Jerusalem because he tes-
tified of these things. Nephi also
testified of these things, and also
almost all of our fathers, even down
to this time; yea, they have testified
of the coming of Christ, and have
looked forward, and have rejoiced
in his day which is to come.

23 And behold, he is God, and he

 

is with them, and he did manifest
himself unto them, that they were
redeemed by him; and they gave
unto him glory, because of that
which is to come.

24 And now, seeing ye know these
things and cannot deny them ex-
cept ye shall lie, therefore in this
ye have sinned, for ye have rejected
all these things, notwithstanding
so many evidences which ye have
received; yea, even ye have received
all things, both things in heaven,
and all things which are in the
earth, as a witness that they are
true.

25 But behold, ye have rejected the
truth, and rebelled against your
holy God; and even at this time,
instead of laying up for yourselves
treasures in heaven, where nothing
doth corrupt, and where nothing can
come which is unclean, ye are heap-
ing up for yourselves wrath against
the day of judgment.

26 Yea, even at this time ye are
ripening, because of your murders
and your fornication and wicked-
ness, for everlasting destruction;
yea, and except ye repent it will
come unto you soon.

27 Yea, behold it is now even at
your doors; yea, go ye in unto the
judgment-seat, and search; and be-
hold, your judge is murdered, and
he lieth in his blood; and he hath
been murdered by his brother, who
seeketh to sit in the judgment-seat.

28 And behold, they both belong
to your secret band, whose author
is Gadianton and the evil one who
seeketh to destroy the souls of men.
