If ye teach the law of Moses why
do ye not keep it? Why do ye set
your hearts upon riches? Why do
ye commit whoredoms and spend
your strength with harlots, yea,
and cause this people to commit
sin, that the Lord has cause to send
me to prophesy against this people,
yea, even a great evil against this
people?

30 Know ye not that I speak the
truth? Yea, ye know that I speak
the truth; and you ought to tremble
before God.

31 And it shall come to pass that
ye shall be smitten for your iniqui-
ties, for ye have said that ye teach
the law of Moses. And what know
ye concerning the law of Moses?
Doth salvation come by the law
of Moses? What say ye?

32 And they answered and said
that salvation did come by the law
of Moses.

33 But now Abinadi said unto
them: I know if ye keep the com-
mandments of God ye shall be
saved; yea, if ye keep the command-
ments which the Lord delivered
unto Moses in the mount of Sinai,
saying:

34 I am the Lord thy God, who
hath brought thee out of the land of
Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

35 Thou shalt have no other God
before me.

36 Thou shalt not make unto thee
any graven image, or any likeness of
any thing in heaven above, or things
which are in the earth beneath.

37 Now Abinadi said unto them,
Have ye done all this? I say unto
you, Nay, ye have not. And have ye
taught this people that they should
do all these things? I say unto you,
Nay, ye have not.

 

CHAPTER 13

Abinadi is protected by divine power.
He teaches the Ten Commandments.
Salvation does not come by the law of
Moses alone.God Himself will make
an atonement and redeem His people.
About 148 B.c.

AND now when the king had heard
these words, he said unto his priests:
Away with this fellow, and slay him;
for what have we to do with him, for
he is mad.

2 And they stood forth and at-
tempted to lay their hands on him;
but he withstood them, and said
unto them:

3 Touch me not, for God shall
smite you if ye lay your hands
upon me, for I have not delivered
the message which the Lord sent
me to deliver; neither have I told
you that which ye requested that I
should tell; therefore, God will not
suffer that I shall be destroyed at
this time.

4 But I must fulfil the command-
ments wherewith God has com-
manded me; and because I have told
you the truth ye are angry with me.
And again, because I have spoken
the word of God ye have judged me
that I am mad.

5 Now it came to pass after Abin-
adi had spoken these words that the
people of king Noah durst not lay
their hands on him, for the Spirit
of the Lord was upon him; and his
face shone with exceeding luster,
even as Mosesâ€™ did while in the
mount of Sinai, while speaking with
the Lord.

6 And he spake with power and
authority from God; and he contin-
ued his words, saying:
