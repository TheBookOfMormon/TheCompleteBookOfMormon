cities, and did administer that which
was good unto his people in all his
days. And it came to pass that he
had no children even until he was
exceedingly old.

24 And it came to pass that his
wife died, being an hundred and
two years old. And it came to pass
that Coriantum took to wife, in his
old age, a young maid, and begat
sons and daughters; wherefore he
lived until he was an hundred and
forty and two years old.

25 And it came to pass that he be-
gat Com, and Com reigned in his
stead; and he reigned forty and nine
years, and he begat Heth; and he
also begat other sons and daughters.

26 And the people had spread
again over all the face of the land,
and there began again to be an ex-
ceedingly great wickedness upon
the face of the land, and Heth
began to embrace the secret plans
again of old, to destroy his father.

27 And it came to pass that he did
dethrone his father, for he slew him
with his own sword; and he did
reign in his stead.

28 And there came prophets in
the land again, crying repentance
unto them.that they must pre-
pare the way of the Lord or there
should come a curse upon the face
of the land; yea, even there should
be a great famine, in which they
should be destroyed if they did not
repent.

29 But the people believed not the
words of the prophets, but they cast
them out; and some of them they
cast into pits and left them to per-
ish. And it came to pass that they
did all these things according to the
commandment of the king, Heth.

30 And it came to pass that there
began to be a great dearth upon the
land, and the inhabitants began to be
destroyed exceedingly fast because

 

of the dearth, for there was no rain
upon the face of the earth.

31 And there came forth poison-
ous serpents also upon the face of
the land, and did poison many peo-
ple. And it came to pass that their
flocks began to flee before the poi-
sonous serpents, towards the land
â€™southward, which was called by
the Nephites Zarahemla.

32 And it came to pass that there
were many of them which did per-
ish by the way; nevertheless, there
were some which fled into the land
southward.

33 And it came to pass that the
Lord did cause the serpents that
they should pursue them no more,
but that they should hedge up the
way that the people could not pass,
that whoso should attempt to pass
might fall by the poisonous serpents.

34 And it came to pass that the
people did follow the course of the
beasts, and did devour the carcasses
of them which fell by the way, until
they had devoured them all. Now
when the people saw that they must
>perish they began to repent of their
iniquities and cry unto the Lord.

35 And it came to pass that when
they had humbled themselves suffi-
ciently before the Lord he did send
rain upon the face of the earth; and
the people began to revive again,
and there began to be fruit in the
north countries, and in all the coun-
tries round about. And the Lord did
show forth his power unto them in
preserving them from famine.

CHAPTER 10

One king succeeds another.Some of the
kings are righteous; others are wicked.
When righteousness prevails, the people
are blessed and prospered by the Lord.

AND it came to pass that Shez, who
was a descendant of Heth.for
