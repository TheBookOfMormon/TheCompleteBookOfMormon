7 And the Lord said unto Mosiah:
Let them go up, for many shall
believe on their words, and they
shall have eternal life; and I will
deliver thy sons out of the hands
of the Lamanites.

8 And it came to pass that Mosiah
granted that they might go and do
according to their request.

9 And they took their journey into
the wilderness to go up to preach
the word among the Lamanites;
and I shall give an account of their
proceedings hereafter.

10 Now king Mosiah had no one to
confer the kingdom upon, for there
was not any of his sons who would
accept of the kingdom.

11 Therefore he took the records
which were engraven on the plates
of brass, and also the plates of
â€™Nephi, and all the things which he
had kept and preserved according
to the commandments of God, after
having translated and caused to be
written the records which were on
the plates of gold which had been
found by the people of Limhi, which
were delivered to him by the hand
of Limhi;

12 And this he did because of the
great anxiety of his people; for they
were desirous beyond measure to
know concerning those people who
had been destroyed.

13 And now he translated them
by the means of those two stones
which were fastened into the two
rims of a bow.

14 Now these things were prepared
from the beginning, and were
handed down from generation to
generation, for the purpose of in-
terpreting languages;

 

15 And they have been kept and
preserved by the hand of the Lord,
that he should discover to every
creature who should possess the
land the iniquities and abomina-
tions of his people;

16 And whosoever has these things
is called seer, after the manner of
old times.

17 Now after Mosiah had finished
translating these records, behold,
it gave an account of the people
who were destroyed, from the time
that they were destroyed back to
the building of the great tower, at
the time the Lord confounded the
language of the people and they
were scattered abroad upon the
face of all the earth, yea, and even
from that time back until the cre-
ation of Adam.

18 Now this account did cause the
people of Mosiah to mourn exceed-
ingly, yea, they were filled with
sorrow; nevertheless it gave them
much knowledge, in the which they
did rejoice.

19 And this account shall be writ-
ten hereafter; for behold, it is expe-
dient that all people should know
the things which are written in
this account.

20 And now, as I said unto you,
that after king Mosiah had done
these things, he took the plates of
brass, and all the things which
he had kept, and conferred them
upon Alma, who was the son of Alma;
yea, all the records, and also the
interpreters, and conferred them
upon him, and commanded him
that he should keep and preserve
them, and also keep a record of the
people, handing them down from
