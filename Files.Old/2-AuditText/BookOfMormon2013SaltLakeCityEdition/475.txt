11 And they were married, and
given in marriage, and were blessed
according to the multitude of the
promises which the Lord had made
unto them.

12 And they did not walk any more
after the performances and ordi-
nances of the law of Moses; but they
did walk after the commandments
which they had received from their
Lord and their God, continuing in
fasting and prayer, and in meet-
ing together oft both to pray and
to hear the word of the Lord.

13 And it came to pass that there
was no contention among all the
people, in all the land; but there
were mighty miracles wrought
among the disciples of Jesus.

14 And it came to pass that the sev-
enty and first year passed away, and
also the seventy and second year,
yea, and in fine, till the seventy and
ninth year had passed away; yea,
even an hundred years had passed
away, and the disciples of Jesus,
whom he had chosen, had all gone to
the paradise of God, save it were the
three who should tarry; and there
were other disciples ordained in
their stead; and also many of that
fgeneration had passed away.

15 And it came to pass that there
was no contention in the land, be-
cause of the love of God which did
dwell in the hearts of the people.

16 And there were no envyings,
nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whore-
doms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor
any manner of lasciviousness; and
surely there could not be a hap-
pier people among all the people
who had been created by the hand
of God.

 

17 There were no robbers, nor
murderers, neither were there La-
manites, nor any manner of -ites;
but they were in one, the children
of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom
of God.

18 And how blessed were they! For
the Lord did bless them in all their
doings; yea, even they were blessed
and prospered until an hundred
and ten years had passed away; and
the first generation from Christ
had passed away, and there was no
contention in all the land.

19 And it came to pass that Nephi,
he that kept this last record, (and he
kept it upon the plates of Nephi)
died, and his son Amos kept it in
his stead; and he kept it upon the
plates of Nephi also.

20 And he kept it eighty and four
years, and there was still peace in
the land, save it were a small part
of the people who had revolted from
the church and taken upon them
the name of Lamanites; therefore
there began to be Lamanites again
in the land.

21 And it came to pass that Amos
died also, (and it was an hundred
and ninety and four years from the
coming of Christ) and his son Amos
kept the record in his stead; and
he also kept it upon the plates of
Nephi; and it was also written in the
book of Nephi, which is this book.

22 And it came to pass that two
hundred years had passed away;
and the second generation had all
passed away save it were a few.

23 And now I, Mormon, would that
ye should know that the people had
multiplied, insomuch that they were
spread upon all the face of the land,
