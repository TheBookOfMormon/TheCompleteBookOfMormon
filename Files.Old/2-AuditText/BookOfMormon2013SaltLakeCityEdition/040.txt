9 And they said unto me: We have
not; for the Lord maketh no such
thing known unto us.

10 Behold, I said unto them: How
is it that ye do not keep the com-
mandments of the Lord? How is it
that ye will perish, because of the
hardness of your hearts?

11 Do ye not remember the things
which the Lord hath said?.If ye
will not harden your hearts, and
ask me in faith, believing that
ye shall receive, with diligence in
keeping my commandments, surely
these things shall be made known
unto you.

12 Behold, I say unto you, that the
house of Israel was compared unto
an olive tree, by the Spirit of the
Lord which was in our father; and
behold are we not broken off from
the house of Israel, and are we not
a branch of the house of Israel?

13 And now, the thing which our
father meaneth concerning the
grafting in of the natural branches
through the fulness of the Gentiles,
is, that in the latter days, when our
seed shall have dwindled in un-
belief, yea, for the space of many
years, and many generations after
the Messiah shall be manifested
in body unto the children of men,
then shall the fulness of the gospel
of the Messiah come unto the Gen-
tiles, and from the Gentiles unto
the remnant of our seed.

14 And at that day shall the rem-
nant of our seed know that they
are of the house of Israel, and that
they are the covenant people of the
Lord; and then shall they know and

 

4come to the knowledge of their
forefathers, and also to the knowl-
edge of the gospel of their Redeemer,
which was ministered unto their
fathers by him; wherefore, they shall
come to the knowledge of their Re-
deemer and the very points of his
doctrine, that they may know how
to come unto him and be saved.

15 And then at that day will they
not rejoice and give praise unto
their everlasting God, their rock
and their salvation? Yea, at that day,
will they not receive the strength
and nourishment from the true
vine? Yea, will they not come unto
the true fold of God?

16 Behold, I say unto you, Yea;
they shall be remembered again
among the house of Israel; they
shall be grafted in, being a natu-
ral branch of the olive tree, into
the true olive tree.

17 And this is what our father
meaneth; and he meaneth that it
will not come to pass until after
they are scattered by the Gentiles;
and he meaneth that it shall come
by way of the Gentiles, that the
Lord may show his power unto the
Gentiles, for the very cause that he
shall be rejected of the Jews, or of
the house of Israel.

18 Wherefore, our father hath not
spoken of our seed alone, but also
of all the house of Israel, pointing
to the covenant which should be
fulfilled in the latter days; which
covenant the Lord made to our
father Abraham, saying: In thy seed
shall all the kindreds of the earth
be blessed.
