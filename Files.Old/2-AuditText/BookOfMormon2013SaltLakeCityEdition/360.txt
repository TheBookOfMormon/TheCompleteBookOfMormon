been taught by their mothers, that
if they did not doubt, God would
deliver them.

48 And they rehearsed unto me
the words of their mothers, say-
ing: We do not doubt our mothers
knew it.

49 And it came to pass that I did re-
turn with my two thousand against
these Lamanites who had pursued
us. And now behold, the armies of
Antipus had overtaken them, and
a terrible battle had commenced.

50 The army of Antipus being
weary, because of their long march
in so short a space of time, were
about to fall into the hands of the
Lamanites; and had I not returned
with my two thousand they would
have obtained their purpose.

51 For Antipus had fallen by the
sword, and many of his leaders, be-
cause of their weariness, which was
occasioned by the speed of their
march.therefore the men of Anti-
pus, being confused because of the
fall of their leaders, began to give
way before the Lamanites.

52 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites took courage, and began
to pursue them; and thus were the
Lamanites pursuing them with great
vigor when Helaman came upon
their rear with his two thousand,
and began to slay them exceedingly,
insomuch that the whole army of
the Lamanites halted and turned
upon Helaman.

53 Now when the people of An-
tipus saw that the Lamanites had
turned them about, they gathered
together their men and came again
upon the rear of the Lamanites.

54 And now it came to pass
that we, the people of Nephi, the
people of Antipus, and I with my
two thousand, did surround the
Lamanites, and did slay them; yea,
insomuch that they were compelled
to deliver up their weapons of war

 

and also themselves as prisoners
of war.

55 And now it came to pass that
when they had surrendered them-
selves up unto us, behold, I num-
bered those young men who had
fought with me, fearing lest there
were many of them slain.

56 But behold, to my great joy,
there had not one soul of them
fallen to the earth; yea, and they
had fought as if with the strength
of God; yea, never were men known
to have fought with such miracu-
lous strength; and with such mighty
power did they fall upon the Laman-
ites, that they did frighten them;
and for this cause did the Lamanites
deliver themselves up as prisoners
of war.

57 And as we had no place for our
prisoners, that we could guard them
to keep them from the armies of the
Lamanites, therefore we sent them
to the land of Zarahemla, and a part
of those men who were not slain
of Antipus, with them; and the re-
mainder I took and joined them to
my stripling Ammonites, and took
our march back to the city of Judea.

CHAPTER 57

Helaman recounts the taking of An-
tiparah and the surrender and later
the defense of Cumeni.His Ammon-
ite striplings fight valiantly; all are
wounded, but none are slain.Gid
reports the slaying and the escape of
the Lamanite prisoners. About 63 B.C.

AND now it came to pass that I re-
ceived an epistle from Ammoron,
the king, stating that if I would
deliver up those prisoners of war
whom we had taken that he would
deliver up the city of Antiparah
unto us.

2 But I sent an epistle unto the
king, that we were sure our forces
were sufficient to take the city of
