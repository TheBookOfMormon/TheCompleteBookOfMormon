and strifes, and malice, and persecu-
tions, and all manner of iniquities;
and your churches, yea, even every
one, have become polluted because
of the pride of your hearts.

37 For behold, ye do love money,
and your substance, and your fine
apparel, and the adorning of your
churches, more than ye love the
poor and the needy, the sick and
the afflicted.

38 O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites,
ye teachers, who sell yourselves for
that which will canker, why have
ye polluted the holy church of God?
Why are ye ashamed to take upon
you the name of Christ? Why do ye
not think that greater is the value
of an endless happiness than that
bmisery which never dies.because
of the praise of the world?

39 Why do ye adorn yourselves
with that which hath no life, and
yet suffer the hungry, and the needy,
and the naked, and the sick and the
afflicted to pass by you, and notice
them not?

40 Yea, why do ye build up your
secret abominations to get gain, and
cause that widows should mourn
before the Lord, and also orphans
to mourn before the Lord, and also
the blood of their fathers and their
husbands to cry unto the Lord from
the ground, for vengeance upon
your heads?

41 Behold, the sword of vengeance
hangeth over you; and the time soon
cometh that he avengeth the blood
of the saints upon you, for he will
not suffer their cries any longer.

CHAPTER 9

Moroni calls upon those who do not be-
lieve in Christ to repent.He proclaims

 

a God of miracles, who gives revelations
and pours out gifts and signs upon
the faithful.Miracles cease because
of unbelief.Signs follow those who
believe.Men are exhorted to be wise
and keep the commandments. About
A.D. 401-21.

AND now, I speak also concerning
those who do not believe in Christ.

2 Behold, will ye believe in the day
of your visitation.behold, when
the Lord shall come, yea, even that
4great day when the earth shall be
rolled together as a scroll, and the
elements shall melt with fervent
heat, yea, in that great day when
ye shall be brought to stand before
the Lamb of God.then will ye say
that there is no God?

3 Then will ye longer deny the
Christ, or can ye behold the Lamb
of God? Do ye suppose that ye shall
dwell with him under a conscious-
ness of your guilt? Do ye suppose
that ye could be happy to dwell with
that holy Being, when your souls
are racked with a consciousness
of guilt that ye have ever abused
his laws?

4 Behold, I say unto you that ye
would be more miserable to dwell
with a holy and just God, under a
consciousness of your filthiness
before him, than ye would to dwell
with the damned souls in hell.

5 For behold, when ye shall be
brought to see your nakedness be-
fore God, and also the glory of God,
and the holiness of Jesus Christ, it
will kindle a flame of unquench-
able fire upon you.

6 Othen ye unbelieving, turn ye
unto the Lord; cry mightily unto the
Father in the name of Jesus, that
perhaps ye may be found spotless,
