of the Ammonihahites was de-
stroyed, and also their great city,
which they said God could not de-
stroy, because of its greatness.

10 But behold, in one day it was
left desolate; and the carcasses were
mangled by dogs and wild beasts
of the wilderness.

11 Nevertheless, after many days
their dead bodies were heaped
up upon the face of the earth, and
they were covered with a shallow
covering. And now so great was
the scent thereof that the people
did not go in to possess the land of
Ammonihah for many years. And
it was called Desolation of Nehors;
for they were of the profession of
Nehor, who were slain; and their
lands remained desolate.

12 And the Lamanites did not come
again to war against the Nephites
until the fourteenth year of the
reign of the judges over the people
of Nephi. And thus for three years
did the people of Nephi have con-
tinual peace in all the land.

13 And Alma and Amulek went
forth preaching repentance to the
people in their temples, and in
their sanctuaries, and also in their
synagogues, which were built after
the manner of the Jews.

14 And as many as would hear
their words, unto them they did
impart the word of God, without
any respect of persons, continually.

15 And thus did Alma and Amulek
go forth, and also many more who
had been chosen for the work, to
preach the word throughout all the
land. And the establishment of the
church became general throughout

 

the land, in all the region round
about, among all the people of the
Nephites.

16 And there was no inequality
among them; the Lord did pour out
his Spirit on all the face of the land
to prepare the minds of the children
of men, or to prepare their hearts
to receive the word which should
be taught among them at the time
of his coming.

17 That they might not be hard-
ened against the word, that they
might not be unbelieving, and goon
to destruction, but that they might
receive the word with joy, and as
a branch be grafted into the true
vine, that they might enter into the
rest of the Lord their God.

18 Now those priests who did go
forth among the people did preach
against all lyings, and deceivings,
and envyings, and strifes, and
malice, and revilings, and stealing,
robbing, plundering, murdering,
committing adultery, and all man-
ner of lasciviousness, crying that
these things ought not so to be.

19 Holding forth things which
must shortly come; yea, holding
forth the coming of the Son of God,
his sufferings and death, and also
the resurrection of the dead.

20 And many of the people did in-
quire concerning the place where
the Son of God should come; and
they were taught that he would
appear unto them after his res-
urrection; and this the people did
hear with great joy and gladness.

21 And now after the church had
been established throughout all the
land.having got the victory over
