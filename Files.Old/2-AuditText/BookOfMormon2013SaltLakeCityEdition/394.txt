7 Oh, that I could have had my
days in the days when my father
Nephi first came out of the land of
Jerusalem, that I could have joyed
with him in the promised land; then
were his people easy to be entreated,
firm to keep the commandments
of God, and slow to be led to do iniq-
uity; and they were quick to hearken
unto the words of the Lord.

8 Yea, if my days could have been
in those days, then would my soul
have had joy in the righteousness
of my brethren.

9 But behold, I am consigned that
these are my days, and that my soul
shall be filled with sorrow because of
this the wickedness of my brethren.

10 And behold, now it came to pass
that it was upon a tower, which was
in the garden of Nephi, which
was by the highway which led to
the chief market, which was in the
city of Zarahemla; therefore, Nephi
had bowed himself upon the tower
which was in his garden, which
tower was also near unto the garden
gate by which led the highway.

11 And it came to pass that there
were certain men passing by and
saw Nephi as he was pouring out his
soul unto God upon the tower; and
they ran and told the people what
they had seen, and the people came
together in multitudes that they
might know the cause of so great
mourning for the wickedness of
the people.

12 And now, when Nephi arose he
beheld the multitudes of people
who had gathered together.

13 And it came to pass that he
opened his mouth and said unto
them: Behold, why have ye gath-
ered yourselves together? That I
may tell you of your iniquities?

 

14 Yea, because I have got upon
my tower that I might pour out
my soul unto my God, because of
the exceeding sorrow of my heart,
which is because of your iniquities!

15 And because of my mourning
and lamentation ye have gathered
yourselves together, and do mar-
vel; yea, and ye have great need
to marvel; yea, ye ought to marvel
because ye are given away that the
devil has got so great hold upon
your hearts.

16 Yea, how could you have given
way to the enticing of him who
is seeking to hurl away your souls
down to everlasting misery and
endless wo?

17 O repent ye, repent ye! Why
will ye die? Turn ye, turn ye unto
the Lord your God. Why has he
forsaken you?

18 It is because you have hard-
ened your hearts; yea, ye will not
hearken unto the voice of the good
shepherd; yea, ye have provoked
him to anger against you.

19 And behold, instead of gath-
ering you, except ye will repent,
behold, he shall scatter you forth
that ye shall become meat for dogs
and wild beasts.

20 O, how could you have forgot-
ten your God in the very day that
he has delivered you?

21 But behold, it is to get gain, to
be praised of men, yea, and that
ye might get gold and silver. And
ye have set your hearts upon the
riches and the vain things of this
world, for the which ye do murder,
and plunder, and steal, and bear
false witness against your neigh-
bor, and do all manner of iniquity.

22 And for this cause wo shall come
unto you except ye shall repent.
