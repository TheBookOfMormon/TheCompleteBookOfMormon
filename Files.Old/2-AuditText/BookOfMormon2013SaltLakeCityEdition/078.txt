14 And behold, according to the
words of the prophet, the Messiah
will set himself again the second
time to recover them; wherefore, he
will manifest himself unto them
in power and great glory, unto the
destruction of their enemies, when
that day cometh when they shall
believe in him; and none will he
destroy that believe in him.

15 And they that believe not in
him shall be destroyed, both by
fire, and by tempest, and by earth-
quakes, and by bloodsheds, and by
pestilence, and by famine. And
they shall know that the Lord is
God, the Holy One of Israel.

16 For shall the prey be taken
from the mighty, or the lawful
captive delivered?

17 But thus saith the Lord: Even
the captives of the mighty shall be
taken away, and the prey of the
terrible shall be delivered; for the
’Mighty God shall deliver his cov-
enant people. For thus saith the
Lord: I will contend with them that
contendeth with thee.

18 And I will feed them that
oppress thee, with their own flesh;
and they shall be drunken with
their own blood as with sweet
wine; and all flesh shall know that
I the Lord am thy Savior and thy
Redeemer, the Mighty One of
Jacob.

off forever? For thus saith the Lord:
Where is the bill of your mother’s
divorcement? To whom have I put
thee away, or to which of my 4credi-
tors have I sold you? Yea, to whom
have I sold you? Behold, for your
iniquities have ye sold yourselves,
and for your transgressions is your
mother put away.

2 Wherefore, when I came, there
was no man; when I called, yea,
there was none to answer. O house of
Israel, is my hand shortened at all
that it cannot redeem, or have I no
power to deliver? Behold, at my re-
buke I dry up the sea, I make their
rivers a wilderness and their fish
to stink because the waters are dried
up, and they die because of thirst.

3 Iclothe the heavens with black-
ness, and I make sackcloth their
covering.

4 The Lord God hath given me the
tongue of the learned, that I should
know how to speak a word in season
unto thee, O house of Israel. When
