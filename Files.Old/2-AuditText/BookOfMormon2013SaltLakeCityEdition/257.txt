18 Now as I said, Alma having
seen all these things, therefore he
took Amulek and came over to the
land of Zarahemla, and took him
to his own house, and did admin-
ister unto him in his tribulations,
and strengthened him in the Lord.

19 And thus ended the tenth year
of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

CHAPTER 16

The Lamanites destroy the people of
Ammonihah.Zoram leads the Nephites
to victory over the Lamanites.Alma
and Amulek and many others preach
the word.They teach that after His
Resurrection Christ will appear to the
Nephites. About 81-77 B.c.

AND it came to pass in the eleventh
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi, on the fifth day
of the second month, there having
been much peace in the land of
Zarahemla, there having been no
wars nor contentions for a certain
number of years, even until the
fifth day of the second month in
the eleventh year, there was a cry
of war heard throughout the land.

2 For behold, the armies of the
Lamanites had come in upon the
wilderness side, into the borders
of the land, even into the city of
Ammonihah, and began to slay the
people and destroy the city.

3 And now it came to pass, before
the Nephites could raise a sufficient
army to drive them out of the land,
they had destroyed the people who
were in the city of Ammonihah,
and also some around the borders
of Noah, and taken others captive
into the wilderness.

4 Now it came to pass that the
Nephites were desirous to obtain
those who had been carried away
captive into the wilderness.

 

5 Therefore, he that had been
appointed chief captain over the
armies of the Nephites, (and his
name was Zoram, and he had two
sons, Lehi and Aha).now Zoram
and his two sons, knowing that Alma
was high priest over the church,
and having heard that he had the
spirit of prophecy, therefore they
went unto him and desired of him
to know whither the Lord would
that they should go into the wil-
derness in search of their brethren,
who had been taken captive by the
Lamanites.

6 And it came to pass that Alma
inquired of the Lord concerning
the matter. And Alma returned
and said unto them: Behold, the
Lamanites will cross the river Sidon
in the south wilderness, away up
beyond the borders of the land of
â€™Manti. And behold there shall ye
meet them, on the east of the river
Sidon, and there the Lord will de-
liver unto thee thy brethren who
have been taken captive by the
Lamanites.

7 And it came to pass that Zoram
and his sons crossed over the river Si-
don, with their armies, and marched
away beyond the borders of Manti
into the south wilderness, which was
on the east side of the river Sidon.

8 And they came upon the armies
of the Lamanites, and the Laman-
ites were scattered and driven into
the wilderness; and they took their
brethren who had been taken cap-
tive by the Lamanites, and there was
not one soul of them had been lost
that were taken captive. And they
were brought by their brethren to
possess their own lands.

9 And thus ended the eleventh
year of the judges, the Lamanites
having been driven out of the land,
and the people of Ammonihah were
4destroyed; yea, every living soul
