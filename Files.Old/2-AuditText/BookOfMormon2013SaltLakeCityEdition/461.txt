â€™cut off from among my people, O
house of Israel;

21 And I will execute vengeance
and fury upon them, even as upon
the heathen, such as they have not
heard.

22 But if they will repent and heark-
en unto my words, and harden not
their hearts, I will establish my
church among them, and they shall
come in unto the covenant and be
numbered among this the remnant
of Jacob, unto whom I have given
this land for their inheritance;

23 And they shall assist my peo-
ple, the remnant of Jacob, and also
as many of the house of Israel as
shall come, that they may build a
city, which shall be called the New
Jerusalem.

24 And then shall they assist my
people that they may be gathered
in, who are scattered upon all the
face of the land, in unto the New
Jerusalem.

25 And then shall the power of
heaven come down among them;
and I also will be in the midst.

26 And then shall the work of
the Father commence at that day,
even when this gospel shall be
preached among the remnant of
this people. Verily I say unto you,
at that day shall the work of the
Father commence among all the
dispersed of my people, yea, even the
tribes which have been lost, which
the Father hath led away out of
Jerusalem.

27 Yea, the work shall commence
among all the dispersed of my

 

people, with the Father to prepare
the way whereby they may come
unto me, that they may call on the
Father in my name.

28 Yea, and then shall the work
commence, with the Father among
all nations in preparing the way
whereby his people may be gath-
ered home to the land of their in-
heritance.

29 And they shall go out from all
nations; and they shall not go out
in haste, nor go by flight, for I will
go before them, saith the Father,
and I will be their rearward.

CHAPTER 22

In the last days, Zion and her stakes
will be established, and Israel will be
gathered in mercy and tenderness.
They will triumph.Compare Isaiah
54. About A.D. 34.

AND then shall that which is writ-
ten come to pass: Sing, O barren,
thou that didst not bear; break forth
into singing, and cry aloud, thou
that didst not travail with child;
for more are the children of the
desolate than the children of the
married wife, saith the Lord.

2 Enlarge the place of thy tent,
and let them stretch forth the cur-
tains of thy habitations; spare not,
lengthen thy cords and strengthen
thy stakes;

3 For thou shalt break forth on
the right hand and on the left, and
thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles
and make the desolate cities to be
inhabited.
