of it did make many swords, lest
by any means the people who were
now called Lamanites should come
upon us and destroy us; for I knew
their hatred towards me and my
children and those who were called
my people.

15 And I did teach my people to
build buildings, and to work in
all manner of wood, and of iron,
and of copper, and of brass, and
of steel, and of gold, and of silver,
and of precious ores, which were
in great abundance.

16 And I, Nephi, did build a
temple; and I did construct it af-
ter the manner of the temple of
Solomon save it were not built of
so many precious things; for they
were not to be found upon the land,
wherefore, it could not be built like
unto Solomon’s temple. But the
manner of the construction was
like unto the temple of Solomon;
and the workmanship thereof was
exceedingly fine.

17 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, did cause my people to be
industrious, and to labor with their
hands.

18 And it came to pass that they
would that I should be their king.
But I, Nephi, was desirous that they
should have no king; nevertheless,
I did for them according to that
which was in my power.

19 And behold, the words of the
Lord had been fulfilled unto my

 

brethren, which he spake concern-
ing them, that I should be their
ruler and their teacher. Wherefore,
I had been their ruler and their
’teacher, according to the command-
ments of the Lord, until the time
they sought to take away my life.

20 Wherefore, the word of the Lord
was fulfilled which he spake unto
me, saying that: Inasmuch as they
will not hearken unto thy words
they shall be cut off from the pres-
ence of the Lord. And behold, they
were cut off from his presence.

21 And he had caused the curs-
ing to come upon them, yea, even
a sore cursing, because of their in-
iquity. For behold, they had hard-
ened their hearts against him, that
they had become like unto a flint;
wherefore, as they were white, and
exceedingly fair and delightsome,
that they might not be enticing
unto my people the Lord God did
cause a skin of blackness to come
upon them.

22 And thus saith the Lord God: 1
will cause that they shall be loath-
some unto thy people, save they
shall repent of their iniquities.

23 And cursed shall be the seed of
him that mixeth with their seed;
for they shall be cursed even with
the same cursing. And the Lord
spake it, and it was done.

24 And because of their cursing
which was upon them they did
become an idle people, full of
