these things, and that ye should
work out your salvation with fear
before God, and that ye should no
more deny the coming of Christ;

38 That ye contend no more
against the Holy Ghost, but that ye
receive it, and take upon you the
â€™name of Christ; that ye humble your-
selves even to the dust, and worship
God, in whatsoever place ye may be
in, in spirit and in truth; and that
ye live in thanksgiving daily, for
the many mercies and blessings
which he doth bestow upon you.

39 Yea, and Lalso exhort you, my
brethren, that ye be watchful unto
prayer continually, that ye may not
be led away by the temptations
of the devil, that he may not over-
power you, that ye may not become
his subjects at the last day; for be-
hold, he rewardeth you no good
thing.

40 And now my beloved brethren, I
would exhort you to have patience,
and that ye bear with all manner
of afflictions; that ye do not revile
against those who do cast you out
because of your exceeding pov-
erty, lest ye become sinners like
unto them;

41 But that ye have patience, and
bear with those afflictions, with a
firm hope that ye shall one day rest
from all your afflictions.

CHAPTER 35

The preaching of the word destroys
the craft of the Zoramites.They expel
the converts, who then join the people
of Ammon in Jershon.Alma sorrows
because of the wickedness of the people.
About 74 B.C.

Now it came to pass that after
Amulek had made an end of these

 

words, they withdrew themselves
from the multitude and came over
into the land of Jershon.

2 Yea, and the rest of the brethren,
after they had preached the word
unto the Zoramites, also came over
into the land of Jershon.

3 And it came to pass that after
the more popular part of the Zor-
amites had consulted together con-
cerning the words which had been
preached unto them, they were an-
gry because of the word, for it did
destroy their craft; therefore they
would not hearken unto the words.

4 And they sent and gathered
together throughout all the land
all the people, and consulted with
them concerning the words which
had been spoken.

5 Now their rulers and their priests
and their teachers did not let the
people know concerning their
desires; therefore they found out
privily the minds of all the people.

6 And it came to pass that after
they had found out the minds of
all the people, those who were in
favor of the words which had been
spoken by Alma and his brethren
were cast out of the land; and they
were many; and they came over
also into the land of Jershon.

7 And it came to pass that Alma
and his brethren did minister unto
them.

8 Now the people of the Zoram-
ites were angry with the people of
Ammon who were in Jershon, and
the chief ruler of the Zoramites,
being a very wicked man, sent over
unto the people of Ammon desiring
them that they should cast out of
