first began to preach to the Amale-
kites. And he began to preach to
them in their synagogues, for they
had built synagogues after the or-
der of the Nehors; for many of the
Amalekites and the Amulonites
were after the order of the Nehors.

5 Therefore, as Aaron entered into
one of their synagogues to preach
unto the people, and as he was
speaking unto them, behold there
arose an Amalekite and began to
contend with him, saying: What is
that thou hast testified? Hast thou
seen an angel? Why do not angels
appear unto us? Behold are not
this people as good as thy people?

6 Thou also sayest, except we re-
pent we shall perish. How knowest
thou the thought and intent of our
hearts? How knowest thou that we
have cause to repent? How knowest
thou that we are not arighteous peo-
ple? Behold, we have built sanctu-
aries, and we do assemble ourselves
together to worship God. We do
believe that God will save all men.

7 Now Aaron said unto him: Be-
lievest thou that the Son of God
shall come to redeem mankind
from their sins?

8 And the man said unto him: We
do not believe that thou knowest
any such thing. We do not believe
in these foolish traditions. We do
not believe that thou knowest of
things to come, neither do we be-
lieve that thy fathers and also that
our fathers did know concerning
the things which they spake, of that
which is to come.

9 Now Aaron began to open the
scriptures unto them concern-
ing the coming of Christ, and also
concerning the resurrection of the
dead, and that there could be no
redemption for mankind save it

 

were through the death and suffer-
ings of Christ, and the atonement of
his blood.

10 And it came to pass as he began.
to expound these things unto them
they were angry with him, and be-
gan to mock him; and they would
not hear the words which he spake.

11 Therefore, when he saw that
they would not hear his words, he
departed out of their synagogue,
and came over to a village which
was called Ani-Anti, and there he
found Muloki preaching the word
unto them; and also Ammah and
his brethren. And they contended
with many about the word.

12 And it came to pass that they
saw that the people would harden
their hearts, therefore they departed
and came over into the land of
Middoni. And they did preach the
word unto many, and few believed
on the words which they taught.

13 Nevertheless, Aaron and a cer-
tain number of his brethren were
taken and cast into prison, and the
remainder of them fled out of the
land of Middoni unto the regions
round about.

14 And those who were cast into
prison suffered many things, and
they were delivered by the hand
of Lamoni and Ammon, and they
were fed and clothed.

15 And they went forth again to
declare the word, and thus they were
delivered for the first time out of
prison; and thus they had suffered.

16 And they went forth whither-
soever they were led by the Spirit
of the Lord, preaching the word
of God in every synagogue of the
Amalekites, or in every assembly
of the Lamanites where they could
be admitted.

17 And it came to pass that the
