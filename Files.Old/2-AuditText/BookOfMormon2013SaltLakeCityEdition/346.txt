9 But behold, this was a critical
time for such contentions to be
among the people of Nephi; for be-
hold, Amalickiah had again stirred
up the hearts of the people of the
Lamanites against the people of
the Nephites, and he was gathering
together soldiers from all parts of
his land, and arming them, and pre-
paring for war with all diligence; for
he had sworn to drink the blood
of Moroni.

10 But behold, we shall see that
his promise which he made was
rash; nevertheless, he did prepare
himself and his armies to come to
battle against the Nephites.

11 Now his armies were not so
great as they had hitherto been, be-
cause of the many thousands who
had been slain by the hand of the
Nephites; but notwithstanding their
great loss, Amalickiah had gathered
together a wonderfully great army,
insomuch that he feared not to come
down to the land of Zarahemla.

12 Yea, even Amalickiah did him-
self come down, at the head of the
Lamanites. And it was in the twenty
and fifth year of the reign of the
judges; and it was at the same time
that they had begun to settle the
affairs of their contentions con-
cerning the chief judge, Pahoran.

13 And it came to pass that when
the men who were called king-
men had heard that the Laman-
ites were coming down to battle
against them, they were glad in their
hearts; and they refused to take up
arms, for they were so wroth with
the chief judge, and also with the
people of liberty, that they would
not take up arms to defend their
country.

14 And it came to pass that when
Moroni saw this, and also saw that
the Lamanites were coming into the
borders of the land, he was exceed-
ingly wroth because of the stub-

 

bornness of those people whom he
had labored with so much diligence
to preserve; yea, he was exceedingly
wroth; his soul was filled with an-
ger against them.

15 And it came to pass that he sent
a petition, with the voice of the peo-
ple, unto the governor of the land,
desiring that he should read it, and
give him (Moroni) power to compel
those dissenters to defend their
country or to put them to death.

16 For it was his first care to put
an end to such contentions and
dissensions among the people; for
behold, this had been hitherto a
cause of all their destruction. And
it came to pass that it was granted
according to the voice of the people.

17 And it came to pass that Moroni
commanded that his army should
go against those king-men, to pull
down their pride and their nobil-
ity and level them with the earth,
or they should take up arms and
support the cause of liberty.

18 And it came to pass that the
armies did march forth against
them; and they did pull down their
pride and their nobility, insomuch
that as they did lift their weapons
of war to fight against the men of
Moroni they were hewn down and
leveled to the earth.

19 And it came to pass that there
were four thousand of those dis-
senters who were hewn down by the
sword; and those of their leaders
who were not slain in battle were
taken and cast into prison, for
there was no time for their trials at
this period.

20 And the remainder of those
dissenters, rather than be smitten
down to the earth by the sword,
yielded to the standard of liberty,
and were compelled to hoist the
title of liberty upon their towers,
and in their cities, and to take up
arms in defence of their country.
