me, and been with me in my minisiry, do not ask the Father
in my name, that they may reccive a knowledge of you by the
Holy Ghost, and also of the other tribes which they know not
of, that these sayings which ye shall write, shall be kept, and
shall be manifested unto the Gentiles, that through’ the fulness
of the Gentiles, the remnant of their sced which ‘shall be seat-
tered forth upon the face of the earth, because of their unbe~
lief, may he brought in, or may be brouglit to a knowledge of
me, their Redeemer. And then will 1 gather them in from the
four quarters of the carth; and then will J fulfil the covenant
which the Father hath made unto all the people of the house
of Isracl. And blessed are the Gentiles, because of their be-
lief in me, in and of the Holy Ghost, which witness unto them
of me and of the Father. Behold, because of their belief in
me, saith the Father, and hecause of the unbelief of you, O
house of Israel, in the latter day shall the truth come unto the
Gentiles, that the fulness of these things shall be made known
unto them. But Wo, saith the Father, unto the unbelieving of
the Gentiles: for notwithstanding that ihey have come forth
upon the face of thisland, and have scattered my people, which
ate of the house of Israel; and my people which are of the
house of Israel, have been cast out from among them, and
have been trodden under feet by them; and because of the
mercies of the Father unto the Gentiles, and also the judge-
ments of the Father upon my people, which are of the house
of Isracl, verily, verily, 1 say unto you, That after all this, and
Thave caused my people which are of the house of Israel,
to be smitten, and to be afilicted, and to be slain, and to be cast
out from among them, and to become hated by them, and to
become a hiss and a by-word among them. And thus com-~
mandeth the Father that I should say unto you at that day,
When the Gentiles shall sin against my Gospel, and shall re~
ject the fulness of my Gospel, and shall be lifted up in the
pride of their hearts above all nations, and above all the peo-
ple of the whole earth, and shall be filled with all manner of
lyings, and of deceits, and of mischicfs, and all manner of hy-
pocrisy, and murders, and priestcrafis, and. whoredoms,

of secret abominations; and if they shall do all these things,
and shall reject the fulness of my Gospel, behold, saith the
Father, 1 will bring the fulness of my Gospel from among
them; and then will I remember my covenant which T have
made unto thy people, O house of Israel, and I will bring my
Gospel unto them; and I will shew anto thee, O house of Ts-
