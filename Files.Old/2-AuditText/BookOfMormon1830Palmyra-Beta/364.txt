was in part re-built, and because the Lamanites had destroyei)
3t once because of the iniguity of the people, they supposed
that it would again become an ersy prey for then. But he:
hold, how. great was their disappomtment; for behold, the
Nephites had dug up aridge of earth round about them, |
which was so high that the Lamanites could not cast ther
stones and their arrows at them, that they might take effect:
neither could they come upon them, save it was by their place
of entrance. Now at this'time, the Chief Captains of the La.
manites were astonished excecdingly, because of the wisdom
ofthe Nephites in preparing their places of security. Now
the leaders of the Lamanites had supposed, because of the
greatness of their numbers; yea, they supposed that they
should be privileged to come upon them as they had hitherio
done; yea, end they had also prepared themselves with shields,

be did care not for the blood of his people. But behold, Ama-

Chief Captains durst not attack the Nephites at the city of
Ammonibah, for Moroni had altered the management of affairs
among the Nephites, insomuch that the Lamanites were dis-
appointed in their places of retreat, and they could not come
upon them; therefore they retreated into the wilderness, and
took their camp, and marched towards the land of Noah,
supposing that to be the next best place for them to come
against the Nophites ; for they knew not that Moroni had for-

round about; therefore they marched forward to the land of -
Noah, witha firm. determination; yea, their Chief Captains
