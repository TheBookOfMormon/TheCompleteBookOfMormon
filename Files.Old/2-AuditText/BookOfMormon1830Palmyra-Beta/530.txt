and of children, and did offer them up as sacrifices unto their
idol gods. And it came to pass that in the three hundred and
sixty and seventh.year, the Nephites being angry because the
Lamanites had sacrificed their women and their children, that
they did go against the Lamanites with exceeding great anger
insomuch that they did beat again the Lamanites, and drive
them out of their lands; and the Lamanites did not come again
against the Nephites, until the three hundred and seventy an)
fifth year. And in this year they did come down against the
