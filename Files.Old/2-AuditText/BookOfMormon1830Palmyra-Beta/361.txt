went in unto the queen, unto the place where she sat; and
they all testified unto her that the king was slain by his own
servants; and they said, also, They have fled: Does not this
iestify against them? And thus they satisfied the queen con-
cerning the death of the king.

And it came to pass that Amalickiah sought the favor of the
queen, and took her unto him to wife; and thus by his fraud,
and hy the assistance of his cunning servants, he obtained the
kingdom ; yea, he was acknowledged king throughout all the
land, among all the people of the Lamanites, which was com-

osed of the Lamanites, and the Lemuelites, and the Ishmael-
tes, and all the dissenters of the Nephites, from the reign of
Nephi down to the present time. Now these dissenters, hav-

the people which were in the land; the Nephites as well as
the Lamanites; therefore he had accomplished his design ; for
he had hardened the hearts of the Lamanites, and blinded
thelr minds, and stirred them up to anger, insomuch that he
had gathered together a numerous host, to go to battle against
the Nephites. For he was determined, because of the great-
ness of the number of his people, to overpower the Nephites,
and to bring them into bondage; and thus he did appoint
Chief Captains of the Zoramites, they being the most acquaint-

and the weakest parts of their cities ; therefore he appointed
them tobe Chief Captains over his armies.
