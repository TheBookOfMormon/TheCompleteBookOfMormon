Now the decrees of God are unalterable ; therefore the way is
prepared, that whosoever will, may wail therein and be saved.
jad now behold, my son, do uot risk one more offence against
your God upon those points of doctrine, which ye hath hith-
aio risked to commit sin. Do not suppose, because it hath
been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored
fot sin to happiness. Behold I say unio you, Wickedness
neyer was happiness. And now, my son, all men that are in
avlate of nature, or | would say, in a carnal state, are im the
gal of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity ; they are with-
out God in the world, and they have gone contrary to the na-
tureol God; therefore they are in a state contrary to the nature
ofhappiness. And now bedold, is the meaning of the word
restoration, to take a thing of a natural state, and place it in
aunnaiural state, or to place it in a state opposite to its na-
te? O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of
the word restoration, is to bring back again evil for evil, or
tamal for carnal, or devilish for devilish; yood for that which
isgood; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that
Which is just; merciful for that which is merciful; therefore,
hy son, see that ye are merciful unto your brethren; deal
jusily, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye
doall these things, then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye
shall have merey restored uato you again; ye shall have jus-
tverestored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous jadgment
restored unto yon again; and ye shall have good rewarded
uno you again: for that which ye doth send out, shell retum
unto you again, and be restored; therefore the word rextora-
fon, more fully condemneth-the sinuer, and justifieth him not
at all.

And now, my son, I perceive there is someswhat more which
doth worry your mind, which ye cannot understaad, which is
tonceruing the justice of God, in the punishment of the sinner:
for ye do try to suppose that it is injustice that whe sinner
show be consizned to a state of misery. Now behold, my
son, I will explain this thing unto th for behold, after the

ort God sent our first parents forth from the garden of Eden
otill the ground, from whence he was taken; yea, he drew
on the man, and be placed at the east end of the garden of

len, Cherubims, and a flaming sword which (armed every
Way, to keep the tree of life. Now we see thet the man had
fame as Gord, knowing good and evil; and lest he should
forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat,
