as the Lord liveth, as many of the Lamanites as believed j,
their preaching, and were converted unto the Lord, never dij
fall away, for they became a righteous people; they did Ig
down the weapons of their rebellion, that they did not fig
against God no more, neither against any of their brethren.
Now these are they which were converted unto the Lord: The
people of the Lamanites which were in the land of Ishmael,
and also of the people of the Lamanites which were in the Jan
of Middoni, and also of the people of the Lamanites which
were in the city ef Nephi, and also of the people of the Laman
