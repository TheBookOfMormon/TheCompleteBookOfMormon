| do, because of your afflictions ; and he hath spoken somewhat:
uito you fo prepare your minds; yea, and he hath exhorted
| you unto faith, and to patience ; yea, even that ye would have
so much faith as even to/plant the word in your hearts, that
may try the experiment of its goodness; and we have be-
| ield that the great question which is in your minds, is wheth-
trthe word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be
no Christ, And ye also beheld that my brother hath proven
unto you, in many instances, that the word is in Christ, unto
silvation. My brother hath called upon the words of Zenos,
at redemption cometh through the Son of God, and also up-
on the words of Zenock ; and also he hath appealed unto Mo-
ws, to prove that these things are true. And now behold, I
wil testify unto you of myself, that these things are true.—
| Behold, I say unto you, that 1 do know that Christ shall come
among the'children of inen, to take upon him the transeress-
ins of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the
world; for the Lord God hath spoken it; for it is expedient
that an atonement should be made ; for according to the great
plan of the Erernal God, there must be an atonement made, or
tse all mankind must unaveidably perish ; yea, all are hard-
med; yea, all arc fallen, and are Jost, and must perish, except
ithe through the atonement which it is expedient should be
made; for it is expedient that there should be a great and last
sarifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither
ofany manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice ;
bit it must be an Infinite and an-Eternal sacrifice. Now there
snot any man that can sacrifice his own blood, which will
done for the sins of another. Now if a man murdereth, be-
hold, will our law, which ts just, take the life of bis brother?
fay unto you Nay. But the law requireth the life of him who
hath murdered ; therefore there ean nothing, which is short of
Infinite atonement, which will suilice for the sins of the
World; therefore it is expedient that there should be a great
ind last sacrifice ; and then shall there he, or it is expedient’
there should be, a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall
the law of Moses be fulfilled ; yea, it shall all be fulfilled; ey-
Syget and tittle, and none shall have passed away. And he-
this is the whole meaning of the law; every whit a point-
that great and last sacrilice ; and that great and last sac-
will he the Son of God; yea, Infinite and Eternal; and
®he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on
oes this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring.”
