yartake of his goodness ? Behold, I say unto you, nay; butâ€™
all men ave privileged the one like unto the other, and none
are forvidden. He commandeth that there shall be no priest-
crafts; for, behold, priest-crafts are that men preach and set
themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get
gain, and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare
of Zion. Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; where-
fore, the Lord God hath given a commandment, that alt men
should have charity, which charity is love. And except they
should have charity, they were nothing: wherefore, if they
should have charity, they would not suffer the laborer in Zion
fo perish. But the laborer in Zion, shall labor for Zion;
for if they lahor for money, they shall perish. And, again, the
Lord God hath commanded that men should not murder; that
that they should not lie; that they should not steal; that they
should not take the name of the Lord their God in vain; that
they should not envy; that they should not have malice ; that
they should not contend one with another; that they should not
commit whoredoms ; and that they should do none of these
things ; for whoso doeth them, shall perish; for none of these

shall come upon this land, and they which shall be upon other
tands; yea, even upon all the lands of the earth; behold, they
will be drunken with iniquity, and all manner of abominations;
and when that day shall come, they shall be visited of the
Lord of hosts, with thunder and with earthquake, and with a
great noise, and with storm and tempest, and with the flame of
devouring fire; and all the nations that fight against Zion, and
that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it
shall be unto them, even as unto a hungry man, which dream-
eth, and behold he eateth, but he awaketh and his soul is empty;
or like unto a thirsty man, which dreameth, and. behold he
drinketh, but he awaketh, and behold he is faint, and his soul
hath appetite ; yea, even so shall the multitude of all the na-
Hons be that fight against mount Zion: for behold, all. ye that
