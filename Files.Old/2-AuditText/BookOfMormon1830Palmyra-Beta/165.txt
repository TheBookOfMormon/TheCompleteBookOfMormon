eometh to none such, except it be through repentance and fait

on the Lord Jesus Christ. And the Lord God hath sent his
Holy Prophets among all the children of meh, to declare these
things to every kindred, nation, and tongue, that thereby who-
soevér should believe that Christ should come, the same might
receive remission of their sins, and rejoice with exceeding
great joy, even as though he had already come among them.
Yet the Lord.God saw that his people were a atiffnecked peo-
ple, and he appointed,unto them a Jaw, even the law of Moses.
And many signs, and wonders, and types, and shadows shew-
ed he unto them, concerning hiscomimg; and also Holy Proph-
ets spake unto them concerning bis coming; and yet they har-
dened their hearts, and understood not that the law of Moses
availeth nothing, except it were through the atonement of his
bloou; and even if it were possible that little children could
sin, they could not be saved; but I say unto yon, they are

moreover, I say wito you, that the time shall come, when the
knowledge of a Saviour shall spread throughout every nation,
