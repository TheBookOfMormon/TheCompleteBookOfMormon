him that serveth him not. For behold, the day cometh, that
shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do
wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn
them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them nei-
ther root nor branch.

But unto you that fear my name, shall the Son of righteous-
ness arise with healings in bis wings; and ye shall go forth,
and grow up as calves in the stall. And ye shall tread down
the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your
feet in‘the day that F shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts.
Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I command-
ed unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judge-
ments. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the
coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall
turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of
the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth
with a curse. ‘

And now it came to pass that when Jesus had told these
things, he expounded them unto the multitude: and he did ex-
pound all things unto them, both great and small. And he

-stith, These Scriptures which ye had not with you, the Father

commanded that I should give unto you: for it was wisdom in
him that they should he given unto future generations. And
he did expound all things, even from the beginning until the
time that he should come in his glory; yea, even all things
which should come upon the face of the earth, even until the
elements should melt with fervent heat, and the earth should
be wrapt together as a scroll, and the heavens and the
earth should pass away; and even unto the great and last day,
when all people, and all kindreds, and all nations and tongues
shall stand before God, to be judged of their works, whether
they be good or whether they he evil: if they be good, to the
resurrection of everlasting life; and if they be evil, to the res-
urrection of damnation, being on a parallel, the one on the one
hand, and the other on the other hand, according to the mercy,
and the justice, and the holiness which is in Christ, which was
before the world began. :
