the slumber of death; and loose yourselves from the pains of
hell, that ye maynot become Angels to the Devil, to be cast
into that lake of dire and brimstone, which is the second death.
And now, Jacob, spake many more things unto the people of
Nephi, warning them against fornication, and lasciviousness, .
and every kind of sin, telling them the awful consequences of
tem; and a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people,
which now began to be numerous, cannot be written upon these
