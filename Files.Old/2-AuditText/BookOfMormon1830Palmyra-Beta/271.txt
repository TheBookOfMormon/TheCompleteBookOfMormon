oyer the armies of the Nephites, (and his name was Zoram,
and-he had two sons, Lehi and Aha:) Now Zoram and his
ivosons, knowing that Alma was High Priest over the Church,
and having heard that he had the spirit of prophecy, therefore
they went unto him and desired of him to know whether the
Lord would that they should go inte the wilderness in search
d their brethren, who had been taken captive by the Laman-
ites.
And it came to pass that Alma inquired of the Lord concern-
ng the matter. And Alma returned and said unto them, Be-
hold the Lamanites will cross the river Sidon in the south wil-
demess, away up beyond the borders of the land of Manti.—
And behold there shall ye meet them, on the east of the ¥i
Sidon, and there the Lord will deliver unto thee thy brethren
which have been taken captive by the Lamanites,

And it came to pass that Zoram and his sons crossed over

 

| the river Sidon, with their armies, and marched away beyond

‘he borders of Manti, into the south wilderness, which was-on
the east side of the river Sidon. And they came upon the ar-
nies of the Lamanites, and the Lamanites were scattered and
triven into the wilderness; and they took their brethren which
had been taken captive by the Lamanites, and there was. not
te soul of them which had been lost, that were taken captive.
And they were brought by their brethren to possess their own
lads, “And thus ended the eleventh year of the Judges, the
Lamanites Wilviug been driven out of the land, and the people
of Ammonihah were destroyed; yea, every living soul of the
Atmonihahites were destroyed, and also their great City; whieh
they said God could not destroy, because of its greatness.—
But hichold, in one day it was left desolate ; and their carca-
ses Were mangled by dogs and wild beasts of the wilderness;
‘ertheless, afier many days, their dead bodies were heaped
"Pupoa the face of the earth, and they were covered with a
“ullow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof,
that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammeni-

for many years. And it was called desolation of Nehors ;
‘or they were ‘of the profession of Nehor, which were slain ;
ind their tands remained desolete. And it came to pass flat
the Lamanites did not come again to war against the Nephites
till the fourteenth year of th» reien of the Judges over the
Weople of Nevhi, And thus for three years did the people of
Nephi baye continual peace in all the land.
