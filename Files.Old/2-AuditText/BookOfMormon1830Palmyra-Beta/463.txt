itwas the custom among all the Nephites, to appoint for their
Chief Captains, save it were in their times of wickedness,
sone one that had the spirit of revelation, and also of prophe-
cy; therefore this Gidgiddoni was a great prophet among
them, and also was the Chief J udge. Now the people said
uito Gidgiddoni, Pray unto the Lord, and Jet us go up upon the
mountains, and into the wilderness, that we may fall upon the
wbbers and destroy them, in their own lands, “But Gidgiddo-
sisaith unto them, the Lord forbid; for if we should go up
gainst them, the Lord would deliver us into their bands;
therefore we will prepare ourselves in the centre of our lands,
and we will gather all our armies together, and we will not go
