much as it were in their power, according to the power of
their armies. And thus were the Nephites in those dangeroig
circumstances, in the ending of the twenty and sixth year of
the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi.

But behold, it came to pass in the twenty and seventh yeu
of the reign of the Judges, that Teancum, by the command of
Moroni, who had established armies to protect the south and
the west borders of the land, had began his march towards
the land Bountiful, that he might assist ‘Teancum with hig
men, in retaking the cities which they had lost. And it came
