because of the greatness of their number; and after they had
finished burying their dead, they all returned to their lands
and to their houses, and their wives, and their children, No
many women and children had been slain with the sword, anj

their fields of gram were destroyed, for they were trodd
down by the sof men. And now as many of the Li
“Utes and the Afnlicites which had been slain upon the bank 9
