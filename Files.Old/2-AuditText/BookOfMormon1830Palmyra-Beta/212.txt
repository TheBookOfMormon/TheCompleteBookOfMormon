when they thought upon the Lamanites, which was their hr,
ren, of thei siniul and polluted stato, they svere filled with ai
and anguish, for the welfare of their souls. 4
Ani it came to pass that when those which were the childrey

of Amulon and his brethren, which had taken to wife the du
ters of the Lamanites, they were displeased with the cond
of their fathers, and they would no longer be called by th
names of their fathers; therefore they took upon themselna
the name of Nephi, that they might be called the children g
Nephi, and be numbered among those which were called \,
phites, And now all the people of Zarahemla were number)
with the Nephites, and this because the kingdom had been coy
ferred upon none but those which were descendants of Nephi
And now it came to pass that when Mosiah wed made
end of speaking and reading to the people, he desired thatdl
ma should also speak to the people. And it came to pass thy
Alma did spealc unto them, when they were assembled togethy
in large bodies, and he went from one body to another, prea
ing unto the people repentance and faith on the Lord. Ay
he did exhort the people of Limhi and his brethren, all thoy
that had been delivered out of bondage, that they-should remen.

to pass that afier Alma had taught the people many things, al
had made an end of speaking to them, that king Limhi wa}
desirous that he might be baptized; and all lis people wey
desirous that they might be baptized also. Therefore Ali
did go forth into the water, and did baptize them; yea, he di
baptize them afier the manner he did his brethren in the water
of Moymon,; yea, and as many as he did baptize did belongt
» the Church of God; and this because of their belief on
words of Alma.
_ Andit came to pass that king Mosiah granted unto Aln
that be might establish Churches throughout all ‘the land
Zarahemla; and gave him power to ordain priests and teadl
over every Church. Now this was done because there
so many people that they could not all be governed by
teacher; neither could they all hear the word of God in
assembly; therefore they did assemble themselves together
dilferent bodies, beingcalled Churches; every Church havi
their priests and their teachers, and every priest prea
the word according as it was delivered to him by the mol
of Alma; and thus, notwithstanding there being many Chu
they were all one Church; yea, even the Church of God:!
