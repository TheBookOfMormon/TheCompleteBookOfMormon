children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that
they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them,

And it came to pass that when my father had heard these:
words, he was exceeding glad, for he knew that I had been
blessed of the Lord. And I, Nephi, and my brethren, took
our journey in the wilderness with our tents, to go up to the
land of Jerusalem.

Ail it came to pass that when we had come up to the land
of Jerusalem, I and my brethren did consult onc with another ;
and wercast lots which of us should go in unto the house of
Laban, And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman ; and
Laan went in unto the house of Laban, and he talked with
him as he sat in his house. And he desired of Laban the ree-
ords which were engraven upon the plates of brass, which con-

tained the geucalogy of my father.

And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry, and
thrust him out from his presence ; and he would not that he
should have the records. Wherefore he said unto him, behold

then art a robber, and | will slay thee, But Lamun fled out of
is presence, and told the things which Laban had done, unto

hold Tsaid unto them, that as the Lordliveth, and as we live,
we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness, until
we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath comman-
ded us, Wherefore let us be faithful in keeping the command-
ments of the Lord; therefore let us go down to the land of our
father’s inheritance, for behold he left gold and silver, and alt
manner of riches. And all this he hath done, because of the
commandmeiits of the Lord: for he knowing that Jerusalem

For behold, they have rejected the words of the prophets
Wherefore if my father should dwell in the land after that he
hath been commanded to flee out of the land, behold he would
also perish, Wherefore it must needs be that he flee out of
the land, And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should
obtain these records, that we might preserve unto our children
the language of our fathers; and also that we may preserve
unto them the words which have been spoken hy the mouth of
ail the holy prophets, which have becn delivered unto them by
the spirit and power of God, since the world began, even down
voto this present time.
