mop his fon. Bebold, David and Solomon truly had many
wives and concubines, which thing wasâ€™ abominable betore
me, saith the Lord. Wherefore, thus saith the Lord: [have
led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the

ower of mine arm, that 1 might raise up unto mea righteous
branch, from the fruit of the loins of Joseph. Wherefore, J,
the Lord God, will uot sufier that this people shall do hke
nato them of old. Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and
hearken to the word of the Lord: for there shall not any man
among you bave save jt be one wife; and coucubines he
