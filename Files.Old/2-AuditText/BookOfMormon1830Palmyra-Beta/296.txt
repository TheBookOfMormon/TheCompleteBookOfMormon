haps, if we should stain our swords again, they can nomore be
washed bright through the blood of the Son of our great God,
which shall be shed for the atonement of our sins. And the
great God has had mercy on us, and made these things know,
unto us, that we might not perish; yea, and he hath made
these things known unto us beforehand, because he loveth up
souls as well as he loveth our children; therefore in his me.
ey he doth visit us by his angels, that the plan of salvation
might be made known unto us as well as unto future gener.
tions. O how merciful is our God! And now behold, since
it has been as much as we could do to get our stains taken

lives; and rather than to take away from a brother, they would
give unto him; and rather than to spend their days in idle
ness, they would labor abundantly with theit hands; and thus
we see that when these Lamanites were drought to believe
and to know the truth, that they were firm, and would suffer
even unto death, rather than to commit sin; and thus we set,
that they buried the weapons of peace, or they buried the
weapons of war, for peace.

And it came to pass that their brethren, the Lamanites,
