and did cause us that we should hope for our deliverance in
him; and we did take courage with our sinall force which we
had received, and were fixed with a determination to conquer
our enemies, and to maintain our lands, and our possessions,
and our wives, and.our children, and the cause of our liberty.
And thus we did go forth with all our might against the La-
manites, which were in the city of Manti; and we did pitch
our tents by the wilderness side, which was near to the city.
And it came to pass that on the morrow, that when the La-
