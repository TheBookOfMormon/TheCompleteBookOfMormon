And it came to pass because of the greatness of the number
at the Lamanités, the Nephites were m great fear, Jest they
should be overpowered, and trodden down, and slain, and de-
sroyed ; yea, they began to remember the prophecies of Alina,
and also the words of Mosiah; and they saw that they had
heen a stiffnecked people, and that they had set at nought the
commandments of God ; and that they had altered and tram-
pled under their feet the laws of Mosiah, or that which the
Lord commanded him to give unto the people; and thus see-
ing that their laws had become corrupted, and that they had
become a wicked people, insomuch that they were wicked
eyen like unto the Lamanites. And because of their iniquity,
the church had began to dwindle; and they began to disbelieve
inthe spirit of prophecy, and in the spirit of revelation; and
the judgements of God did stare them in the face. And they
saw that they had become weak, like unto their brethren, the
Jamanites, and that the spirit of the Yuord did no more pre-
serve them; yea, it had withdrawn from them, because the
spit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples; there-
fore the Lord did cease to preserve them by his miraculous
and matchless power, for they had fallen inte a state of unbe-
lief and awful wickedness; and they saw that the Lamanites
were more exceeding numerous tian they, and except they
should cleave unto the Lord their God, they must unavoidably
perish, For behold, they saw that the strength of the Laman-
ites was as great as their strength, even man for man. And
thus had they fallen into this great transgression; yea, thus
liad they become weak, hecause of their transgression, in the
space of not many years. ,

And jt came to pass that in this same year, behold, Nephi
delivered up the judgement seat, te a man whose name was
Cezoram. For as their laws and their governments were es-
tablished by the voice of the people, and they which chose
evil were more numerous than they which chose good, there-
fae they were ripening for destruction, for the laws had he-
come corrupted; yea, and this was not all; they were a stiff
tteked people, insomuch that they could not be governed by
the law nor justice, save it were to their destruction,

And it came to pass that Nephi had become weary, because
Of the’ iniquity; aud he yielded up the j ment scat, and
