| fr there began to be a contention among the people concern-

dthe people which desired that a few particular points of the
yw should be altered. But behold, Pahoran would not alter,
wrsuffer the law to be altered; therefore he did not hearken
those who had sent in their voices with their petitions, con-
wming the altering of the law; therefore those which were
