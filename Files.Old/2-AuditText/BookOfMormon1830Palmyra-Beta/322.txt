things, but Zenock also spake of these things; for behold, he
saith, hou art angry, O Lord, with this peaple, because they
will ina understand of thy mercies which thou hast boston
upon them, becanse of thy Son. And now my brethren, ye
see that a second prophet of old has testified of the Sono
God; and because the people would not understand his words,
they patorred him to death. -But behold, this is not all; thes
are not the only ones which have spoken concerning the Son
of God. Behold, he was spoken of by Moses; yea, aud be
hold, a type was â€˜raised up in the wilderness, that wi hosoem
w ula look upon it might live, And many did look and five,
But few understood the meaning of those things, and this he
cause of the hardness of their hearts. But there were many
which were so hardened that they would not look; therefor

may be light, through the joy of his Son. And even all thy
can ye do, if ye will, Amen.

And now it came to pass that after Alma had spoken thes

arose and began to teach them, s saying: My brethren, 1 think
that it is impossible that ye should be ignorant of the things
which have been spoken concerning the coming of
