 

And it came to pass that in the ninety and fourth year, they
began to increase in a great degree, because there were many
dissenters of the Nephites which did flee unto them, which
did cause much sorrow unto those Nephites which did remain
in the land; and there was also a cause of much sorrow among
the Lamanites: for behold, they had many children which did
grow up and began to wax strong in years, that they became
for themselves, and were led away by some which were Zo-
ramites, by their lyings and their flattering words, to join those
Gadianton robbers ; and thus were the Lamanitcs afflicted al-
so, and began to decrease as to their faith and rightcousness,
because of the wickedness of the rising generation.

And it came to pass that thus passed away the ninety and

and also the ninety and seventh year ; and also the ninety and
eighth year; and also the nincty and ninth year; and also an
hundred years had passed away, since the days of Mosiah,
which was king over the people of the Nephites. And six
hundred and nine years had passed away, since Lehi left Je-
tusalem; and nine years had passed away, from the time
which the sign was given, which was spoken of by the pro yh-
