lost, but all things shall be restored to its proper and perfect
frame, And now my son, this is tie restoration of which hes
been spoken by the mouths of the prophets: And then shalj
the righteous shine forth in the Kingdom of God. But behold
an awful death cometh upon the wicked ; for they die as t
things pertaining to things of righteousness; for they are up
clean, and no unclean thing can inherit the Kingdom of God:
but they are cast out, and consigned to partake of the fruits
of their labors or their works, which have been evil; and the
drink the dregs of a bitter cup.

And now mny von, | have somewhat to say concerning the
restoration of which has been spoken; for bebold, some bay
arrested the Scriptures, and have gone far astray, becauseof
this thing. And perceive that thy mind hath been wormed
also, concerning this thing. But behold, ¥ will explain it un
thee. Isay unto thee, my son, that the plan of restoration’:
requisite with the justice of God; for it is requisite thatall
things should be restored to their proper order. Behold, its
requisite and just, according to ihe power and resurrection d
Christ, that {he soul of man should he restored to its body, ant
that every part of the body should be restored to itxell-
And it is requisite with the justice of God, that men shoud
be judged according to their works ; and if their warks wer
good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were gool,
that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto tha
which is good ; and it their works are evil, they shall be m
stored unto him for evil; therefore, all things shall be restored
to their proper order; every thing to its natural frame; mor
tality raised to immortality ; corruption to incorruption; ri
sed to endless happiness, to inherit the Kingdom of God, orlo
endless misery, to inherit the kingdom of the Devil; the ot
on one hand, the other on the other; the one raised to hap
ness, according to his desires of happiness; or good, accorditg
to his desires of good ; and the other to evil, according to his
desires of evil; for as he has desired to do evil all the day
long, even so shall he have his reward of evil, when the nigh
cometh, And so itis on the other hand. If he hath repent
of his sins, and desired righteousness until the end of his
deys, even so le shall be. rewarded unto righteousness
These are they that are redeemed of the Lord; yea, these at
they the! are taken out, that sre delivered from that endles
night of darkness; and thus they stand or fall; for beliold |
they are their own judges, whether to do good or do evil=
