behold, f remembered also to have heard ny father prophecy
uno the people, concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ,
a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world. Now as my
mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart,
0 Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who art in the
gall of bitterness, and art encircled about by the everlasting
chains of death. And now behold, when } thought this, 1
could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up
by the memory of my sins no more. And O, what Joy, anc
what marvellous light I did behold; yea, my sou! was filled
with joy as exceeding as wasmy pain; yea, I say unto you, my
son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter, as
was my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, iny son, that
onthe other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet
as was my joy; yea, and methought I saw even as our father
Lehi saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with num-

But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I

the fruit of my labors; for because of the word which he hath
imparted unto me, behold, many hath been born of God, and
hath tasted as I have tasted, and hath seen eye to eye, as T
have seen; therefore they do know of these things of which
Thave spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I
have is of God. And I have been supported under trials and
troubles of every kind, yea, and in all manner of afflictions;
yea, God hath delivered me from prison, and from bonds, and
ftom death; yea, and I do put my trust in him, and he wilt
still deliver me; and I know that he will raise me up at the
hist day, to dwell with him in glory; yea, and J will praise
him forever, for he hath brought our fathers out of Egypt, and
le hath swallowed up the Egyptians in the red sea; and-he
led them hy his power into the promised land; yea, and he
hath delivered them out of bondage and captivity, from fime to
lime; yea, and he hath also brought our fathers out of the
