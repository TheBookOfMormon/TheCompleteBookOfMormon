unto the remission of your sine, that ye became holy without
spot. And now J bid unto all, farewell. Isoon go to rest
in the paradise of God, until my spirit and body shall again
reunite, and I am brought forth triumphant through the air, to
meet you before the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the
Kternal Judge of both quick and dead, Amen,

THE END,
