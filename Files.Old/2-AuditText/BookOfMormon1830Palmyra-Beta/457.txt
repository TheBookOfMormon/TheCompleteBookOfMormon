make a great uproar throughout the land; and the people
which believed, began to be very sorrowful, lest by any means
those things which had been spoken, might not come to pass.
But behold, they did watch steadfastly for that day, and that
night, and that day, which shall be as one day, as if there were
no night, that they might know that their faith had not been
vain.

Now it came to pass that there was a day set apart by the
unbelievers, that all those who believed in those traditions,
should be put to death, except the sign should come to pass,
which had been given by Samucl the prophet. Now it came
to pass that when Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw this wicked-

at the going down of the sun, there was no darkness ; and the |

people began to be astonished, because (here was no darkness
