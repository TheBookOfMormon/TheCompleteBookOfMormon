would have been better that they had died, before they came
out of Jerusalem, than to have suffered these afflictions. Be
hold, these many years we have suffered in the wilderness
which time we might have enjoyed our possessions, and the
land of our inheritance ; yea, and we might have been happy;
and we know that the people which were in the land of Jernsa:
jem, were a righteous people; for they kept the statutes and fhe
judgments of the Lord, and all his commandments, according i¢
the law of Moses; wherefore, we know that they are a righteous

eople; and our father hath judged them, and hath led us away
Petnand we would hearken unto his words; yea, and owt
