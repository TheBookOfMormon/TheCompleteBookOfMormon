which this land; which is a land of promise unto you, and tp
your seed, doth abound most plentifully. And the hand of
Providence hath smiled upon you most pleasingly, that yoy
have obtained many riches; and because that some of you have
obtained more abundantly than that of your brethren, ye ar
lifted up in the pride of your hearts, and wear stiff Decks,
and high heads, because of the costliness of your apparel, and
persecute your brethren, because that ye suppose that ye are
better then they.

And now my brethren, do ye suppose that God justificth
you in this thing? Behold, [ say unto you, Nay. But he cop

sight as the other. And all flesh is of the dust; and for the

' self same end hath he created them, that they should keep his
commandments, and glorify him forever. And now I make
an end of speaking unto you concerning this pride. And were if
not that 1 must speak unto you concerning a grosser crimy

word of God burihens me because of your grosser crimes,
For behold, thus saith ihe Lord: This People begin 0
