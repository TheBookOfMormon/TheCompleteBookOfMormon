Je of Nephi; but whosoever remaincth, and is not des-
toyed in that great and dreadful day, shall be numbered among
he Lamanites, and shall become like unto them all, save it
jeafew, which shall be called the disciples of the Lord ; and
hem shall the Lamanites pursue, even until they shall become
«tinct. And now, because of iniquity, this prophecy shall
be fulfilled.

And now it came to pass that after Alma lad said these
things to Helama, he blessed him, and also his other sons;
wl be also blessed the earth, for the mghteous’ sake. And hie
ail, Thus saith the Lord God ; Cursed shalt be the land, yea,
ihigland, uuto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, unto
estruction, which do wickedly, when they are fully ripe; and
aT have said, so shall it be: for this is the cursing and the

Which had been among the people, it hecame expedient thai,
the word of God should be declared among them; yea, and
flat @ regiation should be made throughout the chureh ;
therefore Helaman’ and his brethren went forth to establish the
