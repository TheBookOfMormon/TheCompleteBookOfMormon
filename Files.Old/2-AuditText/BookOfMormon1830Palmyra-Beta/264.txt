rest of the Lord their God. And now, my brethren, I wouly
that ye should humble yourselves before God, and bring fori
fruit mete for repentance, that ye may also enter into that rest,
yea, humble yoursclvas even as the people in the days of Mg,
chizedek, who was also a Iligh Priest after. this same
which 1 bave spoken, who also took upon him the High Prieg
hood forever. And it was this same Melchizedek te whom
Abraham paid tithes; yea, even our futher Abraham paid tithe
