 

prought them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and to
rejoice in Jesus Christ, thcir Redeemer. And who knaweth
but what they will be the means of bringing many thousands
of them, yea, and elso many thousands of our stiffnecked
brethren, the Nephites, which are now hardening their hearts
in sin and imiquities, to the knowledge of their Redeemer ?—
Now these mysteries are noi yet fully made known unto me;
therefore I shall forbear. And it may suffice, if L only say,
ihey are preserved for awise purpose, which purpose is known
uto God: for he doth counsel in wisdom over all his works,
and his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round,
Oremember, remember, my son Helaman, how strict are the
commandments of God. And he saith, If ye will keep my
coomandments, ye shall prosper in the land; but if ye keep
uot his commandments, ye shull be cut off from his presence.
And now remember, my son, that God hath entrusted you
wilh these things, which are sacred, which he hath kept sa-
eed, and also which he will keep and prescrve for a wise
purpose in him, that he may shew forth his power unto future
gencrations,

And now behold, I tell you by the spirit of prophecy, that
if ye transgress the commandments of God, behold, these
things which are sacred, shall be taken away from you by the
power of God, and ye shall be delivered up unto satan, that he
may sift you as chail' before the wind ; but if ye keep the com-
mandments of God, and do with these things which are saered,
according to that which the Lord doth command you, (for you
mnust appeal unio tie Lord for all things whatsoever ye must
do with them,) behold, no power of earth or hell can take
them from you, for Cod is powerful to the fulfilling of all his
Words: for he will fulfil all his promises which he shall make
tato you, for he hath fulfilled his promise which he hath made
unto our fathers. For he promised unto them that he would
Tesetve these things for a wise purpose in him, that he might
shew forth his power unto future generations.

And now behold, one purpose hath he fulfilled, even to the
'éstoraiion of many thousands of the Lamanites to the knowl-
edge of the truth; and he hath shewn forth his power in them,
and he will also still shew forth his power in them, unto future
Seherations ; therefore they shall he preserved; therefore J
Command you, my son Helaman, that ye be diligent in fulfil-
Sng all my words, and that ye he diligent in keeping the com-
Mandments of God, as they are written.
