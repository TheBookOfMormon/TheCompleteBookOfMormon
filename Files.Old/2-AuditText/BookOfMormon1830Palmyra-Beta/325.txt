men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold, the day of this life
js the day for men to perform their labors. And now as Lsaid
ato you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore
[beseech of you, that ye do not proérasiinate the day of your
yepentance until the end; for after this ay of life, which is
given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve
our time while in this life, then cometh the ght of darkness,
wherein there can be no labor performed. Ye cannot say,
wien ye are brought to that awful crisis, that 1 will repent,
dat Iwill return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for
that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time
that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to
possess your body in that eternal world. For behold, if ye
have procrastinated the day of your repentance, evén until
death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the
Devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore the spirit of the
| Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and
the Devil hath all power over you: and this is the final state
athe wicked. And this I know, because the Lord hath said,
hedwelleth not in unholy temples, but in the hearts of the
ngiteous doth he dwell; yea, and he hath also said, that the
tgltcous should sit down in his kingdom, to go no more out;
bat their garments should be made white, through the blood
othe Lamb.

And now my beloved brethren, I desire that ye should re-
member these things, and that ye should work out your salya-
tion with fear before God, and that ye should no more deny
te coming of Christ: that ye contend no more against the
Holy Ghost, but that ye receive it, and take upon yon the
mame of Christ; that ye humble yourselves even to the dust,
td worship God in whatsoever place ye may be in, in spirit
and in au. and that ye live in thanksgiving daily, for the
Many mercies and blessings which he doth bestow upon you;
Yel, and T also exhort you, my brethren, that ye be watchful
into prayer continually, that ye uray not be Jed away by the
lmpiation of the Dovil, that he may not overpower you, that
femay not become his subjects ot the last day: for behold, he
Rwardeth you no good thing. And now my beloved breth-
Ma exhort you 10 have putience, and that ye bear
