provisions were not any more than sufficient for our own peo-

ple, notwithstanding that which we had taken from the La.
manites. « now, in those critical circumstances, it became
a very serious matter to determine concerning these prisoners
“of war; ueverthcless, we did resolve to send them down to
the land of Zarahemla; therefore we selected a part of our
men, and gaye them charge over our prisoners, to go down to
the land of Zarahemla.

But it came to pass that on the morrow, they did return.—
And now behold, we did not inquire of them concerning the
prisoners; for behold, the Lamanites were upon us, and they
returned in season to save us from falling into their hands.—
For behold, Ammon had sent to their support a new supply of
provisions, and also a numerous army of men,

And it came fo pass that those men which we sent with the
prisoners, did arrive in season to check them, as they were
about to overpower ns. But behold, my little band of tro
thousand and sixty, fought most desperately ; yea, they were
firm before the Lamanites, and did administer death unto all
those who opposed them ; and as the remainder of our anny
were about to give way before the Lamanites, behold, those
two thousand and sixty were firm and undaunted; yea, and

_ they did obey and observe to perform every word of command

with exactness; yea, and eyen according to their faith, it was
done unto them; and I did remember the words which they
said unto me that their mothers had taught them. And now
behold, it was thesc, my sons, and those men which had been
selected to convey the prisoners, to whom we owe this great
victory; for it was they who did beat the Lamanites; there-
fore they were driven back to the eity of Manti. And we re-
tained our city Cumeni, and were not all destroyed by the
sword ; nevertheless, we had suffered great loss.

And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had fled, Tim-
mediately gave orders that my men which had been wounded,
should be taken from among the dead, and caused that their
wounds should be dressed, And it came to pass that there
were two hundred, out of my two thousand and sixty, which
had fainted because of the loss of blood ; nevertheless, accor-
ding to the goodness of God, and to our great astonishment,
and also the foes of our whole army, there was not one soul
of them which did perish; yea, and neither was there one
soul among them which had not reecived many wounds. And
now, their preservation was astonishing to our whole arniys
