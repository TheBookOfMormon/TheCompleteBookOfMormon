God daily, that they might not enter into temptation; yea, in
ine, they did pervert the ways of the Lord in very many in-
ances; thereforc, for this cause, Alma and his brethren went
jato the land, to preach the word unto them.

Now when they had come into the land, behold, to their as-
jishment, they found that the Zoramites had built syna-
gogues, and that they did gather themselves together on one
day of the week, which day they did call the day of the Lord;
md they did worship after a manner which Alma and bis breth-
ren had never beheld ; for they had a place built up in the cen-
ire of their synagogue, a place of standmg, which was high
above the head; and the top thereof would only admit oue
person. Therefore, whosoever desired to worship, must go

their hearts to wander far from thee, our God. And again:
Wethank thee, O God, that we are a chosen and a holy peo-
ple. Amen.

Now it came to pass that after Alma and his brethren, and
lis sons, had heard these prayers, they were astonished be-
youd all measure. For behold, every man did go forth and
- ofier up the same prayers. Now the place was called by them
Rameumptom, which being interpreted, is the Ioly Stand.—
Yow from this stand, they did offer up, every man, the self-
