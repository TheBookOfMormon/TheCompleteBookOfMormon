Jaman had had, in obtaining those lands which were lost; yu,
and he did make it known unto all his people in all the ig
round about in that part where he was, that they might rejoig
also.

And it came to pass that he immediately sent an epistle
Pahoran, desiring that he should cause men to he gatheredig
gether, to strengthen Helaman, or the armies of Helaman, i
somuch that he might with ease maintain that part of the linj
which he had been so miraculously prospered in retaining—
And it came to pass when Moroni had sent this epistle tot,
land of Zarahemla, he began again to lay a plan, that he migy
obtain the remainder of those possessions and cities which ty
Lamanites had taken from them.

And it came to pass that while Moroni was thus makig
preparations to go against the Lamanites to battle, behold,
people of Nephiha!: which were gathered together from the cir
of Moroni, and the city of Lehi, and the city of Moriantn,
were attacked by the Lamanites ; yea, even those which lal
been compelled to flee from the land of Manti, and from tk
land round abeut, had come over and joined the Lamanitesi
this part of the land; and thus being exceeding numerous, ya
~and receiving strength from day to day, by the command ¢
Ammoron, they came forth against the people of Nephibih
and they did begin to slay them with an exeeeding gui
slaughter. And their armies were so numerous, that the re
mainder of the people of Nephihah were obliged to flee befor
them; and they came-even and joined the army of Moroni—
And now as Moroni ‘had supposed that there should bema
sent to the city of Nephihah, to the assistance of the people
to maintain that city, and knowing that it was easier to ke
the city from falling into the hands of the Lamanites, than b
retake it from them, he supposed’ that they would eaill
maintain that city; therefore he retained all his force to mit
tain those places whieh he had recovered.

And now when Moroni saw that the city of Nephihah w#
lost, hé was exceeding sorrowful, and began to doubt, becal®
of the wickedness of the people, whether they should not fl
into the hands of their brethren, Now this was the case will
all his Chief Captaiis. They doubted and marvelled als.
because of the wickedness of the people ; and this because
the success of the Lamanites over them. And it came fo pe
that Moroni was angry with the government, because of the
indifference concerning the freedom of their country.
