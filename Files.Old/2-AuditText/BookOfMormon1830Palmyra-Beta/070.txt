CHAPTER IL

Ax now I speak unto you, Joseph, my last born. Thou
wast Lorn in the wilderness of mine altiictions; yea, in the days
of aly greatest sorrow, did thy unvther bear thee, And mo
the Lord consecrate aJso unto thee this laud, which is a most
precious land for thine inheritance and the inheritance of thy
seed with thy brethren, for thy security forever, if itso be that ye.
shall keep the commandments of the Loly One of Israel. Ant
now, Joseph, my last born, whom | have brought out of the wik
derness of mine afflictions, may the Lord bless thee forever, for
thy seed shall not utterly be destroyed, For behold, thou art the

be of great worth unto them, even to the bringing of them
the Knowledge of the covenants whic I have made with thy!
fathers. And I will give unto him a commandment, that he
shail do none other work, save the work which I shall com
mand him. And I will meke him great in mine eyes: for ke
