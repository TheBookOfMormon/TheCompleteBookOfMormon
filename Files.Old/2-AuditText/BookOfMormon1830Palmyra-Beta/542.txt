this, and endure to the end, ye will in no wise be cast out.
Behold, I speak unto you as though f spake from the dead;
for I know that ye shall hear my words. Condemn me ng
because of mine imperfection ; neither my father, because gf
his imperfection ; neither them which have written before him,

all the saints which haye dwelt in the land. And may tle
Lord Jesus Christ grant that their prayers may be answered
according t@ their faith; and may God the Father remember
the covenant which he hath made with the house of Israd;
and may heâ€™ bless them forever, through faith on the named!
Jesus Christ. Amen.
