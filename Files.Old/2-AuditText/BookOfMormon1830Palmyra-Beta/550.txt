Jared to go down out of the mount from the presence of the
Lord, and write the things-which he had seen: and they were
forbidden to come unto the children of men, until after that
he should be lifted up upon.the cross: and for this cause did
king Benjamin keep them, that they should not come unto the
world until after Christ should shew himself unto his people.
â€˜And after that Christ truly had shewed himself unto his peo-
ple, he commanded that they should be made manifest, And
now, after- that, they have all dwindled in unbelief, and there is
none, save it be the Lamanites, and they have rejected the
Gospel of Christ; therefore | am commanded that I should
hide them up again in the earth. Behold, I have written upon
these plates the very things, which the brother of Jared saw;
and there never'wes greater things made manifest, than that
which was made manifest unto the brother of Jared ; where-
fore, the Lord hath commanded me to write them; and | have
wrote them. And he commanded me that I should scal them
up; and he also hath commanded that I should seal up the in-
terpretation thereof; wherefore I have sealed up the interpre-
ters, according to the commandment of the Lord. For the
Lord saith unto me, They shall not go forth unto the Gentiles

come clean before the Lord; and in that day that they shall
exercise faith in me, saith the Lord, even as the brother of Ja-

manifest unto them the things which the brother of Jared saw,
even to the unfolding unto them all my revelations, saith Je

the earth, and ell things that im them is. And he that wil
contend against the word of the Lord, let him be accursed;
and he that shall deny these things, let him be accursed : for
wnto them will I shew no. greater things, saith Jesus Chnist, for
Yam he which speaketh; and at my command the heavens
are opened and are shut; and at my word, the earth shall
shake; and at my command, the inhabitants thereof shal! pass
away, even so as by fire; and he that believeth not my words,
helieveth not my disciples; and ifit so be that I do not speak,
judge ye: for ye shall know that itis I that speaketh, at the
last day. But he that believeth these things which I have
spoken, him will I visit with the manifestations of my spit
and he shall know and bear record. For because of my sp
