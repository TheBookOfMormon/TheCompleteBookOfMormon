according to his strength ; and they did impart of their ste!
stance every man accordmy to that which be liad, to the Poor,
and the needy, and the sick, and the aillicted; and they dig
not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and comely : and
thus they did establish the aflairs of the Church: and thy
they began to have continual peace again, notwithstanding gj
dhier persey And now because of the steadiness of the
Cuurch, ni an to be exceeding rich; having abundance
of all thing aisoever they stood in need; an abundanes of
flow herds, and fathags of every kind, and also abup
grain, and of gold, and of silver, and of preciogs
things; and abundance of silk and fine twined linen, and aij
mauner of good homely oth. And thus in their prosperoyg
circumstances they did voi send away any which was naked,
or that was hungry, or that was athirst, or that was sick, @
that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hears
upon riches ; taerefore they were liberal to all, both old and
young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether orf
of the Church or in the Church, haying no respects to persons
as to these who stood in need; and thus they did prosper aud
become far more wealthy, than those who did not belong to
their Church, _ Por those who did not belong to their Chureh,
did indulge themselves in sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness
and in bablings, and in envyings and strife; wearing costly ap
parel ; being hitted up in the pride of ther own eyes; lying
thieving, robbing, commiting whoredoms, and murdering, and
ali manner of wickedness; nevertheless, the law was put in
force upon all those who did transgress it, inasmuch as #
were possible.

them, cver¥oman sufleriug according to that which he ha
done, they became more still, and durst not commit any wick
edness, if it were known; therefore, there was much peace
among the people of Nephi, until the fifth year of the reign ob

fth year of their reign, there began to be a contention among
the people, for a certain man, bemg called Amlici; he being &
very cunning man, yea, a wise man, as to the wisdom of the

world; he being after ihe order ofthe man that slew Gideon
by the sword, who was executed according to the Jaw. | Now”
this Amlici had, by his cumming, drawn away much people af
‘er him; even so much that they begen to be yery poweiful
and they began to endeavor to establish Atlici to be a king”
