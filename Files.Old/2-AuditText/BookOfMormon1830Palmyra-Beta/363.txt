had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, be-

hold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever ;
yea, the Devil would never have no power over the hearts of
jhe children of men. Behold, he was aman like unto Ammon,
the son of Mosiah, yea, and even the other sons of Mosiah ;
yea, and also Alma and his sons: for they were all men of
God. Now bebold, Helaman and his brethren were no less
serviceable unto the people, than was Moroni; for they did
preach the word of God, and they did baptize unto repentance,
a}} men whosoever would hearken unto their words. And
thus they went forth, and the people did humble themselves
because of their words, insomuch that they were highly favor-
ed of the Lord; and thus they were free from wars and con-
fentions among themselves; yea, even for the space of four
years. Butas Ihave said in the latter end of the nineteenth ;
yea, notwillstanding their peace amongst themselves, they
were compelled reluctantly to contend with their brethren, the
Lamanites; yea, and im fine, their wars neyer did cease for

nevertheless, they could not suffer to lay down their lives, that â€”
their wives and their children should be massacred by the bar-

had dissented from their church, and had left them, and had
gone to destroy them, by joining the Lamanites; yea, they
could not bear that their brethren should rejoice over the blood
of the Nephites, so long as there were any who should keep
the commandments of God: for the promise of the Lord were,
If they should keep his commandments, they should prosper
in the land. ;

_ And now it came to pass, in the eleventhmonth of the nine-
teenth year, on the tenth day of the month, the armies of the
Lamanites were seen approaching towards the land of Ammo-
nihah. And behold, the city had been re-built, and Moroni
had stationed an army by the borders of the city, and they
had cast up dirt round about, to shield them from the arrows
and the stones of the Lamanites; for behold, they fought
with stones, and with arrows. Behold, I said that the city of
Ammonihah had-been re-built, .I say unto you, yea, that it
