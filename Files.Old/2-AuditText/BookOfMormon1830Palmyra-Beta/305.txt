is land Jershon is the land which we will give unto our breth-
yn, for an inheritance. And behold, we will sci our armics
jetween the land Jershon and the land Nephi, that-we may
fect our brethren in the land Jershon; and this we do for
our brethren, on account of their fear to take up arms against
her brethren, lest they should commit sin ;and this their great
jareame, because of their sore repentance which they had,
maccount of their many murders, and thuir awful wickedness.
$od now behold, this will we do unto onr brethren, that they
my mherit the land Jershon; and we will guard tiem from
her enemies with our armics, on conditions that they will give
