deapised the words of plainness, and killed the Prophets, and
sought for things that they could not understand. Wherefore,
because of their blindness, which blindness came by looking
beyond the mark, they must needs fall: for God hath taken
away his plainness from them, and delivered unto them many
things which they cannot understand; because they desired it.
And because they desired it, God hath donc it, that they may
stumble.

And now I, Jacob, am led on by the spirit unto prophesying:
for I perceive by the workings of the spirit which is in me,
that by the stumbling of the Jews, they will reject the stone
upen which they might build, and have safe foundation. But
behold, according to the Scriptures, this stone shall become
the great, and the last, and the only sure foundation, upon
which the Jews can build. And now, my beloved, how is it

many days, it began to put forth somewhat a ithe, young and
tender branches; but behold, the main top thereof began to
perish. And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard
saw it, and he sayeth unto his servant, It grieveth me that I
should lose this tree; wherefore, go and pluck the branches
from a wild olive tree, and bring them hither unto me; and we
