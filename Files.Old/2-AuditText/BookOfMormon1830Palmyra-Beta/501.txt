they have scattered my people, then shall ye which are a rem-
nant of the house of Jacob, go forth among them; and ye shall
be in the midst of them, which shall be many; and ye shall be
among them, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, and as
a young lion among the flocks of shecp, who, if he goeth
through, both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none
can deliver. Thy hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversa-
nes, and all thine enemies shall be cut off And I will gather
wy people together, as a man gathereth his sheaves into the
floor: for I will make my people with whom the Father hath
eovenanted, yea, I will make thy horn iron, and I will make
thy hoofs brass. And thou shalt beat in pieces many people ;
and | will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their sub-
stance unto the Lord of the whole earth. And behold, T am
he which doeth it. And it shall come to pass, saith the Fa-
ther, That the sword of my justice shalt hang over them at
that day; and except they repent, it shall fall upon them, saith
the Father, yea, even upon all the nations of the Gentilcs.—
And it shall come to pass that I will establish my people, O
house of Isracl, And behold, this people will I establish in
this land, unto the fulfilling of the covenant which I made with
your Father Jacob; and it shall be a new Jerusalem. And
the powers of heaven shal] be in the midst of this people; yea,
even 1 will be in the midst of you. Behold, Iam he of whom
Moses spake, saying: A prophet shall the Lord your God
tulse up unto you of your brethren, like untome: him shall ye
hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it
shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that
prophet, shall be cut off from among the people. Verily, I
say unto you, Yea; and all the prophets from Samuel, and
those that follow afier, as many as have spoken, have testified
ofme. And behold, ye are the children of the prophets; and
ye are of the house of Isracl; and ye are of the covenant which
the Father made with your fathers, saying: Unto Abraham,
aud in thy seed, shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed:
the Father having raised me wp unto you first, and sent me to
Hess you, in turning away every on@ of you from his iniqui-
hes; and this because ye are the children of the covenant,—
And after that ye were blessed, then fulfilleth the Father the
venani which he made with Abraham, saying: In thy seed
shall all the kindveds of the earth be blessed, unto the pouring
out of the Holy Ghost through me upon the Gentiles, which
ee upon the Gentiles, shall make them mighty above all,
