many of the people which were exceeding angry, because of
those which testified of’ these things; and those which were
angry, were chiefly the Chief Judges, and they which had been
High Priests, and lawyers; yca, all they which were lawyers,
were angry with those which testified of these things. Now
there was no lawyer, nor Judge, nor High Priest, that could
have power to condemn any one to death, save their condem-
nation was signed by the governor of the land, Now there
were many of those which testified of the things pertaining to
Christ, which testified boldly, which were taken and put to
death secretly, by the Judges, that the knowledge of their
death came not unto the governor of the land, until after their
death. Now behold, this was contrary to the laws of the land,

defiance the law and the rights of their country; and they did
Sovenant, one with another, to destroy the governor, and to es-
tiblish a king over the land, that the land should no more be
aliberty, but should be subject unto kings. Now behold, I
Will shew: unto you that they did nof establish a king over the
lind; but in this same year, yea, the thirtieth year, they did
