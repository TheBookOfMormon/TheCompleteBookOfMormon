~ Bexoup, now it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites
Sait a proclamation among all his people, that they should not
lay their hands on Aiomon, or Aaron, or Omner, or Tlimni,

wt neithet of their brethren which should go forth preaching
the word of God, in whatsoever place they should be,, in any
part of their land ; yea, he sent a decree among them, that they
should not lay their hands on them to bind them, or to cast
theminto prison ; neither should they spit upoa them, nor smite
ihein, nor cast them out of their synagogues, nor scourge them 5
