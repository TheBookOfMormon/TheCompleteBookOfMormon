 

in biz stead, and also of destroying the people of Anti-Nepbi-
Lehi out of the land. And it came to pass that when the peo-

{e saw that they were coming against them, they went out to
meet them, and prostrated themselves before them to the
earth, and began to call on the name of the Lord; and thus
they were in this attitude, when the Lamanites began to fall
upon them, and began to slay them with the sword; and thus,
without meeting any resisfance, they did slay a thousand and
fve of them; and we know that they are blessed, for they
have gone to dwell with their God. Now when the Laman-
iles saw that their brethren would not flee from the sword,
neither would they turn aside to the right hand or to the left,
but that they would lay down and perish, and praised God
even in the very act of péerishing under the sword; now when
the Lamanites saw this, they did forbear from slaying them ;
amd there were many whose hearis had swollen in them for
those of their brethren who had fallen under the sword, for
they repented of the things which they had done.

And it came to pass that they threw down their weapons of
war, and they would not take them again, for they were stung
fr the murders which they had committed; and they came
down even as their brethren, relying upon the mercies of those
those arms were lifted to slay them.

And it came to pass that the people of God were joined
hat dey by more than the number which had been slain; and
those which had been slain, were righteous people; there-
fore we have no reason to doubt but what they are saved.—
And there was not a wicked man slain among them ; but there
Were more than a thousand brought to the knowledge of the
‘imith; thus we see that the Lord worketh in many ways to
the salvation of his people. Now the greatest number of those
ofthe Lamanites which slew so many of their brethren, were
Amelekites and Amulonites, the greatest number of whom
Were after the order of the Nehors. Now among those which
dined the people of the Lord, there were none which were
Amalekites or Amulonites, or which were of the order of Ne-

1, but they were actual descendants of Laman and Lemuel ;
md thus we can plainly discern, that afler a people has been
ones enlightened by the spirit of God, and hath had great’

oWledge of things pertaining to righteousness, and then have
allen eway into sin and transgression, they become more har-

lened, and thus their estate becometh worse than as though
Hey had never known these things.
