God. And blessed are all they which are persecuted, for my
namesake, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven. And bles
sed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute, and
shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake,
for ye shall have great joy and be execeding glad, for grea
shall be your reward in Heaven: for so persecuted they
the prophets which were before you. Verily, verily 1 say unio
you, I give unto you to be the salt of the earth ; but if the sd
shall lose its savor, wherewith shall the earth besalted? The
salt shall be thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out
and to be trodden under footof men. Verily, verily I say wo
you, Igive unto you to be the light of this people. A til
that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Behold, do men lights
candle and put it under a bushel? Nay, but on a candle

let your light so shine belore this people, that they may xe
