jaye been spoken by the holy prophets, shall all be fulfilled ; and
ye need not say that the Lord delays his coming unto the chil-
dren of Israel; and ye need not imagine in your hearts, that
the words which have becn spoken are vain, for behold, the
Lord will remember his covenant which he hath made unto
his people of the house of Israel. And when ye shall see
these sayings coming forth among you, then ye need not any
longer spun at the doings of the Lord, for the sword of his .
justice is in his right hand, and behold at that day, if ye shall
spurn at his doings, he will cause it that it shall soon overtake

yea, wo unto him that shall deny the Christ and his works;
yea, wo unto him that shall deny the revelations of the Lord,
and that shall say, the Lord no longer worketh by revelation,
or by prophecy, or by gifis, or by tongues, or by healings, or
bythe power of the Holy Ghost; yea, and wo unto him that
sell say at that day, that there can be no miracle wrought by
Jesus Christ, for to get gain; for he that doeth this, shall be-

Lord remembereth his covenant unto them, and he willdo unto
them according to that which he hath sworn; therefore ye
need not suppose that ye can turn the right hand of the Lord
unto the left, that he may not execute judgement unto the ful-
ad of the covenant which he hath made unto the house of
israel.
