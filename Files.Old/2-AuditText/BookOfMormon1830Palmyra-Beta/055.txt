very God of Israel, do men trample under their feet; I say,
trample under their feet; but T would speak in other words:
They do set him at nought, and hearken not to the voice of his
counsels; and behold, he cometh according to the words of
the angel, in six hundred years from the time my father left
Jerusalem. And the world, because of their iniquity, shall
judge him to bea thing of nought; wherefore, they scourge him,
and he suffereth it; and they smite him, | and he suffereth at.
Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his lo-
ying kindness and his long suffering towards the children of
men. And the God of our fathers, which were led out of
Exypt, out of bondage, and also were preserved in the wilder-
ness by him; yea, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob, yieldeth himself according to the words of the
angel, as a man, into the hands of wicked men, to be lifted up
according to Ure words of Zenock, and to be crucified, aceor-
ding to the words of Neum, and to be buried in a sepulchre,
and according to the words of Zenos, which he spake, concer-
ning the three days of darkness, which should be a sign given
of his death, unto them who should inhabit the isles of the sea;
more especially given unto them which are of the House of Is
rael. For-thus spake the Prophet: The Lord God surely
shail visit all the House of Israel at that day: some with his
voice, because of their righteousness, unto their great joy and
salvation; and others, with the thunderings and the lightuings
of his power, by tempest, by fire, and by smoke, and vapour
of darkness, and by the opening of the earth, and by moun-
tains which shall be carvied up; and all these things must
surely come, saith the Propket Zenos. And the rocks of the.
carth must rend; and because of the groanings of the earth,
many of the Kings of the isles of the sea shall be wrought up-
on by the spirit of God, to exclaim, The God of nature suffers.
And as for they which are at Jerusalem, saith the prophet, shall
be scourged by all people, saith the prophet, because they
erucily the God of Israel, and turned their hearts aside, rejec-
ting signs, and wonders, and power and glory of the God of
Israel; and because they turned their hearts aside, saith the
prophet, and have despised the Holy one of Israel, they shall
wander in the flesh, and perish, and become a hiss and a by-
word, and be hated among all nations ; nevertheless, when
that day cometh, saith the prophet, that they no more turn
aside their hearts against the Holy one of Isracl, then will he
remember the covenants which he made to their fathers ; yea;!
