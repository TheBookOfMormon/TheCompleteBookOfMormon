unto us in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may

thou canst do this. We know that thouart able to shew for}

had said these words, behold, the Lord stretched forth his
band and touched the stones, oneâ€™ by one, with his finger; an]
the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared,
and he saw the finger of the Lord; and it was as the fingerof
aman, like unto flesh and blood; and the brother of Jured
fell down before the Lord, for he was struck with fear. And
the Lord saw that the brother of Jared had fallen to the earth;
