which are most bitter; and in them ye shell grafi, according
to that which I have said. And we will nourish again the
irees of the vineyard, and we will trim np the branches there~
of; and we will pluck from the trees those branches which
are ripened, that must peris , and cast them into: the tire.—
And this f do, that perhaps the roots thercof :nay take strength,
because of their goodness; and because of d e change of tie
branches, that the goad may overeome the evil; and because
that I have preserved the natural branches, and the roots
thereof; and that | have grafted intbe natural branches again,
jnto their mother tree; and have preserved the roots of their
mother tree, that perhaps the trees of my vineyard may bring
forth again good fruit; and that T may bave joy again in the
fruit of my vineyard; and perhaps that ! may rejoice excee-
dingly, that Ihave prescryed the roots and the branches of the
first fruit; wherefore, go to, and call servants, that we may
jabor diligently with our wi in the vmeyard, that we may
prepare the way, that l may bring forth again the natural frait,
which natural fruit is good, and the most precious above all
other fruit. Wherefore, let us go to, and labor with our
mights, this last time: for behold, the end draweth nigh; and
this is for the last time that Ishall prune my vineyard. Graft
iu the branches: begin at the last, that they may be first, and
that the frst may be last, and dig about the trees, both old and
young, the first and the last, and the last and the first, that all
may be nourished once again for the Jast time. W herefere,
dig about them, and prune them, and dung them once more,
for the last time: for the end draweth nigh. And if it so be
that these last grafts shall grow,-and bring forth the natural
fruit, then shell ye prepare the way for them, that they may
grow; end as they begin to grow, ye shall clear away the
branches which bring forth bitter fruit, according to the strength
of the good and the size thereof; and ye shall not clear away
the bad thereof, all at once, lest the roots thereof should be too
strong for the graft, and the graft thereof shall perish, and 1
lase the trees of my vineyard. For it grieveih me that [ should
lise the trees of my vineyard; wherefore, ye shall clear away
the bad, according as the good shall grow, that the reot and
the top may be equal in strength, until the good shall overcome
the bad, and the bad be hewn down and cast into the fire, that
they cumber not the ground of my vineyard; and thus will £
sweep away the bad out of my vineyard. And the branches,
of the natural tree, will I graft in again, into the natural tree;
