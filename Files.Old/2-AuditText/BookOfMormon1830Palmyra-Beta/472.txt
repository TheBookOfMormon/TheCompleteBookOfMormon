every man according to his family, and his kindred and friends;
and thus they did destroy the government of the land. And
every tribe did appoint a Chief, or a leader over them ; and
thus they became tribes, and leaders of tribes. Now behold,
there was no man among them, save he lad much family and
many kindreds and friends; therefore. their tribes became ex-
ceeding great. Now all this was done, and there was no wars
as yet among them; and all this iniquity had come upon the
people, because they did yicld themselves unto the power of
satan; and the regulations of the goverment was destroyed,
