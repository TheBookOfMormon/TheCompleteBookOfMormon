again, and we did maintain the city. And there were also
other cities which were maintained by the Nephites, which
strong holds did cut them off that they could not get into the
country which lay before us to destroy the inhabitants of our
land, But it came to pass that whatsoever lands we had pas-
sed by, and the inhabitants thercof were not gathered in, were -
destroyed by the Lamanites, and their towns, and villages, and
cities were burned with fire ; and thus the three hundred and
seventy and nine years passed away.

And it came to pass that in the three hundred and eightieth
year, the Lamanites did come again against us to battle, and
we did stand against them boldly ; but it was alt in vain, for
so great were their numbers that they did tread the people of
ihe Nephites under their feet. And it came to pass that we
did again take to flight, and they whose flight were swifter than
the Lamanites did escape, and they whose flight did not ex--
ceed the Lamanites, were swept down and destroyed. And
now behold, I, Mormon, do not desire to harrow up the souls
of men in casting before them such an awful scene of blood
and carnage as was laid before mine eyes, but 1, knowing that
these things must surely be made knowa, and that all things
which are hid must be revealed upon the house tops, and al-

Lord hath said should scaticr this people, and this people
should be counted as nought among them, therefore I write a
small abridgement, daring not to give a full account of the
things which I have seen, because of the commandment which
Thave received, and also that ye might not have too great sor-
row because of the wickedness of this people. And now be-
hold, this 1 speak unto their seed, and also to the Gentiles,
which hath care for the house of Isracl, that realize and know
fiom whence their blessings come: For I know that such
will sorrow for the calamity of the house of Israel; yea, they
will sorrow for the destruction of this people; they will sor-
row that this people had not repented, that they might have
been clasped in the arms of Jesus. Now these things are
Written unto the remnant of the house of Jacob; and they are
Written after this manner, because it is known â€˜of God that
Wickedness will not bring them forth unto them; and they
are to be hid up unto the Lord, that they may come forth in
his own due time. And this is the commandment which F
have received; and behold they shall come forth according te
