ness, and all their sufferings with hunger and thirst, and their
travel, &c.; and be also rehearsed unto them concerning the
rebellions of Laman and Lemucl, and the sons of Ishmael,
yea, all their rebellions did he relate unto them; and he ex-
pounded unto them all the records and Scriptures, from the
time that Lehi left Jerusalem, down to the present iime ; but
this is not all, for he expounded unto them the plan of re-
demption, which was prepared from the foundation of the
world; and he also made known unto them concerning the
coming of Christ; and all the works of the Lord did he make
