BOOK OF HELAMAN, 451

as a Christ shall come; if so, and he be the Son of God, the
Father of Heaven and of earth, as it hath been spoken, why
will he not shew himself unto us, as well as unto they which
shall be at Jerusalem? Yea, why will he not shew himself in
this land, as well as in the land of Jerusalem? But behold,
we know that this is a wicked tradition, which has been han-
ded down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we should
believe in some great and marvellous thing which. should come
fo pass, but not among us, but in a land which is far distant,
aland which we know not; therefore they can keep us in ig-
norance, for we cannot witness with our own eyes that they
are true. And they will, by the cunning and the mysterious
arts of the evil one, work some great mystery, which we cannot
understand, which will kecp us down to be servants to their
words, and also servants unto them, for we depend upon them
for to teach us the word; and thus will they keep us in igno-
rance,.if we will yicld ourselves unto them all the days of our
lives, And many more things did the people imagine up in
their hearts, which were foolish and vain; and they were much
disturbed, for satan did stir them up to do iniquity continually ;
yea, he did go about. spreading rumors and contentions upon
all the face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of
the people against that which was good, and against that which
should come ; and notwithstanding the signs and the wonders
which was wrought among the people of the Lord, and the
many miracles which they did, satan did get great hold upon
the hearts of the people, upon all the face of the land. And
thus ended the ninetieth year of the reign of the Judges over
the people of Nephi. And thus ended the book of Helaman,
tccording to the record of Telaman and his sons.
