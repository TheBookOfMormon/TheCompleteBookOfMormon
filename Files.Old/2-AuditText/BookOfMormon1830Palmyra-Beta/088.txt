For behold, the promises which we have obtained, are promi.
ses unto us according to the flesh; wherefore, as it hath been
shown unto me that many of our children shall perish in the
flesh, because of unbelief, nevertheless, God will be mereifi
unto many; and our children shall be restored, that they may
come to that which will give them the true knowledge of ther
Redeemer. Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs he
expedient that Christ, (for in the last night the Angel spake
vato me that this should be his name,) should come among
the Jews, among they which are the more wicked part of the
world; and they shall crucify him: For thus it behooveth
our God; and there is none other nation on carth that would
crucify their God, For should the mighty miracles be wrought
among other nations, they would repent, and know that he be
theiriod; but because of priest-crafts and iniquities, theyat
Jerusalem will stiffen their necks against him, that he be era

famines, pestilences, and bloodsheds, shall come upon them;

become unrsing mothers; wherefore, the promises of the Lord
are great unto the Gentiles: for he hath spoken it, and who cau
dispute. But behold, This land, saith God, shall be a land
of thine inheritance ; and the Gentiles shall be blessed upon
the land. And this land shall be a Jand of liberty unto the
Goatiles; and there shall be no kings upon the land, whieh
shall raise up unto the Gentiles, And I will fortify this Jand
against all other nations; and he that fighleth against Zion,
shall perish, saith God: for he that raiseth up a king agains!
me, shall perish. For 1 the Lord, the King of Heaven, will be
their king; and I will be a light unto them forever, that hear
my words. Wherefore, for this cause, that my covenants may
be fulfilled, which Ihave made unto the children of men, that
