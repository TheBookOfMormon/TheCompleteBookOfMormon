ding of blood ; for they had not taken any cities, save they had
lost much blood. And now ‘Teancum saw that the Lamanites
were determined to maintain those cities which they had taken,
and those parts of the land which they had obtained possession
of; and also sceing the enormity of their number, Teancum
thought it was not expedient that he should attempt to attack
them in their forts; but he kept his men round about, as if
making preparations for war; yea, and truly he was preparing
to defend himself against them, by casting up walls round
about, and preparing places of resort.

And it came to pass that he kept thus preparing for war,
until Moroni had sent a large number of men to strengthen his
amy; and Moroni also sent orders unto him, that he should
retain all the prisoners which fell into his hands; for as the
Lamauites had taken many prisoners, that he should retain all
the prisoners of the Lamanites, as a ransom for those which
the Lamanites had taken. And_he also sent orders unto him, .

And he also said unto him, Twould come unto‘you, but behold,
the Lamanites are upon us in the borders of the land by the
West Sca; and block I go against them, therefore I cannot
come unto you.

Now the king (Ammoron,) had departed out of the land of
Zsxahomla, and had made known unto the queen concerning
the death of his brother, and had gathered together a large
tumber of men, and had marched forth against the Nephites,
on the borders by the West Sea; and thus he was endeavoring
toharrass the Nephites, and to draw away a part of their for-
ets to that part of the land, while he had commanded those
which he had left to possess the cities which he had taken,
that they should also harrass the Nepbites on the borders by
the East Sea; and should take possession of their lands as
