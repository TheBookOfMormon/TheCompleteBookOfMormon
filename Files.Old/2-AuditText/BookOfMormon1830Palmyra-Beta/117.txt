the Holy One of Isracl; and they say unio the people, Heai-
ken unto us, and hear ye ourprecept: for behold, there is no
(God to-day, for the Lord and the Redeemer hath done his
work, and he hath given his power unto men. Behold, kear-
ken ye unto my precept: if they shall say there is a miracle ,
wrought, by the hand of the Lord, believe itnot; for this day
he is nota God of miracles: he hath done his work. Yea, and
there shall be many which shall say, eat, drink, and be merry,
for to-morrow we die; and ii shall be well with us. And there
shall also be many which shall say, eat, drink, and be merry;
nevertheless, fear God, he will justify in committing a little sin;
yea, lie alittle, take the advantage of one because of lis words,
dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this» And do

are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and at last we
shall be saved in the Kingdom of God. Yea, and there shai

because of pride, and wickedness, and abominations, and
whoredoms, they have all gone avtezy, save it be a few, which
are the humble followers of Christ; nevertheless, they are

by the precepts of men,

O the wise, and the learned, and the rich, that are puffed
‘up in the pride of their hearts, and all they that preach false
doctrines, and all they that commit whoredoms, and pervert
the right way of the Lord; wo, wo, wo be unio them, saith
the Lord God Almighty, for they shall be thrust down to hell.

Wo mnto them that turn aside the just for a thing of nought, —
and revile against that which is good, and say that it is of ne
