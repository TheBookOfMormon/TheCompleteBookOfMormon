and learn of me; for I doknow that whomsoever shall put his
trust in God, shall be supported in their trials, and their troub.
les, and their afflictions, and shall be lified up at the last day;
and I would not that ye think that I know of myself, not of
the temporal, but of the spiritual; not of the carnal mind, buy
of God, Now behold I say unto you, If] had not been bom
of God, 1 should not have known these things; but God hath,
by the mouth of his holy angel, made these things known uw.
to me, not of any worthiness of myself, for I went about with
the sons of Mosiah, sccking to destroy the church of God;
but behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us by the way—
