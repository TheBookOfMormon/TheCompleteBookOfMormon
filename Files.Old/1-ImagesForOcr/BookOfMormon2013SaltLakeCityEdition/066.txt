of time he cometh to bring salvation
unto men.

4 And thou hast “beheld in thy
youth his glory; wherefore, thou
art blessed even as they unto whom
he shall minister in the flesh; for
the Spirit is the same, yesterday,
today, and forever. And the way is
prepared from the fall of man, and
*salvation is ‘free.

5 And men are instructed suffi-
ciently that they “know good from
evil. And the ‘law is given unto men.
And by the law no flesh is ‘justi-
fied; or, by the law men are cut off.
Yea, by the temporal law they were
cut off; and also, by the spiritual
law they perish from that which
is good, and become miserable
forever.

6 Wherefore, ‘redemption cometh
in and through the "Holy “Messiah;

God; wherefore, they stand in the
presence of him, to be *judged of
him according to the truth and ‘ho-

One hath given, unto the inflicting
of the ‘punishment which is affixed,
which punishment that is affixed

11 For it must needs be, that there
is an “opposition in all things. If not
so, my firstborn in the wilderness,
righteousness could not be brought
