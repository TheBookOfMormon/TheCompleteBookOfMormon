us to this great knowledge, whereby
we do rejoice with such exceedingly
great joy.

5 And we are willing to enter into
a “covenant with our God to do his
will, and to be obedient to his com-
mandments in all things that he
shall command us, all the remainder
of our days, that we may not bring
upon ourselves a *never-ending
torment, as has been spoken by the
“angel, that we may not drink out
of the cup of the wrath of God.

6 And now, these are the words
which king Benjamin desired of
them; and therefore he said unto
them: Ye have spoken the words
that I desired; and the covenant
which ye have made is a righteous
covenant.

7 And now, because of the cov-
enant which ye have made ye shall
be called the “children of Christ,
his sons, and his daughters; for be-
hold, this day he hath spiritually
begotten you; for ye say that your
hearts are changed through faith
on his name; therefore, ye are ‘born
of him and have become his ‘sons
and his daughters.

8 And under this head ye are made
“free, and there is *no other head
whereby ye can be made free. There
is no other ‘name given whereby
salvation cometh; therefore, I would
that ye should ‘take upon you the
name of Christ, all you that have
entered into the covenant with God
that ye should be obedient unto the
end of your lives.

9 And it shall come to pass that
whosoever doeth this shall be found
at the right hand of God, for he

 

shall know the name by which he
is called; for he shall be called by
the name of Christ.

10 And now it shall come to pass,
that whosoever shall not take upon
him the name of Christ must be
called by some “other name; there-
fore, he findeth himself on the “left
hand of God.

11 And I would that ye should re-
member also, that this is the ‘name
that I said I should give unto you
that never should be blotted out,
except it be through transgression;
therefore, take heed that ye do not
transgress, that the name be not
blotted out of your hearts.

121 say unto you, I would that
ye should remember to “retain the
name written always in your hearts,
that ye are not found on the left
hand of God, but that ye hear and
know the voice by which ye shall
be called, and also, the name by
which he shall call you.

13 For how “knoweth a man the
master whom he has not served,
and who is a stranger unto him,
and is far from the thoughts and
intents of his heart?

14 And again, doth a man take an
ass which belongeth to his neigh-
bor, and keep him? I say unto you,
Nay; he will not even suffer that he
shall feed among his flocks, but will
drive him away, and cast him out.
Isay unto you, that even so shall it
be among you if ye know not the
name by which ye are called.

15 Therefore, I would that ye should
be steadfast and immovable, always
abounding in “good works, that
