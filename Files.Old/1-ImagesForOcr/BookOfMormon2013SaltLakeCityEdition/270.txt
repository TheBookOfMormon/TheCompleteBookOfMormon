then will I spare thee; otherwise I
will smite thee to the earth.

25 Now when Ammon had said
these words, the king began to re-
joice because of his life.

26 And when he saw that Ammon
had no desire to destroy him, and
when he also saw the great “love
he had for his son Lamoni, he was
astonished exceedingly, and said:
Because this is all that thou hast
desired, that I would *release thy
brethren, and suffer that my son
Lamoni should retain his kingdom,
behold, I will grant unto you that
my son may retain his kingdom
from this time and forever; and I
will govern him no more—

27 And I will also grant unto thee
that thy brethren may be cast out
of prison, and thou and thy breth-
ren may come unto me, in my king-
dom; for I shall greatly desire to
see thee. For the king was greatly
astonished at the words which he
had spoken, and also at the words
which had been spoken by his son
Lamoni, therefore he was “desirous to
learn them.

28 And it came to pass that Am-
mon and Lamoni proceeded on
their journey towards the land of
Middoni. And Lamoni found favor
in the eyes of the king of the land;
therefore the brethren of Ammon
were brought forth out of prison.

29 And when Ammon did meet
them he was exceedingly sorrowful,
for behold they were naked, and
their skins were worn exceedingly
because of being bound with strong
cords. And they also had “suffered
hunger, thirst, and all kinds of af-
flictions; nevertheless they were
‘patient in all their sufferings.

30 And, as it happened, it was their
lot to have fallen into the hands of
amore hardened and a more “stiff-
necked people; therefore they would
not hearken unto their words, and

 

they had cast them out, and had
smitten them, and had driven them
from house to house, and from
place to place, even until they had
arrived in the land of Middoni; and
there they were taken and cast into
prison, and bound with *strong
cords, and kept in prison for many
days, and were delivered by Lamoni
and Ammon.

Aaron, and Muloki, and their breth-
ren, to the Lamanites.

Comprising chapters 21 through 25.

CHAPTER 21

Aaron teaches the Amalekites about
Christ and His Atonement—Aaron
and his brethren are imprisoned in
Middoni—After their deliverance, they
teach in the synagogues and make many
converts—Lamoni grants religious free-
dom to the people in the land of Ishmael.
About 90-77 B.C.

Now when Ammon and his breth-
ren “separated themselves in the
borders of the land of the Laman-
ites, behold Aaron took his journey
towards the land which was called
by the Lamanites, ’Jerusalem, call-
ing it after the land of their fathers’
nativity; and it was away joining
the borders of Mormon.

2 Now the Lamanites and the
Amalekites and the people of “Amu-
lon had built a great city, which
was called Jerusalem.

3 Now the Lamanites of themselves
were sufficiently hardened, but
the Amalekites and the Amulonites
were still harder; therefore they
did cause the Lamanites that they
should harden their hearts, that
they should wax strong in wicked-
ness and their abominations.

4 And it came to pass that Aaron
came to the city of Jerusalem, and
