“never would come to war again
against them.

20 And it came to pass that Moroni
caused that the work of death should
“cease again among the people. And
he took the weapons of war from
the Lamanites; and after they had
entered into a *covenant with him
of peace they were suffered to de-
part into the wilderness.

21 Now the number of their dead
was not numbered because of the
greatness of the number; yea, the
number of their dead was exceed-
ingly great, both on the Nephites
and on the Lamanites.

22 And it came to pass that they
did cast their dead into the waters
of Sidon, and they have gone forth
and are buried in the depths of
the “sea.

23 And the armies of the Nephites,
or of Moroni, returned and came to
their houses and their lands.

24 And thus ended the eighteenth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi. And thus ended
the record of Alma, which was writ-
ten upon the plates of Nephi.

The account of the people of Nephi,
and their wars and dissensions, in
the days of Helaman, according to
the record of Helaman, which he
kept in his days.

Comprising chapters 45 through 62.

CHAPTER 45

Helaman believes the words of Alma—
Alma prophesies the destruction of the
Nephites—He blesses and curses the
land—Alma may have been taken up
by the Spirit, even as Moses—Dissen-
sion grows in the Church. About 73 B.c.

BEHOLD, now it came to pass that the

 

people of Nephi were exceedingly
rejoiced, because the Lord had again
«delivered them out of the hands of
their enemies; therefore they gave
thanks unto the Lord their God; yea,
and they did *fast much and pray
much, and they did worship God
with exceedingly great joy.

2 And it came to pass in the nine-
teenth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi, that Alma
came unto his son Helaman and
said unto him: Believest thou the
words which I spake unto thee con-
cerning those ‘records which have
been kept?

3 And Helaman said unto him:
Yea, I “believe.

4 And Alma said again: Believest
thou in Jesus Christ, who shall come?

5 And he said: Yea, I believe all
the words which thou hast spoken.

6 And Alma said unto him again:
Will ye “keep my commandments?

7 And he said: Yea, I will keep thy
commandments with all my heart.

8 Then Alma said unto him: Blessed
art thou; and the Lord shall “pros-
per thee in this land.

9 But behold, I have somewhat
to “prophesy unto thee; but what
I prophesy unto thee ye shall not
make known; yea, what I prophesy
unto thee shall not be made known,
even until the prophecy is fulfilled;
therefore write the words which I
shall say.

10 And these are the words: Be-
hold, I perceive that this very peo-
ple, the Nephites, according to the
spirit of revelation which is in me,
in ¢four hundred years from the
time that Jesus Christ shall manifest
himself unto them, shall dwindle in
*unbelief.

11 Yea, and then shall they see
wars and pestilences, yea, fam-
ines and bloodshed, even until the
