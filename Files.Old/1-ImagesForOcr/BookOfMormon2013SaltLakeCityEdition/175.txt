CHAPTER 10

King Laman dies—His people are wild
and ferocious and believe in false tra-
ditions—Zeniff and his people prevail
against them. About 187-160 B.c.

AND it came to pass that we again
began to establish the kingdom and
we again began to possess the land
in peace. And I caused that there
should be ‘weapons of war made
of every kind, that thereby I might
have weapons for my people against
the time the Lamanites should come
up again to war against my people.

2 And I set guards round about
the land, that the Lamanites might
not come upon us again unawares
and destroy us; and thus I did guard
my people and my flocks, and keep
them from falling into the hands
of our enemies.

3 And it came to pass that we did
inherit the land of our fathers for
many years, yea, for the space of
twenty and two years.

4 And I did cause that the men
should till the ground, and raise all
manner of “grain and all manner
of fruit of every kind.

5 And I did cause that the women
should spin, and toil, and work, and
work all manner of fine linen, yea,
and “cloth of every kind, that we
might clothe our nakedness; and
thus we did prosper in the land—
thus we did have continual peace
in the land for the space of twenty
and two years.

6 And it came to pass that king
«Laman died, and his son began to
reign in his stead. And he began
to stir his people up in rebellion
against my people; therefore they
began to prepare for war, and to
come up to battle against my people.

7 But Lhad sent my spies out round
about the land of “Shemlon, that 1

 

might discover their preparations,
that I might guard against them,
that they might not come upon my
people and destroy them.

8 And it came to pass that they
came up upon the north of the
land of Shilom, with their numer-
ous hosts, men “armed with *bows,
and with arrows, and with swords,
and with cimeters, and with
stones, and with slings; and they had
their heads shaved that they were
naked; and they were girded witha
leathern girdle about their loins.

9 And it came to pass that I caused
that the women and children of my
people should be hid in the wilder-
ness; and I also caused that all my
old men that could bear arms, and
also all my young men that were
able to bear arms, should gather
themselves together to go to battle
against the Lamanites; and I did
place them in their ranks, every
man according to his age.

10 And it came to pass that we did
go up to battle against the Lamanites;
and L, even I, in my old age, did go
up to battle against the Lamanites.
And it came to pass that we did go up
in the “strength of the Lord to battle.

11 Now, the Lamanites knew noth-
ing concerning the Lord, nor the
strength of the Lord, therefore they
depended upon their own strength.
Yet they were a strong people, as
to the “strength of men.

12 They were a “wild, and fero-
cious, and a blood-thirsty people,
believing in the “tradition of their
fathers, which is this—Believing
that they were driven out of the land
of Jerusalem because of the iniqui-
ties of their fathers, and that they
were ‘wronged in the wilderness by
their brethren, and they were also
wronged while crossing the sea;
