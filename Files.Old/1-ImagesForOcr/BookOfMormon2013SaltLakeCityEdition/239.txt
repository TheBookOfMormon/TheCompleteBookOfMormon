yea, and even more tolerable for
them in this life than for you, ex-
cept ye repent.

16 For there are many promises
which are “extended to the Laman-
ites; for it is because of the *tradi-
tions of their fathers that caused
them to remain in their state of
“ignorance; therefore the Lord will
be merciful unto them and “prolong
their existence in the land.

17 And at some period of time
they will be “brought to believe in
his word, and to know of the incor-
rectness of the traditions of their
fathers; and many of them will be
saved, for the Lord will be merci-
ful unto all who *call on his name.

18 But behold, I say unto you that
if ye persist in your wickedness that
your days shall not be “prolonged
in the land, for the *Lamanites shall
be sent upon you; and if ye repent
not they shall come in atime when
you know not, and ye shall be vis-
ited with ‘utter destruction; and
it shall be according to the fierce
4anger of the Lord.

19 For he will not suffer you that
ye shall live in your iniquities,
to 4destroy his people. I say unto
you, Nay; he would rather suffer
that the Lamanites might destroy
all his people who are called the
people of Nephi, if it were possible
that they could °fall into sins and
transgressions, after having had
so much light and so much knowl-
edge given unto them of the Lord
their God;

20 Yea, after having been such a
highly favored people of the Lord;
yea, after having been favored
above every other ‘nation, kindred,

 

tongue, or people; after having had
all things made known unto them,
according to their desires, and their
faith, and prayers, of that which has
been, and which is, and which is
to come;

21 Having been “visited by the
Spirit of God; having conversed
with angels, and having been spo-
ken unto by the voice of the Lord;
and having the spirit of prophecy,
and the spirit of revelation, and also
many gifts, the gift of speaking with
tongues, and the gift of preaching,
and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and
the gift of *translation;

22 Yea, and after having been
“delivered of God out of the land
of Jerusalem, by the hand of the
Lord; having been *saved from
famine, and from sickness, and all
manner of diseases of every kind;
and they having waxed strong in
battle, that they might not be de-
stroyed; having been brought out of
‘bondage time after time, and hav-
ing been kept and preserved until
now; and they have been prospered.
until they are rich in all manner of
things—

23 And now behold I say unto you,
that if this people, who have re-
ceived so many blessings from the
hand of the Lord, should transgress
“contrary to the light and knowl-
edge which they do have, I say unto
you that if this be the case, that if
they should fall into transgression,
it would be far more "tolerable for
the Lamanites than for them.

24 For behold, the “promises of the
Lord are extended to the Lamanites,
but they are not unto you if ye trans-
gress; for has not the Lord expressly
