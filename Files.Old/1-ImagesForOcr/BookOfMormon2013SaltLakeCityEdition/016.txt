21 And it came to pass that af-
ter this manner of language did I
“persuade my brethren, that they
might be faithful in keeping the
commandments of God.

22 And it came to pass that we
went down to the land of our inheri-
tance, and we did gather together
our “gold, and our silver, and our
precious things.

23 And after we had gathered these
things together, we went up again
unto the house of Laban.

24 And it came to pass that we
went in unto Laban, and desired
him that he would give unto us the
records which were engraven upon
the “plates of brass, for which we
would give unto him our gold, and our
silver, and all our precious things.

25 And it came to pass that when
Laban saw our property, and that it
was exceedingly great, he did “lust
after it, insomuch that he thrust us
out, and sent his servants to slay us,
that he might obtain our property.

26 And “it came to pass that we
did flee before the servants of La-
ban, and we were obliged to leave
behind our property, and it fell into
the hands of Laban.

27 And it came to pass that we
fled into the wilderness, and the
servants of Laban did not overtake
us, and we “hid ourselves in the
cavity of a rock.

28 And it came to pass that Laman
was angry with me, and also with
my father; and also was Lemuel,
for he hearkened unto the words
of Laman. Wherefore Laman and
Lemuel did speak many “hard words
unto us, their younger brothers, and
they did smite us even with a rod.

29 And it came to pass as they

 

smote us with a rod, behold, an
“angel of the Lord came and stood
before them, and he spake unto
them, saying: Why do ye smite your
younger brother with a rod? Know
ye not that the Lord hath chosen
him to be a ’ruler over you, and this
because of your iniquities? Behold
ye shall go up to Jerusalem again,
and the Lord will ‘deliver Laban
into your hands.

30 And after the “angel had spo-
ken unto us, he departed.

31 And after the angel had de-
parted, Laman and Lemuel again
began to “murmur, saying: How is
it possible that the Lord will deliver
Laban into our hands? Behold, he
is a mighty man, and he can com-
mand fifty, yea, even he can slay
fifty; then why not us?

CHAPTER 4

Nephi slays Laban at the Lord’s com-
mand and then secures the plates of
brass by stratagem—Zoram chooses
to join Lehi’s family in the wilderness.
About 600-592 B.C.

AND it came to pass that I spake
unto my brethren, saying: Let us
go up again unto Jerusalem, and
let us be “faithful in keeping the
commandments of the Lord; for
behold he is mightier than all the
earth, then why not *mightier than
Laban and his fifty, yea, or even
than his tens of thousands?

2 Therefore let us go up; let us
be “strong like unto Moses; for he
truly spake unto the waters of the
’Red Sea and they divided hither
and thither, and our fathers came
through, out of captivity, on dry
ground, and the armies of Pharaoh
