“decoy the Lamanites out of their
strongholds.

22 Therefore he caused that Te-
ancum should take a small num-
ber of men and march down near
the seashore; and Moroni and his
army, by night, marched in the
wilderness, on the west of the city
“Mulek; and thus, on the morrow,
when the guards of the Lamanites
had discovered Teancum, they ran
and told it unto Jacob, their leader.

23 And it came to pass that the
armies of the Lamanites did march
forth against Teancum, supposing
by their numbers to overpower Te-
ancum because of the smallness of
his numbers. And as Teancum saw
the armies of the Lamanites coming
out against him he began to retreat
down by the seashore, northward.

24 And it came to pass that when
the Lamanites saw that he began
to flee, they took courage and pur-
sued them with vigor. And while
Teancum was thus leading away
the Lamanites who were pursu-
ing them in vain, behold, Moroni
commanded that a part of his army
who were with him should march
forth into the city, and take pos-
session of it.

25 And thus they did, and slew
all those who had been left to pro-
tect the city, yea, all those who
would not “yield up their weapons
of war.

26 And thus Moroni had obtained
possession of the city Mulek witha
part of his army, while he marched
with the remainder to meet the La-
manites when they should return
from the pursuit of Teancum.

27 And it came to pass that the La-
manites did pursue Teancum until
they came near the city Bountiful,
and then they were met by Lehi
and a small army, which had been
left to protect the city Bountiful.

28 And now behold, when the
chief captains of the Lamanites had
beheld Lehi with his army coming

 

against them, they fled in much con-
fusion, lest perhaps they should not
obtain the city Mulek before Lehi
should overtake them; for they were
wearied because of their march, and
the men of Lehi were fresh.

29 Now the Lamanites did not
know that Moroni had been in their
rear with his army; and all they
feared was Lehi and his men.

30 Now Lehi was not desirous to
overtake them till they should meet
Moroni and his army.

31 And it came to pass that before
the Lamanites had retreated far they
were surrounded by the Nephites,
by the men of Moroni on one hand,
and the men of Lehi on the other,
all of whom were fresh and full of
strength; but the Lamanites were
wearied because of their long march.

32 And Moroni commanded his
men that they should fall upon
them until they had given up their
weapons of war.

33 And it came to pass that Jacob,
being their leader, being also a
“Zoramite, and having an uncon-
querable spirit, he led the Laman-
ites forth to battle with exceeding
fury against Moroni.

34 Moroni being in their course of
march, therefore Jacob was deter-
mined to slay them and cut his way
through to the city of Mulek. But
behold, Moroni and his men were
more powerful; therefore they did
not give way before the Lamanites.

35 And it came to pass that they
fought on both hands with exceed-
ing fury; and there were many slain
on both sides; yea, and Moroni was
wounded and Jacob was killed.

36 And Lehi pressed upon their
rear with such fury with his strong
men, that the Lamanites in the rear
delivered up their weapons of war;
and the remainder of them, being
much confused, knew not whither
to go or to strike.

37 Now Moroni seeing their con-
fusion, he said unto them: If ye will
