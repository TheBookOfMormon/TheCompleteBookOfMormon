CHAPTER 8

The baptism of little children is an
evil abomination—Little children are
alive in Christ because of the Atone-
ment—Faith, repentance, meekness and
lowliness of heart, receiving the Holy
Ghost, and enduring to the end lead to
salvation. About A.D. 401-21.

AN epistle of my “father Mormon,
written to me, Moroni; and it was
written unto me soon after my call-
ing to the ministry. And on this
wise did he write unto me, saying:

2 My beloved son, Moroni, I rejoice
exceedingly that your Lord Jesus
Christ hath been mindful of you,
and hath called you to his ministry,
and to his holy work.

31am mindful of you always in
my prayers, continually praying
unto God the Father in the name
of his Holy Child, Jesus, that he,
through his infinite “goodness and
*grace, will keep you through the
endurance of faith on his name to
the end.

4 And now, my son, I speak unto
you concerning that which griev-
eth me exceedingly; for it grieveth
me that there should “disputations
rise among you.

5 For, if I have learned the truth,
there have been disputations among
you concerning the baptism of your
little children.

6 And now, my son, I desire that
ye should labor diligently, that this
gross error should be removed from

 

among you; for, for this intent I have
written this epistle.

7 For immediately after I had
learned these things of you I in-
quired of the Lord concerning the
matter. And the “word of the Lord
came to me by the power of the
Holy Ghost, saying:

8 «Listen to the words of Christ,
your Redeemer, your Lord and
your God. Behold, I came into the
world not to call the righteous but
sinners to repentance; the 'whole
need no physician, but they that are
sick; wherefore, little ‘children are
4whole, for they are not capable
of committing ‘sin; wherefore the
curse of ‘Adam is taken from them
in me, that it hath no power over
them; and the law of ‘circumcision
is done away in me.

9 And after this manner did the
Holy Ghost manifest the word of
God unto me; wherefore, my be-
loved son, I know that it is solemn
mockery before God, that ye should
baptize little children.

10 Behold I say unto you that this
thing shall ye teach—repentance
and baptism unto those who are
accountable and capable of com-
mitting sin; yea, teach parents that
they must repent and be baptized,
and humble themselves as their
little *children, and they shall all
be saved with their little children.

11 And their little «children need
no repentance, neither baptism. Be-
hold, baptism is unto repentance to
the fulfilling the commandments
unto the ’remission of sins.

12 But little “children are alive in
Christ, even from the foundation of
the world; if not so, God is a partial
