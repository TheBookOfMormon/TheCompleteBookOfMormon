him, and ye shall find blood upon
the skirts of his cloak.

32 And when ye have seen this,
ye shall say: From whence cometh
this blood? Do we not know that it
is the blood of your brother?

33 And then shall he tremble, and
shall look pale, even as if death had
come upon him.

34 And then shall ye say: Because
of this fear and this paleness which
has come upon your face, behold,
we know that thou art guilty.

35 And then shall greater fear
come upon him; and then shall he
confess unto you, and deny no more
that he has done this murder.

36 And then shall he say unto
you, that I, Nephi, know nothing
concerning the matter save it were
given unto me by the power of God.
And then shall ye know that I am
an honest man, and that I am sent
unto you from God.

37 And it came to pass that they
went and did, even according as
Nephi had said unto them. And be-
hold, the words which he had said
were true; for according to the words
he did deny; and also according to
the words he did confess.

38 And he was brought to prove
that he himself was the very mur-
derer, insomuch that the five were
set at liberty, and also was Nephi.

39 And there were some of the
Nephites who believed on the words
of Nephi; and there were some
also, who believed because of the
testimony of the five, for they had
been converted while they were
in prison.

40 And now there were some
among the people, who said that
Nephi was a prophet.

41 And there were others who said:
Behold, he is a god, for except he
was a god he could not “know of.
all things. For behold, he has told

 

us the thoughts of our hearts, and
also has told us things; and even
he has brought unto our knowl-
edge the true murderer of our chief
judge.

CHAPTER 10

The Lord gives Nephi the sealing
power—He is empowered to bind and
loose on earth and in heaven—He com-
mands the people to repent or perish—
The Spirit carries him from multitude
to multitude. About 21-20 B.c.

AND it came to pass that there arose
a division among the people, inso-
much that they divided hither and
thither and went their ways, leaving
Nephi alone, as he was standing in
the midst of them.

2 And it came to pass that Nephi
went his way towards his own house,
“pondering upon the things which
the Lord had shown unto him.

3 And it came to pass as he was
thus pondering—being much cast
down because of the wickedness of
the people of the Nephites, their
secret works of darkness, and their
murderings, and their plunderings,
and all manner of iniquities—and
it came to pass as he was thus pon-
dering in his heart, behold, a “voice
came unto him saying:

4 “Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those
things which thou hast done; for
I have beheld how thou hast with
*’unwearyingness declared the word,
which I have given unto thee, unto
this people. And thou hast not feared
them, and hast not sought thine
sown life, but hast sought my will,
and to keep my commandments.

5 And now, because thou hast done
this with such unwearyingness, be-
hold, I will bless thee forever; and I
will make thee mighty in word and
in deed, in faith and in works; yea,
even that “all things shall be "done
