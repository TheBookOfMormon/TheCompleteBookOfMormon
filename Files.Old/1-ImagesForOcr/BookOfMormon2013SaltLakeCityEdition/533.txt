long as time shall last, or the earth
shall stand, or there shall be one man
upon the face thereof to be saved?

37 Behold I say unto you, Nay;
for it is by faith that ‘miracles are
wrought; and it is by faith that an-
gels appear and minister unto men;
wherefore, if these things have
ceased wo be unto the children of
men, for it is because of °unbelief,
and all is vain.

38 For no man can be saved, ac-
cording to the words of Christ, save
they shall have faith in his name;
wherefore, if these things have
ceased, then has faith ceased also;
and awful is the state of man, for
they are as though there had been
no redemption made.

39 But behold, my beloved breth-
ren, I judge better things of you, for
I judge that ye have faith in Christ
because of your meekness; for if ye
have not faith in him then ye are
not “fit to be numbered among the
people of his church.

40 And again, my beloved brethren,
I would speak unto you concerning
“hope. How is it that ye can attain
unto faith, save ye shall have hope?

41 And what is it that ye shall
“hope for? Behold I say unto you
that ye shall have *hope through the
atonement of Christ and the power
of his resurrection, to be raised
unto life ‘eternal, and this because
of your faith in him according to
the promise.

42 Wherefore, if a man have “faith
he ’must needs have hope; for with-
out faith there cannot be any hope.

 

43 And again, behold I say unto
you that he cannot have faith and
hope, save he shall be «meek, and
lowly of heart.

44 If so, his “faith and hope is vain,
for none is *acceptable before God,
save the ‘meek and lowly in heart;
and if a man be meek and lowly in
heart, and “confesses by the power
of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the
Christ, he must needs have char-
ity; for if he have not charity he is
nothing; wherefore he must needs
have charity.

45 And “charity suffereth long, and
is °kind, and ‘envieth not, and is not
puffed up, seeketh not her own, is
not easily “provoked, thinketh no
evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity
but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth
all things, believeth all things, hop-
eth all things, endureth all things.

46 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, if ye have not charity, ye are
nothing, for charity never faileth.
Wherefore, cleave unto charity,
which is the greatest of all, for all
things must fail—

47 But “charity is the pure ‘love
of Christ, and it endureth ‘forever;
and whoso is found possessed of
it at the last day, it shall be well
with him.

48 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, “pray unto the Father with all
the energy of heart, that ye may be
filled with this love, which he hath
bestowed upon all who are true
*followers of his Son, Jesus Christ;
that ye may become the sons of
God; that when he shall appear we
