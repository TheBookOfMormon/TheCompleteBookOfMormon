3 And Aminadi was a descendant
of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi,
who came out of the land of Jeru-
salem, who was a descendant of
«Manasseh, who was the son of.
’Joseph who was ‘sold into Egypt
by the hands of his brethren.

4 And behold, I am also a man of
no small ¢reputation among all those
who know me; yea, and behold, IL
have many kindreds and °friends,
and [have also acquired much riches
by the hand of my ‘industry.

5 Nevertheless, after all this, I
never have known much of the
ways of the Lord, and his “mysteries
and marvelous power. I said I never
had known much of these things;
but behold, I mistake, for I have
seen much of his mysteries and his
marvelous power; yea, even in the
preservation of the lives of this
people.

6 Nevertheless, I did harden my
heart, for I was “called many times
and I would not *hear; therefore I
knew concerning these things, yet
I would not know; therefore I went
on rebelling ‘against God, in the
wickedness of my heart, even un-
til the fourth day of this seventh
month, which is in the tenth year
of the reign of the judges.

7 As Lwas journeying to see a very
near kindred, behold an “angel of
the Lord appeared unto me and
said: Amulek, return to thine own
house, for thou shalt feed a prophet
of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is
a chosen man of God; for he has
*fasted many days because of the
sins of this people, and he is an hun-
gered, and thou shalt ‘receive him
into thy house and feed him, and
he shall bless thee and thy house;

 

and the blessing of the Lord shall
rest upon thee and thy house.

8 And it came to pass that I obeyed
the voice of the angel, and returned
towards my house. And as I was go-
ing thither I found the “man whom
the angel said unto me: Thou shalt
receive into thy house—and behold
it was this same man who has been
speaking unto you concerning the
things of God.

9 And the angel said unto me he is
a “holy man; wherefore I know he
is a holy man because it was said
by an angel of God.

10 And again, I know that the
things whereof he hath testified
are true; for behold I say unto you,
that as the Lord liveth, even so has he
sent his “angel to make these things
manifest unto me; and this he has
done while this Alma hath *dwelt
at my house.

11 For behold, he hath “blessed
mine house, he hath blessed me,
and my women, and my children,
and my father and my kinsfolk; yea,
even all my kindred hath he blessed,
and the blessing of the Lord hath
rested upon us according to the
words which he spake.

12 And now, when Amulek had
spoken these words the people be-
gan to be astonished, seeing there
was “more than one witness who
testified of the things whereof they
were accused, and also of the things
which were to come, according to
the spirit of prophecy which was
in them.

13 Nevertheless, there were some
among them who thought to ques-
tion them, that by their cunning
“devices they might catch them in
their words, that they might find
