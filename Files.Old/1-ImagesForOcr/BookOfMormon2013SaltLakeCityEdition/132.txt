how much better are you than they,
in the sight of your great Creator?

8 O my brethren, I fear that unless
ye shall repent of your sins that their
skins will be ‘whiter than yours,
when ye shall be brought with them
before the throne of God.

9 Wherefore, a commandment I
give unto you, which is the word
of God, that ye “‘revile no more
against them because of the dark-
ness of their skins; neither shall ye
revile against them because of their
filthiness; but ye shall remember
your own filthiness, and remember
that their filthiness came because
of their fathers.

10 Wherefore, ye shall remember
your “children, how that ye have
grieved their hearts because of the
*’example that ye have set before
them; and also, remember that ye
may, because of your filthiness,
bring your children unto destruc-
tion, and their sins be heaped upon
your heads at the last day.

11 O my brethren, hearken unto
my words; “arouse the faculties of
your souls; shake yourselves that
ye may ‘awake from the slumber
of death; and loose yourselves from
the pains of ‘hell that ye may not
become ‘angels to the devil, to be
cast into that lake of fire and brim-
stone which is the second ‘death.

12 And now I, Jacob, spake many
more things unto the people of
Nephi, ‘warning them against *for-
nication and ‘lasciviousness, and
every kind of sin, telling them the
awful consequences of them.

13 And a hundredth part of the
proceedings of this people, which
now began to be numerous, can-
not be written upon “these plates;

 

but many of their proceedings are
written upon the *larger plates, and
their wars, and their contentions,
and the reigns of their kings.

14 *These plates are called the
plates of Jacob, and they were "made
by the hand of Nephi. And I make
an end of speaking these words.

CHAPTER 4

All the prophets worshiped the Father
in the name of Christ—Abraham’s of-
fering of Isaac was in similitude of God
and His Only Begotten—Men should
reconcile themselves to God through the
Atonement—The Jews will reject the
foundation stone. About 544-421 B.C.

Now behold, it came to pass that
I, Jacob, having ministered much
unto my people in word, (and I
cannot write but a “little of my
words, because of the *difficulty of
engraving our words upon plates)
and we know that the things which
we write upon plates must remain;

2 But whatsoever things we write
upon anything save it be upon
“plates must perish and vanish away;
but we can write a few words upon
plates, which will give our chil-
dren, and also our beloved breth-
ren, a small degree of knowledge
concerning us, or concerning their
fathers—

3 Now in this thing we do rejoice;
and we labor diligently to engraven
these words upon plates, hoping
that our beloved brethren and our
children will receive them with
thankful hearts, and look upon
them that they may learn with joy
and not with sorrow, neither with
contempt, concerning their first
“parents.
