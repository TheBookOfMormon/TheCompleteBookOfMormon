parts of the vineyard, some in one
and some in another, according to
his will and pleasure.

15 And it came to pass that a long
time passed away, and the Lord
of the vineyard said unto his ser-
vant: Come, let us go down into
the vineyard, that we may “labor
in the vineyard.

16 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard, and also the
servant, went down into the vine-
yard to labor. And it came to pass
that the servant said unto his master:
Behold, look here; behold the tree.

17 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard looked and be-
held the tree in the which the wild
olive branches had been grafted;
and it had sprung forth and begun
to bear “fruit. And he beheld that it
was good; and the fruit thereof was
like unto the natural fruit.

18 And he said unto the servant:
Behold, the branches of the wild
tree have taken hold of the mois-
ture of the root thereof, that the
root thereof hath brought forth
much strength; and because of the
much strength of the root thereof
the wild branches have brought
forth tame fruit. Now, if we had not
grafted in these branches, the tree
thereof would have perished. And
now, behold, I shall lay up much
fruit, which the tree thereof hath
brought forth; and the fruit thereof
I shall lay up against the season,
unto mine own self.

19 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard said unto
the servant: Come, let us go to the
nethermost part of the vineyard,
and behold if the natural branches
of the tree have not brought forth
much fruit also, that I may lay up
of the fruit thereof against the sea-
son, unto mine own self.

20 And it came to pass that they

 

went forth whither the master had
hid the natural branches of the
tree, and he said unto the servant:
Behold these; and he beheld the
“first that it had *brought forth
much fruit; and he beheld also that
it was good. And he said unto the
servant: Take of the fruit thereof,
and lay it up against the season,
that I may preserve it unto mine
own self; for behold, said he, this
long time have I nourished it, and
it hath brought forth much fruit.

21 And it came to pass that the
servant said unto his master: How
comest thou hither to plant this
tree, or this branch of the tree? For
behold, it was the poorest spot in
all the land of thy vineyard.

22 And the Lord of the vineyard
said unto him: Counsel me not; I
knew that it was a poor spot of
ground; wherefore, I said unto thee,
I have nourished it this long time,
and thou beholdest that it hath
brought forth much fruit.

23 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard said unto his
servant: Look hither; behold I have
planted another branch of the tree
also; and thou knowest that this spot
of ground was poorer than the first.
But, behold the tree. 1 have nour-
ished it this long time, and it hath
brought forth much fruit; therefore,
gather it, and lay it up against the
season, that I may preserve it unto
mine own self.

24 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard said again unto
his servant: Look hither, and behold
another “branch also, which I have
planted; behold that I have nour-
ished it also, and it hath brought
forth fruit.

25 And he said unto the servant:
Look hither and behold the last.
Behold, this have I planted in a
“good spot of ground; and I have
