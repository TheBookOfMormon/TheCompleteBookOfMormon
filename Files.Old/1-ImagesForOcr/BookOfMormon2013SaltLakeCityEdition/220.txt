make war on the Nephites and are de-
feated—The Lamanites and Amlicites
join forces and are defeated—Alma
slays Amlici. About 87 B.C.

AND it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the fifth year of their
reign there began to be acontention
among the people; for a certain
«man, being called Amlici, he being
a very cunning man, yea, a wise
man as to the wisdom of the world,
he being after the order of the man
that slew *Gideon by the sword, who
was executed according to the law—

2 Now this Amlici had, by his cun-
ning, “drawn away much people
after him; even so much that they
began to be very powerful; and they
began to endeavor to establish Am-
lici to be a king over the people.

3 Now this was alarming to the
people of the church, and also to all
those who had not been drawn away
after the persuasions of Amlici;
for they knew that according to their
law that such things must be estab-
lished by the “voice of the people.

4 Therefore, if it were possible
that Amlici should gain the voice
of the people, he, being a wicked
man, would “deprive them of their
rights and privileges of the church;
for it was his intent to destroy the
church of God.

5 And it came to pass that the peo-
ple assembled themselves together
throughout all the land, every man
according to his mind, whether it
were for or against Amlici, in sepa-
rate bodies, having much dispute
and wonderful ‘contentions one
with another.

6 And thus they did assemble
themselves together to cast in their
“voices concerning the matter; and
they were laid before the judges.

 

7 And it came to pass that the
“voice of the people came against
Amlici, that he was not made king
over the people.

8 Now this did cause much joy
in the hearts of those who were
against him; but Amlici did stir up
those who were in his favor to anger
against those who were not in his
favor.

9 And it came to pass that they
gathered themselves together, and
did “consecrate Amlici to be their
king.

10 Now when Amlici was made
king over them he commanded
them that they should take up arms
against their brethren; and this
he did that he might subject them
to him.

11 Now the people of Amlici were
distinguished by the name of Am-
lici, being called “Amlicites; and the
remainder were *called Nephites,
or the people of God.

12 Therefore the people of the
Nephites were aware of the intent
of the Amlicites, and therefore they
did prepare to meet them; yea,
they did arm themselves with swords,
and with cimeters, and with bows,and
with arrows, and with stones, and
with slings, and with all manner
of ‘weapons of war, of every kind.

13 And thus they were prepared
to meet the Amlicites at the time
of their coming. And there were
appointed ‘captains, and higher
captains, and chief captains, ac-
cording to their numbers.

14 And it came to pass that Amlici
did arm his men with all manner of
weapons of war of every kind; and
he also appointed rulers and lead-
ers over his people, to lead them to
war against their brethren.
