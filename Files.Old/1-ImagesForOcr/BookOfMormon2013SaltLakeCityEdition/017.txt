did follow and were drowned in the
waters of the Red Sea.

3 Now behold ye know that this is
true; and ye also know that an “an-
gel hath spoken unto you; where-
fore can ye "doubt? Let us go up; the
Lord is able to “deliver us, even as
our fathers, and to destroy Laban,
even as the Egyptians.

4 Now when I had spoken these
words, they were yet wroth, and did
still continue to murmur; neverthe-
less they did follow me up until we
came without the walls of Jerusalem.

5 And it was by night; and I caused
that they should hide themselves
without the walls. And after they
had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept
into the city and went forth towards
the house of Laban.

6 And I was “led by the Spirit, not
knowing beforehand the things
which I should do.

7 Nevertheless I went forth, and
as I came near unto the house of
Laban I beheld a man, and he had
fallen to the earth before me, for
he was “drunken with wine.

8 And when I came to him I found
that it was Laban.

9 And I beheld his “sword, and
I drew it forth from the sheath
thereof; and the hilt thereof was
of pure gold, and the workmanship
thereof was exceedingly fine, and
I saw that the blade thereof was of
the most precious steel.

10 And it came to pass that I was
“constrained by the Spirit that I
should kill Laban; but I said in my
heart: Never at any time have I shed
the blood of man. And I shrunk and
would that I might not slay him.

 

11 And the Spirit said unto me
again: Behold the “Lord hath *deliv-

I also knew that he had sought to
take away mine own life; yea, and
he would not hearken unto the
commandments of the Lord; and he
also had ‘taken away our property.

12 And it came to pass that the
Spirit said unto me again: Slay him,
for the Lord hath delivered him
into thy hands;

13 Behold the Lord “slayeth the
bwicked to bring forth his righ-
teous purposes. It is ‘better that
one man should perish than that a
nation should dwindle and perish
in ‘unbelief.

14 And now, when I, Nephi, had
heard these words, I remembered
the words of the Lord which he
spake unto me in the wilderness,
saying that: “Inasmuch as thy seed
shall keep my *commandments,
they shall ‘prosper in the ‘land of
promise.

15 Yea, and L also thought that they
could not keep the commandments
of the Lord according to the “law of
Moses, save they should have the law.

16 And I also knew that the “law
was engraven upon the plates of
brass.

17 And again, I knew that the Lord
had delivered Laban into my hands
for this cause—that I might obtain
the records according to his com-
mandments.

18 Therefore I did obey the voice
of the Spirit, and took Laban by
the hair of the head, and I smote
off his head with his own “sword.

19 And after I had smitten off his
