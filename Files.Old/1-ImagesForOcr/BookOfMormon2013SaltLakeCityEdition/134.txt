Begotten Son, and ye may obtain
a “resurrection, according to the
“power of the resurrection which
is in Christ, and be presented as
the ‘first-fruits of Christ unto God,
having faith, and obtained a good
hope of glory in him before he
manifesteth himself in the flesh.

12 And now, beloved, marvel not
that I tell you these things; for
why not “speak of the atonement
of Christ, and attain to a perfect
knowledge of him, as to attain to
the knowledge of a resurrection
and the world to come?

13 Behold, my brethren, he that
prophesieth, let him prophesy to the
understanding of men; for the “Spirit
speaketh the *truth and lieth not.
Wherefore, it speaketh of things as
they really ‘are, and of things as they
really will be; wherefore, these things
are manifested unto us “plainly,
for the salvation of our souls. But
behold, we are not witnesses alone
in these things; for God also ‘spake
them unto prophets of old.

14 But behold, the Jews were a
*stiffnecked people; and they °de-
spised the words of ‘plainness, and
4killed the prophets, and sought for
things that they could not under-
stand. Wherefore, because of their
“blindness, which ‘blindness came
by looking beyond the ‘mark, they
must needs fall; for God hath taken
away his plainness from them, and
delivered unto them many things
which they “cannot understand, be-

 

cause they desired it. And because
they desired it God hath done it,
that they may ‘stumble.

15 And now, Jacob, am led on by
the Spirit unto prophesying; for I
perceive by the workings of the Spirit
which is in me, that by the “stum-
bling of the *Jews they will ‘reject
the ‘stone upon which they might
build and have safe foundation.

16 But behold, according to the
scriptures, this “stone shall become
the great, and the last, and the only
sure foundation, upon which the
Jews can build.

17 And now, my beloved, how is
it possible that these, after having
rejected the sure foundation, can
“ever build upon it, that it may be-
come the head of their corner?

18 Behold, my beloved brethren,
I will unfold this mystery unto
you; if I do not, by any means, get
shaken from my firmness in the
Spirit, and stumble because of my
over anxiety for you.

CHAPTER 5

Jacob quotes Zenos relative to the alle-
gory of the tame and wild olive trees—
They are a likeness of Israel and the
Gentiles—The scattering and gathering
of Israel are prefigured—Allusions are
made to the Nephites and Lamanites
and all the house of Israel—The Gen-
tiles will be grafted into Israel—Eventu-
ally the vineyard will be burned. About
