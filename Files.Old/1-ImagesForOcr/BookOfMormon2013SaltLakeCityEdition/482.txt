this people—Repent ye, and come
unto me, and be ye baptized, and
build up again my church, and ye
shall be “spared.

3 And I did cry unto this people,
but it was “in vain; and they did
’not realize that it was the Lord
that had spared them, and granted
unto them a chance for repentance.
And behold they did harden their
hearts against the Lord their God.

4 And it came to pass that after
this tenth year had passed away,
making, in the whole, three hundred
and sixty years from the coming of
Christ, the king of the Lamanites
sent an epistle unto me, which gave
unto me to know that they were
preparing to come again to battle
against us.

5 And it came to pass that I did
cause my people that they should
gather themselves together at the
land “Desolation, to a city which was
in the borders, by the narrow pass
which led into the land *southward.

6 And there we did place our
armies, that we might stop the
armies of the Lamanites, that they
might not get possession of any of
our lands; therefore we did fortify
against them with all our force.

7 And it came to pass that in the
three hundred and sixty and first
year the Lamanites did come down
to the “city of Desolation to battle
against us; and it came to pass that
in that year we did beat them, inso-
much that they did return to their
own lands again.

8 And in the three hundred and
sixty and second year they did
come down ¢again to battle. And
we did beat them again, and did

 

slay a great number of them, and
their dead were cast into the sea.

9 And now, because of this great
thing which my people, the Neph-

in their own strength, and began
to swear before the heavens that
they would avenge themselves of
the blood of their brethren who
had been slain by their enemies.

10 And they did “swear by the
heavens, and also by the throne
of God, that they *would go up to
battle against their enemies, and
would cut them off from the face of
the land.

11 And it came to pass that I, Mor-
mon, did utterly “refuse from this
time forth to be a commander and
a leader of this people, because of
their wickedness and abomination.

12 Behold, I had led them, notwith-
standing their wickedness I had led
them many times to battle, and had
loved them, according to the “love of
God which was in me, with all my
heart; and my soul had been poured
out in prayer unto my God all the
day long for them; nevertheless, it
was without faith, because of the
‘hardness of their hearts.

13 And “thrice have I delivered
them out of the hands of their en-
emies, and they have repented not
of their sins.

14 And when they had sworn by
all that had been “forbidden them
by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
that they would go up unto their
enemies to battle, and avenge them-
selves of the blood of their breth-

came unto me, saying:
