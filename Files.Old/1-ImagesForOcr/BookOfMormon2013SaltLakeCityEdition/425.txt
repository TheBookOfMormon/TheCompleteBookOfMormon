CHAPTER 5

The Nephites repent and forsake their
sins—Mormon writes the history of his
people and declares the everlasting word
to them—Israel will be gathered in from
her long dispersion. About A.D. 22-26.

AND now behold, there was not a
living soul among all the people
of the Nephites who did “doubt in
the least the words of all the holy
prophets who had spoken; for they
knew that it must needs be that
they must be fulfilled.

2 And they knew that it must be
expedient that Christ had come, be-
cause of the many signs which had
been given, according to the words
of the prophets; and because of the
things which had come to pass al-
ready they knew that it must needs
be that all things should come to
pass according to that which had
been spoken.

3 Therefore they did forsake all
their sins, and their abominations,
and their whoredoms, and did serve
God with all diligence day and night.

4 And now it came to pass that
when they had taken all the rob-
bers prisoners, insomuch that none
did escape who were not slain, they
did cast their prisoners into prison,
and did cause the word of God to be
preached unto them; and as many
as would repent of their sins and
“enter into a *covenant that they
would murder no more were set at
‘liberty.

5 But as many as there were who
did not enter into a covenant, and
who did still continue to have those
4secret murders in their hearts, yea,
as many as were found breathing
out threatenings against their breth-
ren were condemned and punished
according to the law.

6 And thus they did put an end

 

to all those wicked, and secret,
and abominable combinations,
in the which there was so much
wickedness, and so many murders
committed.

7 And thus had the “twenty and
second year passed away, and the
twenty and third year also, and the
twenty and fourth, and the twenty
and fifth; and thus had twenty and
five years passed away.

8 And there had many things tran-
spired which, in the eyes of some,
would be great and marvelous; nev-
ertheless, they cannot all be written
in this book; yea, this book cannot
contain even a “hundredth part
of what was done among so many
people in the space of twenty and
five years;

9 But behold there are “records
which do contain *all the proceed-
ings of this people; and a ‘shorter
but true account was given by
Nephi.

10 Therefore I have made my
“record of these things according
to the record of Nephi, which was
engraven on the plates which were
called the *plates of Nephi.

11 And behold, I do make the
record on plates which I have made
with mine own hands.

12 And behold, I am called ¢Mor-
mon, being called after the “land of
Mormon, the land in which Alma
did establish the church among the
people, yea, the first church which
was established among them after
their transgression.

13 Behold, Iam a disciple of Jesus
Christ, the Son of God. I have been
“called of him to declare his word
among his people, that they might
have everlasting life.

14 And it hath become expedient
that I, according to the will of God,
