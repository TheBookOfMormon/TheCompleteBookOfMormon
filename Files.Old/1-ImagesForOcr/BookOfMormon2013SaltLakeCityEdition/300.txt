40 And thus, if ye will not nourish
the word, looking forward with an
eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye
can never pluck of the fruit of the
“tree of life.

41 Butif ye will nourish the word,
yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth
to grow, by your faith with great
diligence, and with “patience, look-
ing forward to the fruit thereof, it
shall take root; and behold it shall
be a tree “springing up unto ever-
lasting life.

42 And because of your “diligence
and your faith and your patience
with the word in nourishing it, that
it may take root in you, behold, by
and by ye shall pluck the °fruit
thereof, which is most precious,
which is sweet above all that is
sweet, and which is white above all
that is white, yea, and pure above
all that is pure; and ye shall feast
upon this fruit even until ye are
filled, that ye hunger not, neither
shall ye thirst.

43 Then, my brethren, ye shall
“reap the *rewards of your faith,
and your diligence, and patience,
and long-suffering, waiting for the
tree to bring forth ‘fruit unto you.

CHAPTER 33

Zenos taught that men should pray and
worship in all places, and that judgments
are turned away because of the Son—
Zenock taught that mercy is bestowed
because of the Son—Moses had lifted
up in the wilderness a type of the Son
of God. About 74 B.c.

Now after Alma had spoken these
words, they sent forth unto him de-
siring to know whether they should
believe in “one God, that they might

 

obtain this fruit of which he had
spoken, or *how they should plant
the ‘seed, or the word of which he
had spoken, which he said must be
planted in their hearts; or in what
manner they should begin to exer-
cise their faith.

2 And Alma said unto them: Be-
hold, ye have said that ye “could
not *worship your God because ye
are cast out of your synagogues. But
behold, I say unto you, if ye suppose
that ye cannot worship God, ye do
greatly err, and ye ought to search
the ‘scriptures; if ye suppose that
they have taught you this, ye do not
understand them.

3 Do ye remember to have read
what “Zenos, the prophet of old, has
said concerning prayer or worship?

4 For he said: Thou art merciful, O
God, for thou hast heard my prayer,
even when I was “in the wilderness;
yea, thou wast merciful when I
prayed concerning those who were
mine "enemies, and thou didst turn
them to me.

5 Yea, O God, and thou wast mer-
ciful unto me when I did cry unto
thee in my “field; when I did cry
unto thee in my prayer, and thou
didst hear me.

6 And again, O God, when I did
turn to my house thou didst hear
me in my prayer.

7 And when I did turn unto my
“closet, O Lord, and prayed unto
thee, thou didst hear me.

8 Yea, thou art merciful unto thy
children when they cry unto thee,
to be heard of thee and not of men,
and thou ¢wilt hear them.

9 Yea, O God, thou hast been mer-
ciful unto me, and heard my cries
in the midst of thy congregations.
