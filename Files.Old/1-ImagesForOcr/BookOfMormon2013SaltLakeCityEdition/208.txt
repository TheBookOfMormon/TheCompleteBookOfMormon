brethren; and they were also “ad-
monished, every one by the word
of God, according to his sins, or to
the sins which he had committed,
being commanded of God to pray
without ceasing, and to give ‘thanks
in all things.

CHAPTER 27

Mosiah forbids persecution and enjoins
equality—Alma the younger and the
four sons of Mosiah seek to destroy
the Church—An angel appears and
commands them to cease their evil
course—Alma is struck dumb—All
mankind must be born again to gain
salvation—Alma and the sons of
Mosiah declare glad tidings. About
100-92 B.c.

AND now it came to pass that the
persecutions which were inflicted
on the church by the unbelievers
became so great that the church
began to murmur, and complain
to their leaders concerning the
matter; and they did complain to
Alma. And Alma laid the case be-
fore their king, Mosiah. And Mosiah
“consulted with his priests.

2 And it came to pass that king
Mosiah sent a proclamation through-
out the land round about that there
should not any unbeliever “perse-
cute any of those who belonged to
the church of God.

3 And there was a strict command
throughout all the churches that
there should be no “persecutions
among them, that there should be
an ’equality among all men;

4 That they should let no pride nor
haughtiness disturb their *peace;
that every man should °esteem his

 

“neighbor as himself, “laboring with
their own hands for their support.

5 Yea, and all their priests and
teachers ‘should *labor with their
own hands for their support, in
all cases save it were in sickness,
or in much want; and doing these
things, they did abound in the ‘grace
of God.

6 And there began to be much
peace again in the land; and the
people began to be very numerous,
and began to scatter abroad upon the
face of the earth, yea, on the north
and on the south, on the east and on
the west, building large cities and
villages in all quarters of the land.

7 And the Lord did ¢visit them and
’prosper them, and they became a
large and wealthy people.

8 Now the sons of Mosiah were
numbered among the “unbelievers;
and also one of the sons of Alma was
numbered among them, he being
called Alma, after his father; never-
theless, he became a very wicked
and an *idolatrous man. And he
was a man of many words, and did
speak much ‘flattery to the people;
therefore he “led many of the peo-
ple to do after the manner of his
“iniquities.

9 And he became a great hinder-
ment to the prosperity of the church
of God; “stealing away the hearts of
the people; causing much dissension
among the people; giving a chance
for the enemy of God to exercise
his *power over them.

10 And now it came to pass that
while he was going about to “destroy
the church of God, for he did go
about secretly with the sons of Mo-
siah seeking to destroy the church,
