them, but it is a commandment of
the Lord.

6 Therefore go, my son, and thou
shalt be favored of the Lord, because
thou hast “not *’murmured.

7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,
said unto my father: I ‘will go and
do the things which the Lord hath
commanded, for I know that the
Lord giveth no °commandments
unto the children of men, save he
shall ‘prepare a way for them that
they may accomplish the thing
which he commandeth them.

8 And it came to pass that when
my father had heard these words he
was exceedingly glad, for he knew
that I had been blessed of the Lord.

9 And I, Nephi, and my brethren
took our journey in the wilderness,
with our tents, to go up to the land
of Jerusalem.

10 And it came to pass that when
we had gone up to the land of Je-
rusalem, I and my brethren did
consult one with another.

11 And we “cast lots—who of us
should go in unto the house of Laban.
And it came to pass that the lot fell
upon Laman; and Laman went in
unto the house of Laban, and he
talked with him as he sat in his
house.

12 And he desired of Laban the
records which were engraven upon
the plates of brass, which contained
the “genealogy of my father.

13 And behold, it came to pass
that Laban was angry, and thrust
him out from his presence; and he
would not that he should have the
records. Wherefore, he said unto
him: Behold thou art a robber, and
I will slay thee.

 

14 But Laman fled out of his pres-
ence, and told the things which La-
ban had done, unto us. And we began
to be exceedingly sorrowful, and
my brethren were about to return
unto my father in the wilderness.

15 But behold I said unto them
that: “As the Lord liveth, and as we
live, we will not go down unto our
father in the wilderness until we
have accomplished the thing which
the Lord hath commanded us.

16 Wherefore, let us be faithful
in keeping the commandments of
the Lord; therefore let us go down
to the land of our father’s <inheri-
tance, for behold he left gold and
silver, and all manner of riches.
And all this he hath done because
of the commandments of the Lord.

17 For he knew that Jerusalem
must be “destroyed, because of the
wickedness of the people.

18 For behold, they have “rejected
the words of the prophets. Where-
fore, if my father should dwell in the
land after he hath been *commanded
to flee out of the land, behold, he
would also perish. Wherefore, it
must needs be that he flee out of
the land.

19 And behold, it is wisdom in
God that we should obtain these
“records, that we may preserve
unto our children the language of
our fathers;

20 And also that we may “preserve
unto them the words which have
been spoken by the mouth of all
the holy "prophets, which have
been delivered unto them by the
Spirit and power of God, since the
world began, even down unto this
present time.
