our hearts, that we “provoke not
the Lord our God to pull down his
wrath upon us in these his second
commandments which he has given
unto us; but let us enter into the
’rest of God, which is prepared ac-
cording to his word.

CHAPTER 13

Men are called as high priests because
of their exceeding faith and good works—
They are to teach the commandments—
Through righteousness they are sanctified
and enter into the rest of the Lord—Mel-
chizedek was one of these—Angels are
declaring glad tidings throughout the
land—They will declare the actual com-
ing of Christ. About 82 B.c.

AND again, my brethren, I would
cite your minds forward to the time
when the Lord God gave these com-
mandments unto his children; and
I would that ye should remember
that the Lord God ordained priests,
after his holy order, which was after
the order of his Son, to teach these
things unto the people.

2 And those priests were ordained
after the “order of his Son, in a
bmanner that thereby the people
might know in what manner to look
forward to his Son for redemption.

3 And this is the manner after
which they were ordained—being
“called and "prepared from the
°foundation of the world according
to the ‘foreknowledge of God, on ac-
count of their exceeding faith and
good works; in the first place being
left to ‘choose good or evil; there-
fore they having chosen good, and

 

exercising exceedingly great ‘faith,
are ‘called with a holy calling, yea,
with that holy calling which was
prepared with, and according to, a
preparatory redemption for such.

4 And thus they have been “called
to this holy calling on account of
their faith, while others would re-
ject the Spirit of God on account
of the hardness of their hearts and
’blindness of their minds, while, if
it had not been for this they might
have had as great ‘privilege as their
brethren.

5 Or in fine, in the first place they
were on the “same standing with
their brethren; thus this holy calling
being prepared from the foundation
of the world for such as would not
harden their hearts, being in and
through the atonement of the Only
Begotten Son, who was prepared—

6 And thus being called by this
holy calling, and ordained unto the
high priesthood of the holy order of
God, to teach his commandments
unto the children of men, that they
also might enter into his “rest—

7 This high priesthood being after
the order of his Son, which order was
from the foundation of the world;
or in other words, being “without
beginning of days or end of years,
being prepared from “eternity to
all eternity, according to his ‘fore-
knowledge of all things—

8 Now they were “ordained after
this manner—being called with
a holy calling, and ordained witha
holy ordinance, and taking upon
them the high priesthood of the holy
order, which calling, and ordinance,
