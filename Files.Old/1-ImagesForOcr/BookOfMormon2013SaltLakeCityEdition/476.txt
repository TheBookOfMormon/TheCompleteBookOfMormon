and that they had become exceed-
ingly “rich, because of their pros-
perity in Christ.

24 And now, in this two hundred
and first year there began to be
among them those who were lifted
up in “pride, such as the wearing of
costly apparel, and all manner of
fine pearls, and of the fine things
of the world.

25 And from that time forth they
did have their goods and their sub-
stance no more “common among
them.

26 And they began to be divided
into classes; and they began to build
up “churches unto themselves to get
*gain, and began to deny the true
church of Christ.

27 And it came to pass that when
two hundred and ten years had
passed away there were many
churches in the land; yea, there were
many churches which professed to
know the Christ, and yet they did
@deny the more parts of his gospel,
insomuch that they did receive all
manner of wickedness, and did ad-
minister that which was sacred unto
him to whom it had been forbidden
because of unworthiness.

28 And this church did multiply
exceedingly because of iniquity,
and because of the power of *Satan.
who did get hold upon their “hearts.

29 And again, there was another
church which denied the Christ;
and they did “persecute the true
*church of Christ, because of their
humility and their belief in Christ;
and they did despise them because
of the many miracles which were
wrought among them.

30 Therefore they did exercise
power and authority over the dis-
ciples of Jesus who did tarry with

 

them, and they did cast them into
“prison; but by the power of the
word of God, which was in them,
the prisons were rent in twain, and
they went forth doing mighty mir-
acles among them.

31 Nevertheless, and notwithstand-
ing all these miracles, the people
did harden their hearts, and did
seek to kill them, even as the Jews
at Jerusalem sought to kill Jesus,
according to his word.

32 And they did cast them into
“furnaces of *fire, and they came
forth receiving no harm.

33 And they also cast them into
“dens of wild beasts, and they did
play with the wild beasts even asa
child with a lamb; and they did come
forth from among them, receiving
no harm.

34 Nevertheless, the people did
harden their hearts, for they were
led by many priests and “false
prophets to build up many churches,
and to do all manner of iniquity.
And they did smite upon the peo-
ple of Jesus; but the people of Jesus
did not smite again. And thus they
did dwindle in unbelief and wick-
edness, from year to year, even until
two hundred and thirty years had
passed away.

35 And now it came to pass in this
year, yea, in the two hundred and
thirty and first year, there was a
great division among the people.

36 And it came to pass that in this
year there arose a people who were
called the “Nephites, and they were
true believers in Christ; and among
them there were those who were
called by the Lamanites—Jacobites,
and Josephites, and *Zoramites;

37 Therefore the true believers in.
