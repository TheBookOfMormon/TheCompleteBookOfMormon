THE words of Christ, which he spake
unto his “disciples, the twelve whom
he had chosen, as he laid his hands
upon them—

2 And he called them by name,
saying: Ye shall “call on the Father
in my name, in mighty prayer; and
after ye have done this ye shall have
>power that to him upon whom ye
shall lay your ‘hands, “ye shall give
the Holy Ghost; and in my name
shall ye give it, for thus do mine
apostles.

3 Now Christ spake these words
unto them at the time of his first
appearing; and the multitude heard
it not, but the disciples heard it;
and on as many as they “laid their
hands, fell the Holy Ghost.

CHAPTER 3

Elders ordain priests and teachers
by the laying on of hands. About

THE manner which the disciples,
who were called the “elders of
the church, *ordained ‘priests and
teachers—

2 After they had prayed unto the
Father in the name of Christ, they
“laid their hands upon them, and
said:

3 In the name of Jesus Christ I
ordain you to be a priest (or if he
be a “teacher, I ordain you to be a
teacher) to preach repentance and
‘remission of sins through Jesus
Christ, by the endurance of faith
on his name to the end. Amen.

4 And after this manner did they
«ordain priests and teachers, accord-
ing to the *gifts and callings of God

 

unto men; and they ordained them
by the ‘power of the Holy Ghost,
which was in them.

priests administering the flesh and
blood of Christ unto the church;
and they administered it ‘accord-
ing to the commandments of Christ;
wherefore we know the manner to
be true; and the elder or priest did
minister it—

2 And they did kneel down with
the “church, and pray to the Father
in the name of Christ, saying:

3 O God, the Eternal Father, we
ask thee in the name of thy Son,
Jesus Christ, to bless and “sanctify
this *bread to the souls of all those
who partake of it; that they may
eat in ‘remembrance of the body
of thy Son, and witness unto thee,
O God, the Eternal Father, that
they are willing to take upon them
the ‘name of thy Son, and always
remember him, and keep his com-
mandments which he hath given
them, that they may always have
his ‘Spirit to be with them. Amen.
