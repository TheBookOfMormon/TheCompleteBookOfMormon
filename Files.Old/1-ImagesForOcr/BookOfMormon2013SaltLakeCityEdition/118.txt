25 Wo be unto him that crieth:
All is well!

26 Yea, wo be unto him that “heark-
eneth unto the precepts of men, and
denieth the power of God, and the
gift of the Holy Ghost!

27 Yea, wo be unto him that saith:
We have received, and we “need
no more!

28 And in fine, wo unto all those
who tremble, and are “angry because
of *the truth of God! For behold, he
that is built upon the ‘rock “receiv-
eth it with gladness; and he that
is built upon a sandy foundation
trembleth lest he shall fall.

29 Wo be unto him that shall say:
We have received the word of God,
and we “need *no more of the word
of God, for we have enough!

30 For behold, thus saith the Lord
God: I will give unto the children of
men line upon line, “precept upon
precept, here a little and there a
little; and blessed are those who
hearken unto my precepts, and lend
an ear unto my counsel, for they
shall learn wisdom; for unto him
that ‘receiveth I will give “more; and
from them that shall say, We have
enough, from them shall be taken
away even that which they have.

31 Cursed is he that putteth his
“trust in man, or maketh flesh his
arm, or shall hearken unto the ’pre-
cepts of men, save their precepts
shall be given by the power of the
Holy Ghost.

32 “Wo be unto the Gentiles, saith

they will deny me; nevertheless, I
will be merciful unto them, saith
the Lord God, if they will repent
and "come unto me; for mine ‘arm
is lengthened out all the day long,
saith the Lord God of Hosts.

CHAPTER 29

Many Gentiles will reject the Book of
Mormon—They will say, We need no
more Bible—The Lord speaks to many
nations—He will judge the world out of
the books which will be written. About
559-545 B.C.

But behold, there shall be many—
at that day when I shall proceed to
do a‘marvelous work among them,
that I may remember my ’covenants
which I have made unto the chil-
dren of men, that I may set my hand
again the ‘second time to recover
my people, which are of the house
of Israel;

2 And also, that I may remember
the promises which I have made
unto thee, Nephi, and also unto
thy father, that I would remember
your seed; and that the *words
of your seed should proceed forth
out of my mouth unto your seed;
and my words shall hiss forth
unto the ‘ends of the earth, for a
4standard unto my people, which
are of the house of Israel;

3 And because my words shall hiss
forth—many of the Gentiles shall
say: A “Bible! A Bible! We have
