11 Yea, and how is it that ye have
forgotten what great things the
Lord hath done for us, in “delivering
us out of the hands of Laban, and
also that we should obtain the
record?

12 Yea, and how is it that ye have
forgotten that the Lord is able to
do all ¢things according to his will,
for the children of men, if it so be
that they exercise °faith in him?
Wherefore, let us be faithful to him.

13 And if it so be that we are faith-
ful to him, we shall obtain the “land
of promise; and ye shall know at
some future period that the word of
the Lord shall be fulfilled concern-
ing the ‘destruction of ‘Jerusalem;
for all things which the Lord hath
spoken concerning the destruction
of Jerusalem must be fulfilled.

14 For behold, the “Spirit of the
Lord *ceaseth soon to strive with
them; for behold, they have ‘re-
jected the prophets, and “Jeremiah
have they cast into prison. And they
have sought to take away the ‘life
of my father, insomuch that they
have driven him out of the land.

15 Now behold, I say unto you that
if ye will return unto Jerusalem ye
shall also perish with them. And
now, if ye have choice, go up to
the land, and remember the words
which I speak unto you, that if ye
go ye will also perish; for thus the
Spirit of the Lord constraineth me
that I should speak.

16 And it came to pass that when
I, Nephi, had spoken these words
unto my brethren, they were angry
with me. And it came to pass that
they did lay their hands upon me,
for behold, they were exceedingly
wroth, and they did “bind me with

 

cords, for they sought to take away
my life, that they might leave me
in the wilderness to be devoured
by wild beasts.

17 But it came to pass that I prayed
unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, ac-
cording to my faith which is in thee,
wilt thou deliver me from the hands
of my brethren; yea, even give me
4strength that | may *burst these
bands with which I am bound.

18 And it came to pass that when
I had said these words, behold, the
bands were loosed from off my
hands and feet, and I stood before
my brethren, and I spake unto them
again.

19 And it came to pass that they
were angry with me again, and
sought to lay hands upon me; but
behold, one of the “daughters of
Ishmael, yea, and also her mother,
and one of the sons of Ishmael, did
plead with my brethren, insomuch
that they did soften their hearts;
and they did cease striving to take
away my life.

20 And it came to pass that they
were sorrowful, because of their
wickedness, insomuch that they
did bow down before me, and did
plead with me that I would “forgive
them of the thing that they had
done against me.

21 And it came to pass that I did
frankly “forgive them all that they
had done, and I did exhort them
that they would pray unto the Lord
their God for *forgiveness. And it
came to pass that they did so. And
after they had done praying unto
