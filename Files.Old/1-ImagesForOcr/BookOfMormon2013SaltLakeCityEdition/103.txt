—Babylon (the world) will fall forever—
Compare Isaiah 13. About 559-545 B.c.

“THE burden of Babylon, which
Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

2 Lift ye up a banner upon the
high mountain, exalt the voice unto
them, “shake the hand, that they
may go into the gates of the nobles.

3 [have commanded my sanctified
ones, I have also called my “mighty
ones, for mine anger is not upon
them that rejoice in my highness.

4 The noise of the multitude in
the mountains like as of a great
people, a tumultuous noise of the
“kingdoms of nations ’gathered to-
gether, the Lord of Hosts mustereth
the hosts of the battle.

5 They come from a far country,
from the end of heaven, yea, the
Lord, and the weapons of his indig-
nation, to destroy the whole land.

6 Howl ye, for the ¢day of the Lord
is at hand; it shall come as a de-
struction from the Almighty.

7 Therefore shall all hands be
faint, every man’s heart shall ‘melt;

8 And they shall be afraid; pangs
and sorrows shall take hold of them;
they shall be amazed one at another;
their faces shall be as flames.

9 Behold, the day of the Lord
cometh, cruel both with wrath and
fierce anger, to lay the land deso-
late; and he shall “destroy the sin-
ners thereof out of it.

10 For the “stars of heaven and
the constellations thereof shall not
give their ‘light; the “sun shall be
darkened in his going forth, and

 

the moon shall not cause her light
to shine.

11 And I will ¢punish the world
for evil, and the °wicked for their
iniquity; I will cause the arrogancy
of the ‘proud to cease, and will lay
down the haughtiness of the terrible.

12 I will make a “man more pre-
cious than fine gold; even a man
than the golden wedge of Ophir.

13 Therefore, I will ‘shake the
heavens, and the earth shall *re-
move out of her place, in the wrath
of the Lord of Hosts, and in the day
of his fierce anger.

14 And it shall be as the chased roe,
and as a sheep that no man taketh
up; and they shall every man turn
to his own people, and flee every
one into his own “land.

15 Every one that is proud shall
be thrust through; yea, and every
one that is “joined to the wicked
shall fall by the sword.

16 Their “children also shall be
’dashed to pieces before their eyes;
their houses shall be spoiled and
their wives ravished.

17 Behold, I will stir up the “Medes
against them, which shall not re-
gard silver and gold, nor shall they
delight in it.

18 Their bows shall also dash the
young men to pieces; and they shall
have no “pity on the fruit of the
womb; their eyes shall not spare
children.

19 And “Babylon, the glory of king-
doms, the beauty of the Chaldees’
excellency, shall be as when God
overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
