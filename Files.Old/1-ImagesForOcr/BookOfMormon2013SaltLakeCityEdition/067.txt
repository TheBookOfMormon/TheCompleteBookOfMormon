wherefore, if it should be one body
it must needs remain as dead, having
no life neither death, nor corruption
nor incorruption, happiness nor mis-
ery, neither sense nor insensibility.

12 Wherefore, it must needs have
been created for a thing of naught;
wherefore there would have been
no “purpose in the end of its cre-
ation. Wherefore, this thing must
needs destroy the wisdom of God
and his eternal purposes, and also
the power, and the mercy, and the
’justice of God.

13 And if ye shall say there is ¢no
law, ye shall also say there is no sin.
If ye shall say there is no sin, ye
shall also say there is no righteous-
ness. And if there be no righteousness
there be no happiness. And if there
be no righteousness nor happiness
there be no punishment nor misery.
And if these things are not °there is
no God. And if there is no God we
are not, neither the earth; for there
could have been no creation of
things, neither to act nor to be acted
upon; wherefore, all things must
have vanished away.

14 And now, my sons, I speak unto
you these things for your profit and
“learning; for there is a God, and
he hath °created all things, both
the heavens and the earth, and all
things that in them are, both things
to act and things to be ‘acted upon.

15 And to bring about his eternal

 

“purposes in the end of man, after
he had °created our first parents,
and the beasts of the field and the
‘fowls of the air, and in fine, all
things which are created, it must
needs be that there was an opposi-
tion; even the “forbidden ‘fruit in
fopposition to the “tree of life; the
one being sweet and the other bitter.

16 Wherefore, the Lord God gave
unto man that he should ‘act for
himself. Wherefore, man could not
*act for himself save it should be
that he was ‘enticed by the one or
the other.

17 And I, Lehi, according to the
things which I have read, must needs
suppose that an “angel of God, ac-
cording to that which is written, had
*fallen from heaven; wherefore, he
became a “devil, having sought that
which was evil before God.

18 And because he had fallen from
heaven, and had become miserable
forever, he ¢sought also the misery
of all mankind. Wherefore, he said
unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent,
who is the devil, who is the father
of all *lies, wherefore he said: Par-
take of the forbidden fruit, and ye
shall not die, but ye shall be as God,
“knowing good and evil.

19 And after Adam and Eve had
“partaken of the forbidden fruit
they were driven out of the garden
of *Eden, to till the earth.
