of the people, for they dwell in
righteousness, and the Holy One
of Israel ¢reigneth.

27 And now behold, I, Nephi, say
unto you that all these ‘things must
come according to the flesh.

28 But, behold, all nations, kin-
dreds, tongues, and people shall
dwell safely in the Holy One of Is-
rael if it so be that they will ‘repent.

29 And now I, Nephi, make an end;
for I durst not speak further as yet
concerning these things.

30 Wherefore, my brethren, I

would that ye should consider that
the things which have been written
upon the ‘plates of brass are true;
and they testify that a man must
be obedient to the commandments
of God.

31 Wherefore, ye need not sup-
pose that I and my father are the
only ones that have testified, and
also taught them. Wherefore, if ye
shall be obedient to the “command-
ments, and endure to the end, ye
shall be saved at the last day. And
thus it is. Amen.

THE SECOND BOOK OF NEPHI

An account of the death of Lehi. Nephi’s brethren rebel against him. The Lord
warns Nephi to depart into the wilderness. His journeyings in the wilderness,

and so forth.

CHAPTER 1

Lehi prophesies of a land of liberty—
His seed will be scattered and smitten if
they reject the Holy One of Israel—He
exhorts his sons to put on the armor
of righteousness. About 588-570 B.c.

ND now it came to pass that
after I, Nephi, had made an

end of teaching my brethren,

our “father, Lehi, also spake many
things unto them, and rehearsed
unto them, how great things the
Lord had done for them in bringing
them out of the land of Jerusalem.
2 And he spake unto them con-
cerning their “rebellions upon the
waters, and the mercies of God in

sparing their lives, that they were
not swallowed up in the sea.

3 And he also spake unto them con-
cerning the land of promise, which
they had obtained—how ‘merciful
the Lord had been in warning us
that we should flee out of the land
of Jerusalem.

4 For, behold, said he, I have ¢seen
a *vision, in which I know that
‘Jerusalem is “destroyed; and had we
remained in Jerusalem we should
also have ‘perished.

5 But, said he, notwithstanding
our afflictions, we have obtained
a “land of promise, a land which is
*choice above all other lands; a land
which the Lord God hath ‘covenanted
