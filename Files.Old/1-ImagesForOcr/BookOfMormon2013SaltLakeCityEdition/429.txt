29 Therefore they did combine
against the people of the Lord, and
enter into a covenant to destroy
them, and to deliver those who were
guilty of murder from the grasp of
justice, which was about to be ad-
ministered according to the law.

30 And they did set at defiance the
law and the rights of their country;
and they did covenant one with an-
other to destroy the governor, and
to establish a “king over the land,
that the land should no more be
at ‘liberty but should be subject
unto kings.

CHAPTER 7

The chief judge is murdered, the gov-
ernment is destroyed, and the people
divide into tribes—Jacob, an anti-
Christ, becomes king of a secret com-
bination—Nephi preaches repentance
and faith in Christ—Angels minister
to him daily, and he raises his brother
from the dead—Many repent and are
baptized. About A.D. 30-33.

Now behold, I will show unto you
that they did not establish a king
over the land; but in this same year,
yea, the thirtieth year, they did
destroy upon the judgment-seat,
yea, did murder the chief judge of
the land.

2 And the people were divided one
against another; and they did “sepa-
rate one from another into tribes,
every man according to his family
and his kindred and friends; and
thus they did destroy the govern-
ment of the land.

3 And every tribe did appoint a
chief or a leader over them; and
thus they became tribes and lead-
ers of tribes.

4 Now behold, there was no man
among them save he had much fam-
ily and many kindreds and friends;
therefore their tribes became ex-
ceedingly great.

 

5 Now all this was done, and there
were no wars as yet among them;
and all this iniquity had come upon
the people “because they did *yield
themselves unto the power of Satan.

6 And the regulations of the gov-
ernment were destroyed, because
of the “secret combination of the
friends and kindreds of those who
murdered the prophets.

7 And they did cause a great con-
tention in the land, insomuch that
the more righteous part of the peo-
ple had nearly all become wicked;
yea, there were but few righteous
men among them.

8 And thus six years had not passed
away since the more part of the
people had turned from their righ-
teousness, like the dog to his “vomit,
or like the sow to her wallowing
in the mire.

9 Now this secret combination,
which had brought so great iniq-
uity upon the people, did gather
themselves together, and did place
at their head a man whom they did
call Jacob;

10 And they did call him their
king; therefore he became a king
over this wicked band; and he was
one of the chiefest who had given
his voice against the prophets who
testified of Jesus.

11 And it came to pass that they
were not so strong in number as
the tribes of the people, who were
united together save it were their
leaders did establish their laws,
every one according to his tribe;
nevertheless they were enemies; not-
withstanding they were not a righ-
teous people, yet they were united
in the hatred of those who had en-
tered into a covenant to “destroy the
government.

12 Therefore, Jacob seeing that
their enemies were more numerous
than they, he being the king of the
band, therefore he commanded his
