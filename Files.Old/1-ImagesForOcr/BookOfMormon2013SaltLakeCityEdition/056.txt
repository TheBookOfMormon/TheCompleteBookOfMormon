to pass I “showed them thee; and
I showed them for fear lest thou
shouldst say—Mine idol hath done
them, and my graven image, and
my molten image hath commanded
them.

6 Thou hast seen and heard all this;
and will ye “not declare them? And
that I have showed thee new things
from this time, even hidden things,
and thou didst not know them.

7 They are created now, and not
from the beginning, even before
the day when thou heardest them
not they were declared unto thee,
lest thou shouldst say—Behold I
knew them.

8 Yea, and thou heardest not; yea,
thou knewest not; yea, from that
time thine ear was not opened; for
I knew that thou wouldst deal very
treacherously, and wast called a
“transgressor from the womb.

9 Nevertheless, for my “name’s
sake will I defer mine anger, and
for my praise will I refrain from
thee, that I cut thee not off.

10 For, behold, I have refined thee,
I have chosen thee in the furnace
of “affliction.

11 For mine own sake, yea, for
mine own sake will I do this, for I
will not suffer my “name to be pol-

The Lord hath loved him; yea, and
he will “fulfil his word which he
hath declared by them; and he
will do his pleasure on *Babylon,
and his arm shall come upon the
Chaldeans.

15 Also, saith the Lord; I the Lord,
yea, I have spoken; yea, I have called
“him to declare, | have brought
him, and he shall make his way
prosperous.

16 Come ye near unto me; I have
not spoken in “secret; from the
beginning, from the time that it
was declared have I spoken; and
the Lord God, and his Spirit, hath
sent me.

17 And thus saith the Lord, thy
«Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel;
I have sent him, the Lord thy God
who teacheth thee to profit, who
*leadeth thee by the way thou
shouldst go, hath done it.

18 O that thou hadst hearkened to
my “commandments—then had thy
bpeace been as a river, and thy righ-
teousness as the waves of the sea.

19 Thy “seed also had been as the
sand; the offspring of thy bowels
like the gravel thereof; his name
should not have been cut off nor

20 “Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye
from the *Chaldeans, with a voice
of singing declare ye, tell this, utter
