CHAPTER 6

The righteous Lamanites preach to the
wicked Nephites—Both peoples prosper
during an era of peace and plenty—
Lucifer, the author of sin, stirs up the
hearts of the wicked and the Gadianton
robbers in murder and wickedness—The
robbers take over the Nephite govern-
ment. About 29-23 B.c.

AND it came to pass that when the
sixty and second year of the reign
of the judges had ended, all these
things had happened and the La-
manites had become, the more part
of them, a righteous people, inso-
much that their “righteousness did
exceed that of the Nephites, because
of their firmness and their steadi-
ness in the faith.

2 For behold, there were many of
the Nephites who had become “hard-
ened and impenitent and grossly
wicked, insomuch that they did
reject the word of God and all the
preaching and prophesying which
did come among them.

3 Nevertheless, the people of the
church did have great joy because
of the conversion of the Laman-
ites, yea, because of the church of
God, which had been established
among them. And they did “fellow-
ship one with another, and did re-
joice one with another, and did have
great joy.

4 And it came to pass that many
of the Lamanites did come down
into the land of Zarahemla, and
did declare unto the people of the
Nephites the manner of their “con-
version, and did exhort them to
faith and repentance.

5 Yea, and many did “preach with
exceedingly great power and author-
ity, unto the bringing down many

 

of them into the depths of humil-
ity, to be the humble followers of
God and the Lamb.

6 And it came to pass that many of
the Lamanites did go into the land
northward; and also “Nephi and
’Lehi went into the ‘land northward,
to preach unto the people. And thus
ended the sixty and third year.

7 And behold, there was peace in
all the land, insomuch that the Neph-
ites did go into whatsoever part of
the land they would, whether among
the Nephites or the Lamanites.

8 And it came to pass that the La-
manites did also go whithersoever
they would, whether it were among
the Lamanites or among the Neph-
ites; and thus they did have free
intercourse one with another, to
“buy and to sell, and to get gain,
according to their desire.

9 And it came to pass that they
became exceedingly rich, both the
Lamanites and the Nephites; and
they did have an exceeding plenty
of “gold, and of silver, and of all
manner of precious metals, both in
the land south and in the land north.

10 Now the land south was called
«Lehi, and the land north was called
’Mulek, which was after the ‘son of
Zedekiah; for the Lord did bring
Mulek into the land north, and Lehi
into the land south.

11 And behold, there was all man-
ner of gold in both these lands, and
of silver, and of precious ore of ev-
ery kind; and there were also cu-
rious workmen, who did “work all
kinds of ore and did refine it; and
thus they did become rich.

12 They did raise grain in abun-
dance, both in the north and in the
south; and they did flourish exceed-
ingly, both in the north and in the
