22 Therefore, if ye do these things
blessed are ye, for ye shall be lifted
up at the last day.

23 “Write the things which ye have
seen and heard, save it be those
which are ’forbidden.

24 Write the works of this people,
which shall be, even as hath been
written, of that which hath been.

25 For behold, out of the books
which have been written, and which
shall be written, shall this people
be “judged, for by them shall their
*works be known unto men.

26 And behold, all things are ¢writ-
ten by the Father; therefore out of
the books which shall be written
shall the world be judged.

27 And know ye that “ye shall be
*judges of this people, according
to the judgment which I shall give
unto you, which shall be just. There-
fore, what ‘manner of men ought ye
to be? Verily I say unto you, even
4as lam.

28 And now | 2go unto the Father.
And verily I say unto you, whatso-
ever things ye shall ask the Father
in my name shall be given unto you.

29 Therefore, “ask, and ye shall re-
ceive; knock, and it shall be opened
unto you; for he that asketh, receiv-
eth; and unto him that knocketh,
it shall be opened.

30 And now, behold, my joy is
great, even unto fulness, because of
you, and also this generation; yea,
and even the Father rejoiceth, and
also all the holy angels, because of
you and this generation; for “none

31 Behold, I would that ye should

and none of them are lost; and in
them I have fulness of ‘joy.

32 But behold, it “sorroweth me

led away captive by him even as
was the ‘son of perdition; for they
will sell me for silver and for gold,
and for that which ‘moth doth cor-
rupt and which thieves can break
through and steal. And in that day
will I visit them, even in turning
their works upon their own heads.

33 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had ended these sayings he
said unto his disciples: Enter ye in at
the “strait gate; for strait is the gate,
and narrow is the way that leads
to life, and few there be that find
it; but wide is the gate, and broad

CHAPTER 28

Nine of the twelve disciples desire and
are promised an inheritance in Christ’s
kingdom when they die—The Three
Nephites desire and are given power over
