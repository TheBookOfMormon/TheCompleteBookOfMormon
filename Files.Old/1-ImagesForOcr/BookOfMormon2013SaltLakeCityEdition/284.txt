cheeks; and we have been stoned,
and taken and bound with ‘strong
cords, and cast into prison; and
through the power and wisdom of
God we have been delivered again.

30 And we have suffered all manner
of afflictions, and all this, that per-
haps we might be the means of sav-
ing some soul; and we supposed that
our “joy would be full if perhaps we
could be the means of saving some.

31 Now behold, we can look forth
and see the “fruits of our labors; and
are they few? I say unto you, Nay,
they are 'many; yea, and we can
witness of their sincerity, because
of their love towards their brethren
and also towards us.

32 For behold, they had rather
“sacrifice their lives than even to
take the life of their enemy; and
they have *buried their weapons of
war deep in the earth, because of
their love towards their brethren.

33 And now behold I say unto you,
has there been so great love in all
the land? Behold, I say unto you,
Nay, there has not, even among the
Nephites.

34 For behold, they would take
up arms against their brethren;
they would not suffer themselves
to be slain. But behold how “many
of these have laid down their lives;
and we know that they have gone
to their God, because of their love
and of their hatred to sin.

35 Now have we not reason to
rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there
never were men that had so great
reason to rejoice as we, since the
world began; yea, and my joy is
carried away, even unto boasting
in my God; for he has all “power,
ball wisdom, and all understanding;
he comprehendeth all things, and

 

he is a ‘merciful Being, even unto
salvation, to those who will repent
and believe on his name.

36 Now if this is “boasting, even so
will I boast; for this is my life and
my light, my joy and my salvation,
and my redemption from everlast-
ing wo. Yea, blessed is the name
of my God, who has been mindful of
this people, who are a *branch of the
tree of Israel, and has been ‘lost
from its body in a strange land; yea,
I say, blessed be the name of my
God, who has been mindful of us,
4wanderers in a strange land.

37 Now my brethren, we see that
God is “mindful of every *people,
whatsoever land they may be in;
yea, he numbereth his people, and
his bowels of mercy are over all the
earth. Now this is my joy, and my
great thanksgiving; yea, and I will
give thanks unto my God forever.
Amen.

CHAPTER 27
The Lord commands Ammon to lead
the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi to safety—
Upon meeting Alma, Ammon’s joy
exhausts his strength—The Nephites
give the Anti-Nephi-Lehies the land of
Jershon—They are called the people of
Ammon. About 90-77 B.c.

Now it came to pass that when
those Lamanites who had gone
to war against the Nephites had
found, after their “many struggles
to destroy them, that it was in vain
to seek their destruction, they re-
turned again to the land of Nephi.

2 And it came to pass that the
Amalekites, because of their loss,
were exceedingly angry. And when
they saw that they could not seek
revenge from the Nephites, they be-
gan to “stir up the people in anger
