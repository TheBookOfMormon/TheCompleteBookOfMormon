of their works, whether they be good
or whether they be evil—

5 If they be good, to the ¢resur-
rection of everlasting life; and if
they be evil, to the resurrection of
damnation; being on a parallel, the
one on the one hand and the other
on the other hand, according to the
mercy, and the *justice, and the ho-
liness which is in Christ, who was
“before the world began.

6 And now there cannot be writ-
ten in this book even a “hundredth
part of the things which Jesus did
truly teach unto the people;

7 But behold the “plates of Nephi
do contain the more part of the
things which he taught the people.

8 And these things have I writ-
ten, which are a “lesser part of the
things which he taught the people;
and I have written them to the in-
tent that they may be brought again
unto this people, *from the Gentiles,
according to the words which Jesus
hath spoken.

9 And when they shall have re-
ceived this, which is expedient that
they should have first, to try their
faith, and if it shall so be that they
shall believe these things then shall
the “greater things be made mani-
fest unto them.

10 And if it so be that they will not
believe these things, then shall the
“greater things be withheld from
them, unto their condemnation.

11 Behold, I was about to write
them, all which were engraven
upon the plates of Nephi, but the
Lord “forbade it, saying: I will *try
the faith of my people.

 

12 Therefore I, “Mormon, do
write the things which have been
commanded me of the Lord. And
now I, "Mormon, make an end of
my sayings, and proceed to write
the things which have been com-
manded me.

13 Therefore, I would that ye
should behold that the Lord truly
did teach the people, for the space
of three days; and after that he did
“show himself unto them oft, and
did break "bread oft, and bless it,
and give it unto them.

14 And it came to pass that he did
teach and minister unto the “chil-
dren of the multitude of whom
hath been spoken, and he did °loose
their ‘tongues, and they did speak
unto their fathers great and mar-
velous things, even greater than he
had revealed unto the people; and
he loosed their tongues that they
could utter.

15 And it came to pass that after
he had ascended into heaven—the
second time that he showed him-
self unto them, and had gone unto
the Father, after having “healed
all their sick, and their lame, and
opened the eyes of their blind
and unstopped the ears of the deaf,
and even had done all manner of
cures among them, and raised a
man from the *dead, and had shown
forth his power unto them, and had
ascended unto the Father—

16 Behold, it came to pass on the
morrow that the multitude gathered
themselves together, and they both
saw and heard these children; yea,
even “babes did open their mouths
