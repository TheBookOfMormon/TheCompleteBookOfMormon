witness against them, that they
might deliver them to their judges
that they might be judged accord-
ing to the law, and that they might
be slain or cast into prison, accord-
ing to the crime which they could
make appear or witness against
them.

14 Now it was those men who
sought to destroy them, who were
“lawyers, who were hired or ap-
pointed by the people to adminis-
ter the law at their times of trials,
or at the trials of the crimes of the
people before the judges.

15 Now these lawyers were learned
in all the arts and “cunning of the
people; and this was to enable them
that they might be skilful in their
profession.

16 And it came to pass that they
began to question Amulek, that
thereby they might make him “cross
his words, or contradict the words
which he should speak.

17 Now they knew not that Amu-
lek could “know of their designs.
But it came to pass as they began
to question him, he *perceived their
thoughts, and he said unto them: O
ye wicked and perverse ‘generation,
ye lawyers and hypocrites, for ye
are laying the foundations of the
devil; for ye are laying “traps and
snares to catch the holy ones of God.

18 Ye are laying plans to “pervert
the ways of the righteous, and to
bring down the wrath of God upon
your heads, even to the utter de-
struction of this people.

19 Yea, well did Mosiah say, who
was our last king, when he was about
to deliver up the kingdom, having
no one to confer it upon, causing
that this people should be governed

 

by their own voices—yea, well did
he say that if the time should come
that the voice of this people should
“choose iniquity, that is, if the time
should come that this people should
fall into transgression, they would
be ripe for destruction.

20 And now I say unto you that
well doth the Lord «judge of your
iniquities; well doth he cry unto this
people, by the voice of his ’angels:
Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom
of heaven is at hand.

21 Yea, well doth he cry, by the
voice of his angels that: ¢I will come
down among my people, with equity
and justice in my hands.

22 Yea, and I say unto you that if
it were not for the “prayers of the
righteous, who are now in the land,
that ye would even now be visited
with utter destruction; yet it would
not be by °flood, as were the people
in the days of ‘Noah, but it would
be by famine, and by pestilence,
and the ‘sword.

23 But it is by the “prayers of the
righteous that ye are spared; now
therefore, if ye will cast out the
righteous from among you then will
not the Lord stay his hand; but in
his fierce anger he will come out
against you; then ye shall be smit-
ten by famine, and by pestilence,
and by the sword; and the ‘time is
soon at hand except ye repent.

24 And now it came to pass that
the people were more angry with
Amulek, and they cried out, saying:
This man doth revile against our
laws which are just, and our wise
“lawyers whom we have selected.

25 But Amulek stretched forth
his hand, and cried the mightier
unto them, saying: O ye wicked and
