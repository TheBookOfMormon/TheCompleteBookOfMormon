42 For ye shall ‘not go out with
’haste nor go by flight; for the Lord
will go before you, and the God of
Israel shall be your rearward.

43 Behold, my servant shall deal
prudently; he shall be exalted and
extolled and be very high.

44 As many were astonished at
thee—his visage was so marred,
more than any man, and his form
more than the sons of men—

45 So shall he “sprinkle many
nations; the kings shall shut their
mouths at him, for that which had
not been told them shall they see;
and that which they had not heard
shall they °consider.

46 Verily, verily, | say unto you, all
these things shall surely come, even
as the Father hath commanded me.
Then shall this covenant which the
Father hath covenanted with his
people be fulfilled; and then shall
“Jerusalem be inhabited again with
my people, and it shall be the land
of their inheritance.

CHAPTER 21

Israel will be gathered when the Book
of Mormon comes forth—The Gentiles
will be established as a free people in
America—They will be saved if they
believe and obey; otherwise, they will
be cut off and destroyed—Israel will
build the New Jerusalem, and the lost
tribes will return. About A.D. 34.

Ghost which shall be given unto you

know concerning this people who
are a remnant of the house of Jacob,
and concerning this my people who
shall be scattered by them;

3 Verily, verily, lsay unto you, when

come forth of the Father, *from
them unto you;

4 For it is wisdom in the Father
that they should be established in
this land, and be set up as a “free
people by the power of the Father,
that these things might come forth
from them unto a remnant of your
seed, that the "covenant of the
Father may be fulfilled which he
hath covenanted with his people,
O house of Israel;

5 Therefore, when these works and
the works which shall be wrought
among you hereafter shall come
forth “from the Gentiles, unto your
*seed which shall dwindle in unbe-
lief because of iniquity;

6 For thus it behooveth the Father
