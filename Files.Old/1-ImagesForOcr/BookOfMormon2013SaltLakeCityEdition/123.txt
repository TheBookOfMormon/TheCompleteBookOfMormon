of Christ, by /baptism—yea, by fol-
lowing your Lord and your Savior
down into the water, according to his
word, behold, then shall ye receive
the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh
the ‘baptism of fire and of the Holy
Ghost; and then can ye speak with
the 'tongue of angels, and shout
praises unto the Holy One of Israel.

14 But, behold, my beloved breth-
ren, thus came the voice of the Son
unto me, saying: After ye have re-
pented of your sins, and witnessed
unto the Father that ye are willing
to keep my commandments, by the
baptism of water, and have received
the baptism of fire and of the Holy
Ghost, and can speak with a new
tongue, yea, even with the tongue of
angels, and after this should “deny
me, it would have been better for
you that ye had not known me.

15 And I heard a voice from the
Father, saying: Yea, the “words of
my Beloved are true and faithful.
He that *endureth to the ‘end, the
same shall be saved.

16 And now, my beloved brethren,
I know by this that unless a man
shall “endure to the end, in follow-
ing the *example of the Son of the
living God, he cannot be saved.

17 Wherefore, do the things which
Ihave told you I have seen that your
Lord and your Redeemer should do;
for, for this cause have they been
shown unto me, that ye might know

 

 

the gate by which ye should enter.
For the gate by which ye should
enter is repentance and “baptism
by water; and then cometh a ¢re-
mission of your sins by fire and by
the Holy Ghost.

18 And then are ye in this “strait
and narrow ’path which leads to
eternal life; yea, ye have entered in
by the gate; ye have done according
to the commandments of the Father
and the Son; and ye have received
the Holy Ghost, which ‘witnesses of
the ‘Father and the Son, unto the
fulfilling of the promise which he
hath made, that if ye entered in by
the way ye should receive.

19 And now, my beloved brethren,
after ye have gotten into this strait
and narrow “path, I would ask if all
is "done? Behold, I say unto you,
Nay; for ye have not come thus far
Save it were by the word of Christ
with unshaken ‘faith in him, ‘rely-
ing wholly upon the merits of him
who is mighty to ‘save.

20 Wherefore, ye must press for-
ward with a “steadfastness in Christ,
having a perfect brightness of
*hope, and a ‘love of God and of all
men. Wherefore, if ye shall press
forward, feasting upon the word
of Christ, and ‘endure to the end,
behold, thus saith the Father: Ye
shall have ‘eternal life.

21 And now, behold, my beloved
brethren, this is the ‘way; and there
