wherefore, they may be “likened
unto you, for ye are of the house of
Israel. And there are many things
which have been spoken by Isaiah
which may be likened unto you, be-
cause ye are of the house of Israel.

6 And now, these are the words:
*Thus saith the Lord God: Behold,
I will lift up mine hand to the
Gentiles, and set up my ’standard
to the people; and they shall bring
thy sons in their arms, and thy
daughters shall be carried upon their
shoulders.

7 And “kings shall be thy nursing
fathers, and their queens thy nurs-
ing mothers; they shall bow down
to thee with their faces towards the
earth, and lick up the dust of thy
feet; and thou shalt know that *L
am the Lord; for they shall not be
ashamed that ‘wait for me.

8 And now I, Jacob, would speak
somewhat concerning these words.
For behold, the Lord has shown me
that those who were at “Jerusalem,
from whence we came, have been
’slain and ‘carried away captive.

9 Nevertheless, the Lord has shown.
unto me that they should “return
again. And he also has shown unto
me that the Lord God, the Holy One
of Israel, should manifest himself
unto them in the flesh; and after
he should manifest himself they
should *’scourge him and ‘crucify
him, according to the words of the
angel who spake it unto me.

 

10 And after they have “hardened
their hearts and ’stiffened their
necks against the Holy One of Israel,
behold, the ‘judgments of the Holy
One of Israel shall come upon them.
And the day cometh that they shall
be smitten and afflicted.

11 Wherefore, after they are driven
to and fro, for thus saith the angel,
many shall be afflicted in the flesh,
and shall not be suffered to “per-
ish, because of the prayers of the
faithful; they shall be scattered, and
smitten, and hated; nevertheless, the
Lord will be merciful unto them,
that "when they shall come to the
“knowledge of their Redeemer, they
shall be “gathered together again
to the ‘lands of their inheritance.

12 And blessed are the ¢Gentiles,
they of whom the prophet has writ-
ten; for behold, if it so be that they
shall repent and fight not against
Zion, and do not unite themselves to
that great and abominable church,
they shall be saved; for the Lord God
will fulfil his ‘covenants which he
has made unto his children; and for
this cause the prophet has written
these things.

13 Wherefore, they that fight
against Zion and the covenant peo-
ple of the Lord shall lick up the
dust of their feet; and the people
of the Lord shall not be “ashamed.
For the people of the Lord are they
who ‘wait for him; for they still
wait for the coming of the Messiah.
