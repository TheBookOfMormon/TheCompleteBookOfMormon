of the field, which is run over by
the beasts and trodden under foot.

12 And again, he saith thou shalt
be as the blossoms of a thistle,
which, when it is fully ripe, if the
wind bloweth, it is driven forth
upon the face of the land. And he
pretendeth the Lord hath spoken
it. And he saith all this shall come
upon thee except thou repent, and
this because of thine iniquities.

13 And now, O king, what great
evil hast thou done, or what great
sins have thy people committed,
that we should be “condemned of
God or judged of this man?

14 And now, O king, behold, we
are “guiltless, and thou, O king, hast
not sinned; therefore, this man has
‘lied concerning you, and he has
prophesied in vain.

15 And behold, we are strong, we
shall not come into bondage, or be
taken captive by our enemies; yea,
and thou hast prospered in the
land, and thou shalt also prosper.

16 Behold, here is the man, we de-
liver him into thy hands; thou mayest
do with him as seemeth thee good.

17 And it came to pass that king
Noah caused that Abinadi should
be cast into prison; and he com-
manded that the “priests should
gather themselves together that
he might hold a council with them
what he should do with him.

18 And it came to pass that they
said unto the king: Bring him hither
that we may question him; and the
king commanded that he should be
brought before them.

19 And they began to question
him, that they might cross him, that
thereby they might have wherewith
to “accuse him; but he answered
them boldly, and withstood all their
questions, yea, to their astonish-

 

ment; for he did *withstand them
in all their questions, and did
confound them in all their words.

20 And it came to pass that one of
them said unto him: “What meaneth
the words which are written, and
which have been taught by our
fathers, saying:

21 “How beautiful upon the moun-
tains are the feet of him °that
bringeth good tidings; that pub-
lisheth peace; that bringeth good

salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy
God reigneth;

22 “Thy watchmen shall lift up
the voice; with the voice together
shall they sing; for they shall see
eye to eye when the Lord shall bring
again Zion;

23 Break forth into joy; sing to-
gether ye waste places of Jerusalem;
for the Lord hath comforted his peo-
ple, he hath redeemed Jerusalem;

24 The Lord hath made bare his
holy arm in the eyes of all the na-
tions, and all the ends of the earth
shall see the salvation of our God?

25 And now Abinadi said unto
them: Are you “priests, and pretend
to teach this people, and to under-
stand the spirit of prophesying, and
yet desire to know of me what these
things mean?

26 [say unto you, wo be unto you
for perverting the ways of the Lord!
For if ye understand these things
ye have not taught them; there-

of the Lord.

27 Ye have not applied your “hearts
