is because of their iniquity that
they know not of you.

20 And verily, I say unto you again
that the other tribes hath the Father
separated from them; and it is be-
cause of their iniquity that they
know not of them.

21 And verily I say unto you, that
ye are they of whom I said: “Other
sheep I have which are not of this
fold; them also I must bring, and
they shall hear my voice; and there
shall be one fold, and one ’shepherd.

22 And they understood me not,
for they supposed it had been the
“Gentiles; for they understood not
that the Gentiles should be *con-
verted through their preaching.

23 And they understood me not
that I said they shall hear my voice;
and they understood me not that
the “Gentiles should not at any time
hear my voice—that I should not
manifest myself unto them save it
were by the Holy Ghost.

24 But behold, ye have both heard
“my voice, and seen me; and ye are
my sheep, and ye are numbered
among those whom the Father hath
’given me.

CHAPTER 16

Jesus will visit others of the lost sheep
of Israel—In the latter days the gospel
will go to the Gentiles and then to the
house of Istael—The Lord’s people will
see eye to eye when He brings again
Zion. About A.D. 34.

AND verily, verily, | say unto you
that I have “other sheep, which are
not of this land, neither of the land

 

of Jerusalem, neither in any parts
of that land round about whither
I have been to minister.

2 For they of whom I speak are
they who have not as yet heard my
voice; neither have I at any time
manifested myself unto them.

3 But I have received a “command-
ment of the Father that I shall go
unto them, and that they shall *hear
my voice, and shall be numbered
among my sheep, that there may be
one fold and one shepherd; there-
fore | go to show myself unto them.

4 And I command you that ye shall
“write these sayings after lam gone,
that if it so be that my people at
Jerusalem, they who have seen me
and been with me in my ministry,
do not ask the Father in my name,
that they may receive a knowledge
of you by the Holy Ghost, and also
of the other tribes whom they know
not of, that these sayings which ye
shall write shall be kept and shall
be manifested unto the Gentiles,
that through the fulness of the Gen-
tiles, the remnant of their seed, who
shall be scattered forth upon the
face of the earth because of their
‘unbelief, may be brought in, or
may be brought to a “knowledge
of me, their Redeemer.

5 And then will 1 ¢gather them in
from the four quarters of the earth;
and then will I fulfil the *covenant
which the Father hath made unto
all the people of the ‘house of Israel.

6 And blessed are the “Gentiles,
because of their belief in me, inand
of the Holy Ghost, which *witnesses
unto them of me and of the Father.
