and they persecute the meek and
the poor in heart, because in their
‘pride they are puffed up.

14 They wear “stiff necks and high
heads; yea, and because of pride,
and wickedness, and abominations,
and *whoredoms, they have all
“gone astray save it be a “few, who
are the humble followers of Christ;
nevertheless, they are ‘led, that in
many instances they do/err because
they are taught by the precepts
of men.

15 O the ¢wise, and the learned,
and the rich, that are puffed up in
the *pride of their ‘hearts, and all
those who preach “false doctrines,
and all those who commit ‘whore-
doms, and pervert the right way of
the Lord, ‘wo, wo, wo be unto them,
saith the Lord God Almighty, for
they shall be thrust down to hell!

16 Wo unto them that “turn aside
the just for a thing of naught and
brevile against that which is good,
and say that it is of no worth! For
the day shall come that the Lord
God will speedily visit the inhabi-
tants of the earth; and in that day
that they are ‘fully ripe in iniquity
they shall perish.

17 But behold, if the inhabitants
of the earth shall repent of their
wickedness and abominations they
shall not be destroyed, saith the
Lord of Hosts.

18 But behold, that great and
“abominable church, the "whore
of all the earth, must ‘tumble to

 

the earth, and great must be the
fall thereof.

19 For the kingdom of the devil
must “shake, and they which belong
to it must needs be stirred up unto
repentance, or the *devil will grasp
them with his everlasting ‘chains,
and they be stirred up to anger,
and perish;

20 For behold, at that day shall he
“rage in the °hearts of the children
of men, and stir them up to anger
against that which is good.

21 And others will he ‘pacify, and
lull them away into carnal °secu-
rity, that they will say: All is well
in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is
well—and thus the ‘devil ‘cheateth
their souls, and leadeth them away
carefully down to hell.

22 And behold, others he “flattereth
away, and telleth them there is no
*hell; and he saith unto them: Iam
no devil, for there is none—and thus
he whispereth in their ears, until he
grasps them with his awful ‘chains,
from whence there is no deliverance.

23 Yea, they are grasped with
death, and hell; and death, and
hell, and the devil, and all that
have been seized therewith must
stand before the throne of God,
and be “judged according to their
works, from whence they must go
into the place prepared for them,
even a *lake of fire and brimstone,
which is endless torment.

24 Therefore, wo be unto him that
is at “ease in Zion!
