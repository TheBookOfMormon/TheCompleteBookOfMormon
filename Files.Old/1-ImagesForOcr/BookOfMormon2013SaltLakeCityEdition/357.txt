had, by their labors, fortified the
city Morianton until it had become
an exceeding stronghold.

34 And they were continually
bringing new forces into that city,
and also new supplies of provisions.

35 And thus ended the twenty and
ninth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi.

CHAPTER 56

Helaman sends an epistle to Moroni,
recounting the state of the war with
the Lamanites—Antipus and Helaman
gain a great victory over the Laman-
ites—Helaman’s two thousand stripling
sons fight with miraculous power, and
none of them are slain. Verse 1, about
62 B.C.; verses 2-19, about 66 B.C.; and
verses 20-57, about 65-64 B.C.

AND now it came to pass in the
commencement of the thirtieth
year of the reign of the judges, on
the second day in the first month,
«Moroni received an ’epistle from
Helaman, stating the affairs of the
people in ‘that quarter of the land.

2 And these are the words which
he wrote, saying: My dearly beloved
brother, Moroni, as well in the Lord
as in the tribulations of our war-
fare; behold, my beloved brother,
I have somewhat to tell you con-
cerning our warfare in this part of
the land.

3 Behold, “two thousand of the sons
of those men whom Ammon brought
down out of the land of Nephi—now
ye have known that these were de-
scendants of Laman, who was the
eldest son of our father Lehi;

4 Now I need not rehearse unto
you concerning their traditions or
their unbelief, for thou knowest
concerning all these things—

5 Therefore it sufficeth me that
I tell you that two thousand of
these young men have taken their

 

weapons of war, and would that I
should be their leader; and we have
come forth to defend our country.

6 And now ye also know con-
cerning the “covenant which their
fathers made, that they would not
take up their weapons of war against
their brethren to shed blood.

7 But in the twenty and sixth year,
when they saw our afflictions and
our tribulations for them, they were
about to “break the covenant which
they had made and take up their
weapons of war in our defence.

8 But I would not suffer them that
they should break this “covenant
which they had made, supposing
that God would strengthen us, in-
somuch that we should not suffer
more because of the fulfilling the
’oath which they had taken.

9 But behold, here is one thing in
which we may have great joy. For
behold, in the twenty and sixth
year, I, Helaman, did march at the
head of these ¢two thousand young
men to the city of *Judea, to assist
Antipus, whom ye had appointed a
leader over the people of that part
of the land.

10 And I did join my two thou-
sand “sons, (for they are worthy to
be called sons) to the army of An-
tipus, in which strength Antipus
did rejoice exceedingly; for behold,
his army had been reduced by the
Lamanites because their forces had
slain a vast number of our men,
for which cause we have to mourn.

11 Nevertheless, we may console
ourselves in this point, that they
have died in the cause of their
country and of their God, yea, and
they are “happy.

12 And the Lamanites had also re-
tained many prisoners, all of whom
are chief ‘captains, for none other
have they spared alive. And we
suppose that they are now at this
