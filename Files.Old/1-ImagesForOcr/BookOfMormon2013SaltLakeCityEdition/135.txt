BEHOLD, my brethren, do ye not re-
member to have read the words of
the prophet “Zenos, which he spake
unto the house of Israel, saying:

2 Hearken, O ye house of Israel,
and hear the words of me, a prophet
of the Lord.

3 For behold, thus saith the Lord,
Iwill liken thee, O house of “Israel,
like unto a tame “olive tree, which
a man took and nourished in his
‘vineyard; and it grew, and waxed
old, and began to “decay.

4 And it came to pass that the mas-
ter of the vineyard went forth, and
he saw that his olive tree began to
decay; and he said: I will “prune
it, and dig about it, and nourish
it, that perhaps it may shoot forth
young and tender branches, and it
perish not.

5 And it came to pass that he
“pruned it, and digged about it, and
nourished it according to his word.

6 And it came to pass that after
many days it began to put forth
somewhat a little, young and tender
branches; but behold, the main “top
thereof began to perish.

7 And it came to pass that the mas-
ter of the vineyard saw it, and he
said unto his “servant: It grieveth me
that I should lose this tree; where-
fore, go and pluck the branches from.
a wild olive tree, and bring them
hither unto me; and we will pluck
off those main branches which are
beginning to wither away, and we
will cast them into the fire that
they may be burned.

8 And behold, saith the Lord of
the vineyard, I take “away many of
these young and tender branches,
and I will graft them °whitherso-
ever I will; and it mattereth not that

 

if it so be that the root of this tree
will perish, I may preserve the fruit
thereof unto myself; wherefore, I
will take these young and tender
branches, and I will graft them
whithersoever I will.

9 Take thou the branches of the
wild olive tree, and graft them in, in
the “stead thereof; and these which
I have plucked off I will cast into
the fire and burn them, that they
may not cumber the ground of my
vineyard.

10 And it came to pass that the
servant of the Lord of the vine-
yard did according to the word
of the Lord of the vineyard, and
grafted in the branches of the ¢wild
olive tree.

11 And the Lord of the vineyard
caused that it should be digged
about, and pruned, and nourished,
saying unto his servant: It grieveth
me that I should lose this tree; where-
fore, that perhaps I might preserve
the roots thereof that they perish
not, that I might preserve them
unto myself, I have done this thing.

12 Wherefore, go thy way; watch
the tree, and nourish it, according
to my words.

13 And these will I ‘place in the
nethermost part of my vineyard,
whithersoever I will, it mattereth
not unto thee; and I do it that I may
preserve unto myself the natural
branches of the tree; and also, that I
may lay up fruit thereof against the
season, unto myself; for it grieveth
me that I should lose this tree and
the fruit thereof.

14 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard went his way,
and hid the natural “branches of the
tame olive tree in the nethermost
