were with him, and went in unto
the queen, unto the place where
she sat; and they all “testified unto
her that the king was slain by his
own servants; and they said also:
They have fled; does not this tes-
tify against them? And thus they
satisfied the queen concerning the
death of the king.

35 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah sought the “favor of the
queen, and took her unto him to
wife; and thus by his *fraud, and by
the assistance of his cunning ser-
vants, he ‘obtained the kingdom; yea,
he was acknowledged king through-
out all the land, among all the
people of the Lamanites, who were
¢composed of the Lamanites and
the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites,
and all the dissenters of the Neph-
ites, from the reign of Nephi down
to the present time.

36 Now these “dissenters, having
the same instruction and the same
information of the Nephites, yea,
having been instructed in the same
’knowledge of the Lord, neverthe-
less, it is strange to relate, not long
after their dissensions they became
more hardened and ‘impenitent, and
more wild, wicked and ferocious
than the Lamanites—drinking in
with the “traditions of the Laman-
ites; giving way to ‘indolence, and
all manner of lasciviousness; yea, en-
tirely forgetting the Lord their God.

CHAPTER 48

Amalickiah incites the Lamanites
against the Nephites—Moroni prepares
his people to defend the cause of the
Christians—He rejoices in liberty and
freedom and is a mighty man of God.

AND now it came to pass that, as
soon as “Amalickiah had obtained
the kingdom he began to “inspire the
hearts of the Lamanites against
the people of Nephi; yea, he did
appoint men to speak unto the La-
manites from their ‘towers, against
the Nephites.

2 And thus he did inspire their
hearts against the Nephites, inso-
much that in the latter end of the
“nineteenth year of the reign of
the judges, he having accomplished
his designs thus far, yea, having been
made king over the Lamanites, he
’sought also to ‘reign over all the
land, yea, and all the people who
were in the land, the Nephites as
well as the Lamanites.

3 Therefore he had accomplished
his design, for he had hardened the
hearts of the Lamanites and blinded
their minds, and stirred them up to
anger, insomuch that he had gath-
ered together a numerous host to
go to battle against the Nephites.

4 For he was determined, because
of the greatness of the number of his
people, to “overpower the Nephites
and to bring them into bondage.

5 And thus he did appoint “chief
captains of the *Zoramites, they be-
ing the most acquainted with the
strength of the Nephites, and their
places of resort, and the weakest
parts of their cities; therefore he
appointed them to be chief captains
over his armies.

6 And it came to pass that they
took their camp, and moved forth
toward the land of Zarahemla in
the wilderness.

Amalickiah had thus been obtaining
power by fraud and deceit, Moroni, on
the other hand, had been “preparing
