the *blessing which they shall re-
ceive, after they have scattered my
people—

16 Then shall ye, who are a “rem-
nant of the house of Jacob, go forth
among them; and ye shall be in the
midst of them who shall be many;
and ye shall be among them as a lion
among the beasts of the forest, and
as a young "lion among the flocks
of sheep, who, if he goeth through
both ‘treadeth down and teareth in
pieces, and none can deliver.

17 Thy hand shall be lifted up
upon thine adversaries, and all thine
enemies shall be cut off.

18 And I will “gather my people
together as a man gathereth his
sheaves into the floor.

19 For | will make my “people with
whom the Father hath covenanted,
yea, I will make thy “horn iron, and
I will make thy hoofs brass. And
thou shalt ‘beat in pieces many
people; and I will consecrate their
gain unto the Lord, and their sub-
stance unto the Lord of the whole
earth. And behold, I am he who
doeth it.

20 And it shall come to pass, saith
the Father, that the ¢sword of my
justice shall hang over them at that
day; and except they repent it shall
fall upon them, saith the Father,
yea, even upon all the nations of

23 Behold, I am he of whom Mo-

the Lord your God raise up unto
you of your brethren, like unto
me; him shall ye hear in all things
whatsoever he shall say unto you.
And it shall come to pass that every
soul who will not hear that prophet
shall be cut off from among the
people.

24 Verily I say unto you, yea, and
“all the prophets from Samuel and
those that follow after, as many as
have spoken, have testified of me.

25 And behold, ye are the “children
of the prophets; and ye are of the
house of Israel; and ye are of the
*covenant which the Father made
with your fathers, saying unto Abra-
ham: And ‘in thy seed shall all the
kindreds of the earth be blessed.

26 The Father having raised me
up unto you first, and sent me to
“bless you in *turning away every
one of you from his iniquities; and
this because ye are the children of
the covenant—

27 And after that ye were blessed
then fulfilleth the Father the cov-
