unto him, black and white, ‘bond
and free, male and female; and he
remembereth the ‘heathen; and all
are alike unto God, both Jew and
Gentile.

CHAPTER 27

Darkness and apostasy will cover the
earth in the last days—The Book of Mor-
mon will come forth—Three witnesses
will testify of the book—The learned man
will say he cannot read the sealed book—
The Lord will do a marvelous work
and a wonder—Compare Isaiah 29.
About 559-545 B.c.

Burt, behold, in the “last days, or in
the days of the Gentiles—yea, be-
hold all the nations of the Gentiles
and also the Jews, both those who
shall come upon this land and those
who shall be upon other lands, yea,
even upon all the lands of the earth,
behold, they will be *drunken with
iniquity and all manner of abomi-
nations—

2 And when that day shall come
they shall be “visited of the Lord of
Hosts, with thunder and with earth-
quake, and with a great noise, and
with storm, and with tempest, and
with the flame of devouring fire.

3 And all the ‘nations that *fight
against Zion, and that distress her,
shall be as a dream of a night vision;
yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto
ahungry man which dreameth, and
behold he eateth but he awaketh
and his soul is empty; or like unto
athirsty man which dreameth, and
behold he drinketh but he awaketh
and behold he is faint, and his soul

 

hath appetite; yea, even so shall the
multitude of all the nations be that
fight against Mount Zion.

4 For behold, all ye that doeth in-
iquity, stay yourselves and wonder,
for ye shall cry out, and cry; yea, ye
shall be “drunken but not with wine,
ye shall stagger but not with strong
drink.

5 For behold, the Lord hath poured
out upon you the spirit of deep
sleep. For behold, ye have closed
your “eyes, and ye have ‘rejected the
prophets; and your rulers, and the
seers hath he covered because of
your iniquity.

6 And it shall come to pass that
the Lord God shall bring forth unto
4you the words of a *book, and they
shall be the words of them which
have slumbered.

7 And behold the book shall be
“sealed; and in the book shall be a
‘revelation from God, from the be-
ginning of the world to the ‘ending
thereof.

8 Wherefore, because of the things
which are “sealed up, the things
which are sealed shall not be deliv-
ered in the day of the wickedness
and abominations of the people.
Wherefore the book shall be kept
from them.

9 But the book shall be delivered
unto a man, and he shall deliver
the words of the book, which are the
words of those who have slumbered
in the dust, and he shall deliver
these words unto “another;

10 But the words which are “sealed
he shall not deliver, neither shall he
deliver the book. For the book shall
