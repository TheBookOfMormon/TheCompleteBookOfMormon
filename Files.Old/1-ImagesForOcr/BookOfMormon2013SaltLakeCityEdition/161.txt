children of men, and shall dwell in
a ‘tabernacle of clay, and shall go
forth amongst men, working mighty
fmiracles, such as healing the sick,
raising the dead, causing the lame
to walk, the “blind to receive their
sight, and the deaf to hear, and cur-
ing all manner of diseases.

6 And he shall cast out ‘devils, or
the "evil spirits which dwell in the
hearts of the children of men.

7 And lo, he shall ‘suffer *temp-
tations, and pain of body, ‘hunger,
thirst, and fatigue, even more than
man can ‘suffer, except it be unto
death; for behold, ‘blood cometh
from every pore, so great shall be
his ‘anguish for the wickedness and
the abominations of his people.

8 And he shall be called «Jesus
’Christ, the ‘Son of God, the “Father
of heaven and earth, the ‘Creator of
all things from the beginning; and
his ‘mother shall be called Mary.

9 And lo, he cometh unto his own,
that “salvation might come unto
the children of men even through
*faith on his name; and even after
all this they shall consider him a
man, and say that he hath a ‘devil,

 

and shall “scourge him, and shall
“crucify him.

10 And he shall “rise the third
day from the dead; and behold, he
standeth to ‘judge the world; and
behold, all these things are done
that a righteous judgment might
come upon the children of men.

11 For behold, and also his “blood
*atoneth for the sins of those who
have ‘fallen by the transgression of
Adam, who have died not knowing
the “will of God concerning them,
or who have ‘ignorantly sinned.

12 But wo, wo unto him who
knoweth that he “rebelleth against
God! For salvation cometh to none
such except it be through repen-
tance and faith on the Lord Jesus
Christ.

13 And the Lord God hath sent his
holy “prophets among all the chil-
dren of men, to declare these things
to every kindred, nation, and tongue,
that thereby whosoever should be-
lieve that Christ should come, the
same might receive *remission of
their sins, and rejoice with exceed-
ingly great joy, even ‘as though
he had already come among them.
