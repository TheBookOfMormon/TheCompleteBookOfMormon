18 And who shall say that Jesus
Christ did not do many mighty
*miracles? And there were many
*’mighty miracles wrought by the
hands of the apostles.

19 And if there were ‘miracles
wrought then, why has God ceased
to be a God of miracles and yet be
an unchangeable Being? And be-
hold, I say unto you he ’changeth
not; if so he would cease to be God;
and he ceaseth not to be God, and
is a God of miracles.

20 And the reason why he ceaseth
to do “miracles among the children
of men is because that they dwindle
in unbelief, and depart from the
right way, and know not the God
in whom they should "trust.

21 Behold, I say unto you that
whoso believeth in Christ, doubting
nothing, “whatsoever he shall ask
the Father in the name of Christ
it shall be granted him; and this
’promise is unto all, even unto the
ends of the earth.

22 For behold, thus said Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, unto his
disciples who should tarry, yea,
and also to “all his disciples, in the
hearing of the multitude: Go ye
into all the world, and preach the
gospel to every creature;

23 And he that “believeth and is
baptized shall be saved, but he that
believeth not shall be "damned;

24 And “¢these signs shall follow
them that believe—in my name
shall they cast out ‘devils; they shall
speak with new tongues; they shall

 

take up serpents; and if they drink
any deadly thing it shall not hurt
them; they shall lay ‘hands on the
sick and they shall recover;

25 And whosoever shall believe in
my name, doubting nothing, unto
him will I “confirm all my words,
even unto the ends of the earth.

26 And now, behold, who can stand
‘against the works of the Lord?
*’Who can deny his sayings? Who
will rise up against the almighty
power of the Lord? Who will de-
spise the works of the Lord? Who
will despise the children of Christ?
Behold, all ye who are ‘despisers of
the works of the Lord, for ye shall
wonder and perish.

27 O then despise not, and wonder
not, but hearken unto the words of
the Lord, and ask the Father in the
name of Jesus for what things so-
ever ye shall stand in need. “Doubt
not, but be believing, and begin as
in times of old, and *come unto the
Lord with all your ‘heart, and work
out your own salvation with fear
and trembling before him.

28 Be “wise in the days of your
‘probation; strip yourselves of all
uncleanness; ask not, that ye may
consume it on your ‘lusts, but ask
with a firmness unshaken, that ye
will yield to no temptation, but
that ye will serve the true and
4living God.

29 See that ye are not baptized
“unworthily; see that ye partake
not of the sacrament of Christ
*’unworthily; but see that ye do all
