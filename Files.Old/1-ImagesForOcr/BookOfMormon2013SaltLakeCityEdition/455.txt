22 Father, thou hast given them
the Holy Ghost because they be-
lieve in “me; and thou seest that
they believe in me because thou
hearest them, and they pray unto
me; and they pray unto me because
lam with them.

23 And now Father, I ‘pray unto
thee for them, and also for all those
who shall believe on their words,
that they may believe in me, that
I may be in them °as thou, Father,
art in me, that we may be ‘one.

24 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had thus prayed unto the
Father, he came unto his disciples,
and behold, they did still continue,
without ceasing, to pray unto him;
and they did not ‘multiply many
words, for it was given unto them
what they should "pray, and they
were filled with desire.

25 And it came to pass that Jesus
blessed them as they did pray unto
him; and his “countenance did smile
upon them, and the light of his
’countenance did ‘shine upon them,
and behold they were as “white as
the countenance and also the gar-
ments of Jesus; and behold the
whiteness thereof did exceed all
the whiteness, yea, even there could
be nothing upon earth so white as
the whiteness thereof.

26 And Jesus said unto them: Pray
on; nevertheless they did not cease
to pray.

27 And he turned from them again,
and wenta little way off and bowed
himself to the earth; and he prayed
again unto the Father, saying:

28 Father, I thank thee that thou
hast “purified those whom I have
chosen, because of their faith, and

 

I pray for them, and also for them
who shall believe on their words,
that they may be purified in me,
through faith on their words, even
as they are purified in me.

29 Father, I pray not for the world,
but for those whom thou hast given
me ‘out of the world, because of
their faith, that they may be purified
in me, that I may be in them as thou,
Father, art in me, that we may be
one, that I may be glorified in them.

30 And when Jesus had spoken
these words he came again unto
his disciples; and behold they did
pray steadfastly, without ceasing,
unto him; and he did smile upon
them again; and behold they were
«white, even as Jesus.

31 And it came to pass that he went
again a little way off and prayed
unto the Father;

32 And tongue cannot speak the
words which he prayed, neither
can be written by man the words
which he prayed.

33 And the multitude did hear and
do bear record; and their “hearts
were open and they did understand
in their hearts the words which he
prayed.

34 Nevertheless, so great and mar-
velous were the words which he
prayed that they cannot be writ-
ten, neither can they be “uttered
by man.

35 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had made an end of praying
he came again to the disciples, and
said unto them: ‘So great *faith have
I never seen among all the Jews;
wherefore I could not show unto
them so great ‘miracles, because
of their ‘unbelief.
