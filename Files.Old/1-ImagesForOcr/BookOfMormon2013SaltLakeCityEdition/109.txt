know that it is by "grace that we are
saved, after all we can “do.

24 And, notwithstanding we be-
lieve in Christ, we “keep the law
of Moses, and look forward with
steadfastness unto Christ, until the
law shall be fulfilled.

25 For, for this end was the “law
given; wherefore the law hath be-
come *dead unto us, and we are
made alive in Christ because of our
faith; yet we keep the law because
of the commandments.

26 And we “talk of Christ, we re-
joice in Christ, we preach of Christ,
we ’prophesy of Christ, and we write
according to our prophecies, that
our ‘children may know to what
source they may Look for a “remis-
sion of their sins.

27 Wherefore, we speak concern-
ing the law that our children may
know the deadness of the law; and
they, by knowing the deadness of
the law, may look forward unto that
life which is in Christ, and know for
what end the law was given. And
after the law is fulfilled in Christ,
that they need not harden their
hearts against him when the law
ought to be done away.

28 And now behold, my people, ye
are a “stiffnecked people; wherefore,
Ihave spoken plainly unto you, that
ye cannot misunderstand. And the
words which I have spoken shall
stand as a *testimony against you;
for they are sufficient to ‘teach any
man the ‘right way; for the right
way is to believe in Christ and deny
him not; for by denying him ye also
deny the prophets and the law.

 

29 And now behold, I say unto you
that the right way is to believe in
Christ, and deny him not; and Christ
is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore
ye must bow down before him, and
4worship him with all your ’might,
mind, and strength, and your whole
soul; and if ye do this ye shall in
nowise be cast out.

30 And, inasmuch as it shall be
expedient, ye must keep the “per-
formances and ordinances of God
until the law shall be fulfilled which
was given unto Moses.

CHAPTER 26

Christ will minister to the Nephites—
Nephi foresees the destruction of his
people—They will speak from the
dust—The Gentiles will build up false
churches and secret combinations—The
Lord forbids men to practice priestcrafts.
About 559-545 B.c.

AND after Christ shall have ¢risen
from the dead he shall *show him-
self unto you, my children, and my
beloved brethren; and the words
which he shall speak unto you shall
be the ‘law which ye shall do.

2 For behold, I say unto you that I
have beheld that many generations
shall pass away, and there shall be
great wars and contentions among
my people.

3 And after the Messiah shall come
there shall be “signs given unto my
people of his *birth, and also of his
“death and resurrection; and great
and terrible shall that day be unto
the wicked, for they shall perish;
and they perish because they cast
