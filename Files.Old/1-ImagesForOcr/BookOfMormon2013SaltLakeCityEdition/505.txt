he made unto your fathers, O house
of Israel.

16 And then shall my “revelations
which I have caused to be written
by my servant John be unfolded in
the eyes of all the people. Remem-
ber, when ye see these things, ye
shall know that the time is at hand
that they shall be made manifest in
very deed.

17 Therefore, ‘when ye shall re-
ceive this record ye may know that
the work of the Father has com-
menced upon all the face of the land.

18 Therefore, “repent all ye ends
of the earth, and come unto me,
and believe in my gospel, and be
’baptized in my name; for he that
believeth and is baptized shall be
saved; but he that believeth not shall
be damned; and ‘signs shall follow
them that believe in my name.

19 And blessed is he that is found
“faithful unto my name at the last
day, for he shall be *lifted up to
dwell in the kingdom prepared for
him ‘from the foundation of the
world. And behold it is I that hath
spoken it. Amen.

as a testimony against the world at

5 And if it so be that they repent

name of Jesus, they shall be received

6 And now, if I have no authority

know that I have authority when
