they would not hearken unto his
words; but there arose contentions
among them, even so much that they
did shed blood among themselves.

26 And a “prophet of the Lord have
they slain; yea, a chosen man of God,
who told them of their wickedness
and abominations, and prophesied
of many things which are to come,
yea, even the coming of Christ.

27 And because he said unto them
that Christ was the “God, the Father
of all things, and said that he should
take upon him the *image of man,
and it should be the ‘image after
which man was created in the be-
ginning; or in other words, he said
that man was created after the im-
age of ‘God, and that God should
come down among the children of
men, and take upon him flesh and
blood, and go forth upon the face
of the earth—

28 And now, because he said this,
they did “put him to death; and
many more things did they do
which brought down the wrath of
God upon them. Therefore, who
wondereth that they are in bond-
age, and that they are smitten with
sore afflictions?

29 For behold, the Lord hath said:
I will not “succor my people in the
day of their transgression; but I
will hedge up their ways that they
prosper not; and their doings shall
be as a *stumbling block before
them.

30 And again, he saith: If my people
shall sow “filthiness they shall ’reap
the ‘chaff thereof in the whirlwind;
and the effect thereof is poison.

31 And again he saith: If my

 

people shall sow filthiness they
shall reap the “east wind, which
bringeth immediate destruction.

32 And now, behold, the promise
of the Lord is fulfilled, and ye are
smitten and afflicted.

33 But if ye will *turn to the Lord
with full purpose of heart, and put
your trust in him, and serve him
with all "diligence of mind, if ye do
this, he will, according to his own
will and pleasure, deliver you out
of bondage.

CHAPTER 8

Ammon teaches the people of Limhi—
He learns of the twenty-four Jaredite
plates—Ancient records can be trans-
lated by seers—No gift is greater than
seership. About 121 B.c.

AND it came to pass that after king
Limhi had made an end of ‘speak-
ing to his people, for he spake many
things unto them and only a few of
them have I written in this book, he
told his people all the things con-
cerning their brethren who were
in the land of Zarahemla.

2 And he caused that Ammon
should stand up before the multi-
tude, and rehearse unto them all
that had happened unto their breth-
ren from the time that “Zeniff went
up out of the land even until the
time that he *himself came up out
of the land.

3 And he also rehearsed unto them
the last words which king Benjamin
had “taught them, and explained
them to the people of king Limhi,
so that they might understand all
the words which he spake.
