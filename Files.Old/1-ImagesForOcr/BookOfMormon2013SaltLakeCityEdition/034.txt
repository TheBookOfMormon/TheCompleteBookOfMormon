upon the waters, and upon the land
also, to battle against them.

18 And I beheld that the power
of God was with them, and also
that the wrath of God was upon all
those that were gathered together
“against them to battle.

19 And I, Nephi, beheld that the
Gentiles that had gone out of cap-
tivity were “delivered by the power
of God out of the hands of all other
nations.

20 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,
beheld that they did prosper in
the land; and I beheld a “book, and
it was carried forth among them.

21 And the angel said unto me:
Knowest thou the meaning of the
book?

22 And I said unto him: I know not.

23 And he said: Behold it pro-
ceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew.
And I, Nephi, beheld it; and he
said unto me: The “book that thou
beholdest is a record of the ‘Jews,
which contains the covenants of
the Lord, which he hath made unto
the house of Israel; and it also con-
taineth many of the prophecies of
the holy prophets; and it is a record
like unto the engravings which are
upon the ‘plates of brass, save there
are not so many; nevertheless, they
contain the covenants of the Lord,
which he hath made unto the house
of Israel; wherefore, they are of great
worth unto the Gentiles.

24 And the angel of the Lord said
unto me: Thou hast beheld that the
“book proceeded forth from the
mouth of a Jew; and when it pro-
ceeded forth from the mouth ofa Jew
it contained the fulness of the gospel

 

of the Lord, of whom the twelve
apostles bear record; and they bear
record according to the truth which
is in the Lamb of God.

25 Wherefore, these things go forth
from the “Jews in purity unto the
*Gentiles, according to the truth
which is in God.

26 And after they go forth by the
“hand of the twelve apostles of
the Lamb, from the Jews ’unto the
Gentiles, thou seest the formation of
that ‘great and abominable ‘church,
which is most abominable above
all other churches; for behold, they
have ‘taken away from the gospel
of the Lamb many parts which are
‘plain and most precious; and also
many covenants of the Lord have
they taken away.

27 And all this have they done that
they might pervert the right ways
of the Lord, that they might blind
the eyes and harden the hearts of
the children of men.

28 Wherefore, thou seest that after
the book hath gone forth through
the hands of the great and abomi-
nable church, that there are many
plain and “precious things taken
away from the book, which is the
book of the Lamb of God.

29 And after these plain and pre-
cious things were “taken away it
goeth forth unto all the nations of
the Gentiles; and after it goeth forth
unto all the nations of the Gentiles,
yea, even across the many waters
which thou hast seen with the Gen-
tiles which have gone forth out of
captivity, thou seest—because of
the many plain and precious things
which have been taken out of the
