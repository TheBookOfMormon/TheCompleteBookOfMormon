and done as my father dwelt in a
tent in the “valley which he called
Lemuel.

7 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, took one of the “daughters of
Ishmael to *wife; and also, my
brethren took of the ‘daughters of
Ishmael to wife; and also ¢Zoram
took the eldest daughter of Ishmael
to wife.

8 And thus my father had fulfilled
all the “commandments of the Lord
which had been given unto him.
And also, I, Nephi, had been blessed
of the Lord exceedingly.

9 And it came to pass that the voice
of the Lord spake unto my father
by night, and commanded him that
on the morrow he should take his
«journey into the wilderness.

10 And it came to pass that as my
father arose in the morning, and
went forth to the tent door, to his
great astonishment he beheld upon
the ground a round ball of curious
workmanship; and it was of fine
brass. And within the ball were two
spindles; and the one ’pointed the
way whither we should go into the
wilderness.

11 And it came to pass that we did
gather together whatsoever things
we should carry into the wilderness,
and all the remainder of our pro-
visions which the Lord had given
unto us; and we did take “seed of
every kind that we might carry into
the wilderness.

12 And it came to pass that we did
take our tents and depart into the
wilderness, across the river Laman.

13 And it came to pass that we
traveled for the space of four days,
nearly a south-southeast direction,
and we did pitch our tents again; and
we did call the name of the place
“Shazer.

 

14 And it came to pass that we did
take our bows and our arrows, and
go forth into the wilderness to slay
food for our families; and after we
had slain food for our families we
did return again to our families
in the wilderness, to the place of
Shazer. And we did go forth again
in the wilderness, following the
same direction, keeping in the
most fertile parts of the wilderness,
which were in the borders near the
“Red Sea.

15 And it came to pass that we did
travel for the space of many days,
“slaying food by the way, with our
bows and our arrows and our stones
and our slings.

16 And we did follow the “direc-
tions of the ball, which led us in the
more fertile parts of the wilderness.

17 And after we had traveled for
the space of many days, we did pitch
our tents for the space of a time,
that we might again rest ourselves
and obtain food for our families.

18 And it came to pass that as I,
Nephi, went forth to slay food, be-
hold, I did break my bow, which
was made of fine “steel; and after
I did break my bow, behold, my
brethren were angry with me be-
cause of the loss of my bow, for we
did obtain no food.

19 And it came to pass that we did
return without food to our families,
and being much fatigued, because
of their journeying, they did suffer
much for the want of food.

20 And it came to pass that Laman
and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael
did begin to murmur exceedingly,
because of their sufferings and
afflictions in the wilderness; and
also my father began to murmur
against the Lord his God; yea, and
they were all exceedingly sorrowful,
