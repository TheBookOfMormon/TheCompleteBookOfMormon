4 And it came to pass that after he
had done all this, that king Limhi
dismissed the multitude, and caused
that they should return every one
unto his own house.

5 And it came to pass that he caused
that the ¢plates which contained the
’record of his people from the time
that they left the ‘land of Zara-
hemla, should be brought before
Ammon, that he might read them.

6 Now, as soon as Ammon had
read the record, the king inquired
of him to know if he could inter-
pret languages, and Ammon told
him that he could not.

7 And the king said unto him:
Being grieved for the afflictions of
my people, I caused that “forty and
three of my people should take a
journey into the wilderness, that
thereby they might find the land
of Zarahemla, that we might appeal
unto our brethren to deliver us out
of bondage.

8 And they were Lost in the wilder-
ness for the space of “many days,
yet they were diligent, and found
not the land of Zarahemla but re-
turned to this land, having traveled
ina land among many waters, hav-
ing discovered a land which was
covered with °bones of men, and of
beasts, and was also covered with
ruins of buildings of every kind,
having discovered a land which
had been peopled with a people
who were as numerous as the hosts
of Israel.

9 And for a testimony that the
things that they had said are true
they have brought ‘twenty-four
plates which are filled with en-
gravings, and they are of pure gold.

10 And behold, also, they have
brought “breastplates, which are

 

large, and they are of “brass and
of copper, and are perfectly sound.

11 And again, they have brought
swords, the hilts thereof have per-
ished, and the blades thereof were
cankered with rust; and there is no
one in the land that is able to inter-
pret the language or the engravings
that are on the plates. Therefore I
said unto thee: Canst thou translate?

12 And I say unto thee again:
Knowest thou of any one that can
translate? For I am desirous that
these records should be translated
into our language; for, perhaps,
they will give us a knowledge of a
remnant of the people who have
been destroyed, from whence these
records came; or, perhaps, they will
give us a knowledge of this very
people who have been destroyed;
and I am desirous to know the cause
of their destruction.

13 Now Ammon said unto him: I
can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a
man that can “translate the records;
for he has wherewith that he can
look, and translate all records that
are of ancient date; and it is a gift
from God. And the things are called
‘interpreters, and no man can look
in them except he be commanded,
lest he should look for that he ought
not and he should perish. And who-
soever is commanded to look in
them, the same is called ‘seer.

14 And behold, the king of the peo-
ple who are in the land of Zarahemla
is the man that is commanded to
do these things, and who has this
high gift from God.

15 And the king said that a ¢seer
is greater than a prophet.

16 And Ammon said that a seer is
a revelator and a prophet also; and
a gift which is greater can no man
