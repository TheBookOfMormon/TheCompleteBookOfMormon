appointed was the land of Zara-
hemla, and the land which was
between the land Zarahemla and
the land *Bountiful, yea, to the
line which was between the ‘land
Bountiful and the land Desolation.

24 And there were a great many
thousand people who were called
Nephites, who did gather them-
selves together in this land. Now
Lachoneus did cause that they
should gather themselves together
in the land “southward, because of
the great curse which was upon the
*land northward.

25 And they did fortify themselves
against their enemies; and they did
dwell in one land, and in one body,
and they did fear the words which
had been spoken by Lachoneus,
insomuch that they did repent of
all their sins; and they did put up
their “prayers unto the Lord their
God, that he would deliver them in
the time that their enemies should
come down against them to battle.

26 And they were exceedingly sor-
rowful because of their enemies.
And Gidgiddoni did cause that they
should make “weapons of war of ev-
ery kind, and they should be strong
with armor, and with shields, and
with bucklers, after the manner of
his instruction.

CHAPTER 4

The Nephite armies defeat the Gadian-
ton robbers—Giddianhi is slain, and his
successor, Zemnarihah, is hanged—The
Nephites praise the Lord for their vic-
tories. About A.D. 19-22.

AND it came to pass that in the lat-
ter end of the eighteenth year those
armies of “robbers had prepared
for battle, and began to come down
and to sally forth from the hills,
and out of the mountains, and the

 

wilderness, and their strongholds,
and their "secret places, and be-
gan to take possession of the lands,
both which were in the land south
and which were in the land north,
and began to take possession of all
the lands which had been “deserted
by the Nephites, and the cities which
had been left desolate.

2 But behold, there were no wild
beasts nor “game in those lands
which had been deserted by the
Nephites, and there was no game
for the robbers save it were in the
wilderness.

3 And the robbers could not exist
save it were in the wilderness, for
the want of food; for the Nephites
had left their lands desolate, and
had gathered their flocks and their
herds and all their substance, and
they were in one body.

4 Therefore, there was no chance
for the robbers to plunder and to
obtain food, save it were to come
up in open battle against the Neph-
ites; and the Nephites being in one
body, and having so great a num-
ber, and having reserved for them-
selves provisions, and “horses and
cattle, and flocks of every kind, that
they might subsist for the space
of *seven years, in the which time
they did hope to destroy the rob-
bers from off the face of the land;
and thus the eighteenth year did
pass away.

5 And it came to pass that in the
nineteenth year Giddianhi found
that it was expedient that he should
go up to battle against the Neph-
ites, for there was ¢no way that they
could subsist save it were to plun-
der and rob and murder.

6 And they durst not spread them-
selves upon the face of the land in-
somuch that they could raise grain,
lest the Nephites should come upon
