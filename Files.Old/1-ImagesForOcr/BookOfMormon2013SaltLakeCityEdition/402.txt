AND now it came to pass in the sev-
enty and second year of the reign
of the judges that the contentions
did increase, insomuch that there
were wars throughout all the land
among all the people of Nephi.

2 And it was this “secret band of
robbers who did carry on this work
of destruction and wickedness. And
this war did last all that year; and
in the seventy and third year it did
also last.

3 And it came to pass that in this
year Nephi did cry unto the Lord,
saying:

4 O Lord, do not suffer that this
people shall be destroyed by the
sword; but O Lord, rather “let there
be a *famine in the land, to stir
them up in remembrance of the
Lord their God, and perhaps they
will repent and turn unto thee.

5 And so it was done, according
to the words of Nephi. And there
was a great famine upon the land,
among all the people of Nephi. And
thus in the seventy and fourth year
the famine did continue, and the
work of destruction did cease by the
sword but became sore by famine.

6 And this work of destruction did
also continue in the seventy and
fifth year. For the earth was smitten
that it was “dry, and did not yield
forth grain in the season of grain;
and the whole earth was smitten,
even among the Lamanites as well
as among the Nephites, so that they
were smitten that they did perish
by thousands in the more wicked
parts of the land.

7 And it came to pass that the
people saw that they were about to
perish by famine, and they began
to “remember the Lord their God;
and they began to remember the
words of Nephi.

8 And the people “began to plead
with their chief judges and their

 

leaders, that they would say unto
Nephi: Behold, we know that thou
art a man of God, and therefore
cry unto the Lord our God that he
turn away from us this famine, lest
all the words which thou hast spo-
ken concerning our °destruction
be fulfilled.

9 And it came to pass that the
judges did say unto Nephi, accord-
ing to the words which had been
desired. And it came to pass that
when Nephi saw that the people
had “repented and did humble
themselves in sackcloth, he cried
again unto the Lord, saying:

10 O Lord, behold this people re-
penteth; and they have swept away
the band of Gadianton from amongst
them insomuch that they have be-
come extinct, and they have con-
cealed their secret plans in the earth.

11 Now, O Lord, because of this
their humility wilt thou turn away
thine anger, and let thine anger
be appeased in the destruction of
those wicked men whom thou hast
already destroyed.

12 O Lord, wilt thou turn away
thine anger, yea, thy fierce anger, and
cause that this famine may cease in
this land.

13 OLord, wilt thou hearken unto
me, and cause that it may be done ac-
cording to my words, and send forth
“rain upon the face of the earth,
that she may bring forth her fruit,
and her grain in the season of grain.

14 OLord, thou didst hearken unto
«my words when I said, Let there
be a famine, that the pestilence of
the sword might cease; and I know
that thou wilt, even at this time,
hearken unto my words, for thou
saidst that: If this people repent I
will spare them.

15 Yea, O Lord, and thou seest
that they have repented, because of
the famine and the pestilence and
