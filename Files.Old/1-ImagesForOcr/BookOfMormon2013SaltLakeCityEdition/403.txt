destruction which has come unto
them.

16 And now, O Lord, wilt thou
turn away thine anger, and try
again if they will serve thee? And
if so, O Lord, thou canst bless them
according to thy words which thou
hast said.

17 And it came to pass that in the
seventy and sixth year the Lord did
turn away his anger from the peo-
ple, and caused that “rain should
fall upon the earth, insomuch that
it did bring forth her fruit in the
season of her fruit. And it came to
pass that it did bring forth her grain
in the season of her grain.

18 And behold, the people did re-
joice and glorify God, and the whole
face of the land was filled with re-
joicing; and they did no more seek to
destroy Nephi, but they did esteem
him as a “great prophet, and aman
of God, having great power and au-
thority given unto him from God.

19 And behold, Lehi, his brother,
was not a “whit behind him as to
things pertaining to righteousness.

20 And thus it did come to pass
that the people of Nephi began to
prosper again in the land, and be-
gan to build up their waste places,
and began to multiply and spread,
even until they did “cover the whole
face of the land, both on the north-
ward and on the southward, from
the sea west to the sea east.

21 And it came to pass that the
seventy and sixth year did end in
peace. And the seventy and seventh
year began in peace; and the ¢church
did spread throughout the face of all
the land; and the more part of the
people, both the Nephites and the
Lamanites, did belong to the church;
and they did have exceedingly great
peace in the land; and thus ended
the seventy and seventh year.

22 And also they had peace in the

 

seventy and eighth year, save it were
a few contentions concerning the
points of doctrine which had been
laid down by the prophets.

23 And in the seventy and ninth
year there began to be much strife.
But it came to pass that Nephi and
Lehi, and many of their brethren
who knew concerning the true
points of doctrine, having many
“revelations daily, therefore they
did preach unto the people, inso-
much that they did put an end to
their strife in that same year.

24 And it came to pass that in the
eightieth year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi,
there were a certain number of the
dissenters from the people of Nephi,
who had some years before gone
over unto the Lamanites, and taken
upon themselves the name of La-
manites, and also a certain number
who were real descendants of the
Lamanites, being stirred up to anger
by them, or by those dissenters,
therefore they commenced a “war
with their brethren.

25 And they did commit murder
and plunder; and then they would
retreat back into the mountains,
and into the wilderness and secret
places, hiding themselves that they
could not be discovered, receiving
daily an addition to their numbers,
inasmuch as there were dissenters
that went forth unto them.

26 And thus in time, yea, even in
the space of “not many years, they
became an exceedingly great band
of robbers; and they did search out
all the *secret plans of Gadianton;
and thus they became robbers of
Gadianton.

27 Now behold, these robbers did
make great havoc, yea, even great
destruction among the people of
Nephi, and also among the people
of the Lamanites.
