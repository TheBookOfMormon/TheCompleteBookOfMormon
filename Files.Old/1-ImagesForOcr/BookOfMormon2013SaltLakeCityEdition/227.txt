establish a church in the “land which
was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the
land which was called the land of
Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his
brethren in the waters of Mormon.

4 And behold, I say unto you, they
were “delivered out of the hands
of the people of king Noah, by the
mercy and power of God.

5 And behold, after that, they were
brought into “bondage by the hands
of the Lamanites in the wilderness;
yea, I say unto you, they were in
captivity, and again the Lord did
deliver them out of "bondage by
the power of his word; and we were
brought into this land, and here
we began to establish the church
of God throughout this land also.

6 And now behold, I say unto you,
my brethren, you that belong to
this church, have you sufficiently
retained in “remembrance the cap-
tivity of your fathers? Yea, and have
you sufficiently retained in remem-
brance his mercy and long-suffering
towards them? And moreover, have
ye sufficiently retained in remem-
brance that he has *delivered their
souls from hell?

7 Behold, he changed their hearts;
yea, he awakened them out of a deep
sleep, and they awoke unto God.
Behold, they were in the midst of
darkness; nevertheless, their souls
were illuminated by the light of
the everlasting word; yea, they
were encircled about by the “bands
of death, and the °chains of hell,
and an everlasting destruction did
await them.

8 And now I ask of you, my
brethren, were they destroyed?

 

Behold, I say unto you, Nay, they
were not.

9 And again lL ask, were the bands
of death broken, and the “chains of

Yea, they were loosed, and their
souls did expand, and they did ’sing
redeeming love. And I say unto you
that they are saved.

10 And now L ask of you on what
conditions are they “saved? Yea,
what grounds had they to hope
for salvation? What is the cause of
their being loosed from the bands
of death, yea, and also the chains
of hell?

11 Behold, I can tell you—did
not my father Alma believe in the
words which were delivered by the
“mouth of Abinadi? And was he not
a holy prophet? Did he not speak
the words of God, and my father
Alma believe them?

12 And according to his faith there
was a mighty “change wrought in
his heart. Behold I say unto you
that this is all true.

13 And behold, he “preached
the word unto your fathers, and a
mighty change was also wrought
in their hearts, and they humbled
themselves and put their *trust in
the true and ‘living God. And be-
hold, they were faithful until the
4end; therefore they were saved.

14 And now behold, | ask of you,
my brethren of the church, have
ye “spiritually been "born of God?
Have ye received his image in your
