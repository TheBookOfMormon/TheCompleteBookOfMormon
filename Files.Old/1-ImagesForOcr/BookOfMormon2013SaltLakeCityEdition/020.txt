12 And also a “record of the Jews
from the beginning, even down to
the commencement of the reign of
Zedekiah, king of Judah;

13 And also the prophecies of the
holy prophets, from the beginning,
even down to the commencement
of the reign of “Zedekiah; and also
many prophecies which have been
spoken by the mouth of *Jeremiah.

14 And it came to pass that my
father, Lehi, also found upon the
“plates of brass a °genealogy of his
‘fathers; wherefore he knew that
he was a descendant of “Joseph;
yea, even that Joseph who was the
son of ‘Jacob, who was ‘sold into
Egypt, and who was “preserved by
the hand of the Lord, that he might
preserve his father, Jacob, and all
his household from perishing with
famine.

15 And they were also “led out
of captivity and out of the land of
Egypt, by that same God who had
preserved them.

16 And thus my father, Lehi, did
discover the genealogy of his fathers.
And Laban also was a descendant
of “Joseph, wherefore he and his
fathers had kept the *records.

17 And now when my father saw
all these things, he was filled with
the Spirit, and began to prophesy
concerning his seed—

18 That these “plates of brass
should go forth unto all *nations,
kindreds, tongues, and people who
were of his seed.

19 Wherefore, he said that these

 

plates of brass should ‘never perish;
neither should they be dimmed any
more by time. And he prophesied
many things concerning his seed.

20 And it came to pass that thus
far | and my father had kept the
commandments wherewith the
Lord had commanded us.

21 And we had obtained the records
which the Lord had commanded us,
and searched them and found that
they were desirable; yea, even of
great ‘worth unto us, insomuch that
we could "preserve the command-
ments of the Lord unto our children.

22 Wherefore, it was wisdom in the
Lord that we should carry them with
us, as we journeyed in the wilder-
ness towards the land of promise.

CHAPTER 6

Nephi writes of the things of God—
Nephi’s purpose is to persuade men to
come unto the God of Abraham and be
saved. About 600-592 B.c.

AND now I, Nephi, do not give the
genealogy of my fathers in “this
part of my record; neither at any
time shall I give it after upon these
’plates which I am ‘writing; for it is
given in the record which has been
kept by my “father; wherefore, I do
not write it in this work.

2 For it sufficeth me to say that we
are descendants of “Joseph.

3 And it mattereth not to me that 1
am particular to give a full account
of all the things of my father, for
they cannot be written upon “these
