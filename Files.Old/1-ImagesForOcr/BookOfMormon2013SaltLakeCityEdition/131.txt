unto them of old, saith the Lord
of Hosts.

34 And now behold, my brethren,
ye know that these commandments
were given to our “father, Lehi;
wherefore, ye have known them be-
fore; and ye have come unto great
condemnation; for ye have done
these things which ye ought not
to have done.

35 Behold, ye have done “greater
iniquities than the Lamanites, our
brethren. Ye have broken the hearts
of your tender wives, and lost the
confidence of your children, be-
cause of your bad examples before
them; and the sobbings of their
hearts ascend up to God against
you. And because of the strictness
of the word of God, which cometh
down against you, many hearts died,
pierced with deep wounds.

CHAPTER 3

The pure in heart receive the pleasing
word of God—Lamanite righteousness
exceeds that of the Nephites—Jacob
warns against fornication, lascivious-
ness, and every sin. About 544-421 B.c.

But behold, I, Jacob, would speak
unto you that are pure in heart.
Look unto God with firmness of
mind, and “pray unto him with ex-
ceeding faith, and he will *console
you in your ‘afflictions, and he will
plead your cause, and send down
4justice upon those who seek your
destruction.

2 O all ye that are pure in heart,
lift up your heads and receive the
pleasing word of God, and feast

 

upon his “love; for ye may, if your
ominds are ‘firm, forever.

3 But, wo, wo, unto you that are
not pure in heart, that are filthy
this day before God; for except ye
repent the land is “cursed for your
sakes; and the Lamanites, which
are not filthy like unto you, nev-
ertheless they are ‘cursed with a
sore cursing, shall scourge you even
unto destruction.

4 And the time speedily cometh,
that except ye repent they shall pos-
sess the land of your inheritance,
and the Lord God will “lead away
the righteous out from among you.

5 Behold, the Lamanites your
brethren, whom ye hate because
of their filthiness and the cursing
which hath come upon their skins,
are more righteous than you; for they
have not “forgotten the command-
ment of the Lord, which was given
unto our father—that they should
have save it were "one wife, and
“concubines they should have none,
and there should not be “whoredoms
committed among them.

6 And now, this commandment
they observe to keep; wherefore,
because of this observance, in keep-
ing this commandment, the Lord
God will not destroy them, but will
be ‘merciful unto them; and one
day they shall "become a blessed
people.

7 Behold, their “husbands “love
their ‘wives, and their wives love their
husbands; and their husbands and
their wives love their children;
and their “unbelief and their hatred
towards you is because of the in-
iquity of their fathers; wherefore,
