from Israel head and tail, branch
and rush “in one day.

15 The ancient, he is the head;
and the prophet that teacheth lies,
he is the tail.

16 For the “leaders of this people
cause them to err; and they that are
bled of them are destroyed.

17 Therefore the Lord shall have
no joy in their young men, neither
shall have “mercy on their fatherless
and widows; for ‘every one of them
is a hypocrite and an “evildoer, and
every mouth speaketh ‘folly. For all
this his anger is not turned away,
but his ‘hand is stretched out still.

18 For “wickedness burneth as
the fire; it shall devour the briers
and thorns, and shall kindle in the
thickets of the forests, and they
shall mount up like the lifting up
of smoke.

19 Through the wrath of the Lord
of Hosts is the “land darkened, and
the people shall be as the fuel of the
fire; *no man shall spare his brother.

20 And he “shall snatch on the right
hand and be hungry; and he shall
%eat on the left hand and they shall
not be satisfied; they shall eat ev-
ery man the flesh of his own arm—

21 Manasseh, “Ephraim; and
Ephraim, Manasseh; they together
shall be against °Judah. For all this
his anger is not turned away, but
his hand is stretched out still.

CHAPTER 20

of the destruction of the wicked at the
Second Coming—Few people will be left

 

after the Lord comes again—The rem-
nant of Jacob will return in that day—
Compare Isaiah 10. About 559-545 B.C.

«Wo unto them that decree *un-
righteous decrees, and that write
grievousness which they have pre-
scribed;

2 To turn away the needy from
judgment, and to take away the
right from the “poor of my people,
that ’widows may be their prey, and
that they may rob the fatherless!

3 And what will ye do in the day
of visitation, and in the desolation
which shall come from far? to whom
will ye flee for help? and where will
ye leave your glory?

4 Without me they shall bow down
under the prisoners, and they shall
fall under the slain. For all this his
anger is not turned away, but his
hand is stretched out still.

5 O Assyrian, the rod of mine an-
ger, and the staff in their hand is
“their indignation.

6 I will send him “against a hypo-
critical nation, and against the
people of my wrath willl give him
a charge to take the spoil, and to
take the prey, and to tread them
down like the mire of the streets.

7 Howbeit he meaneth not so, nei-
ther doth his heart think so; but in
his heart it is to destroy and cut off
nations not a few.

8 For he saith: Are not my “princes
altogether kings?

9 Is not *Calno as *Carchemish?
Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not
