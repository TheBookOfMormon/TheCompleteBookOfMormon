he was about to “flatter away those
people to rise up in rebellion against
their brethren.

8 And it came to pass as he was
about to do this, behold, he was
taken, and was tried according to
the “voice of the people, and con-
demned unto death; for he had
raised up in rebellion and sought to
destroy the *liberty of the people.

9 Now when those people who
were desirous that he should be
their governor saw that he was
condemned unto death, therefore
they were angry, and behold, they
sent forth one “Kishkumen, even to
the judgment-seat of Pahoran, and
murdered Pahoran as he sat upon
the judgment-seat.

10 And he was pursued by the
servants of Pahoran; but behold, so
speedy was the flight of Kishkumen
that no man could overtake him.

11 And he went unto those that
sent him, and they all entered into
acovenant, yea, “swearing by their
everlasting Maker, that they would
tell no man that Kishkumen had
murdered Pahoran.

12 Therefore, Kishkumen was not
known among the people of Nephi,
for he was in disguise at the time
that he murdered Pahoran. And
Kishkumen and his band, who had
covenanted with him, did mingle
themselves among the people, ina
manner that they all could not be
found; but as many as were found
were condemned unto “death.

13 And now behold, Pacumeni was
appointed, according to the “voice
of the people, to be a chief judge
and a governor over the people, to
reign in the stead of his brother
Pahoran; and it was according to
his right. And all this was done in
the fortieth year of the reign of the
judges; and it had an end.

14 And it came to pass in the forty

 

and first year of the reign of the
judges, that the Lamanites had
gathered together an innumerable
army of men, and “armed them with
swords, and with cimeters and
with bows, and with arrows, and with.
head-plates, and with breastplates,
and with all manner of shields of
every kind.

15 And they came down again that
they might pitch battle against the
Nephites. And they were led by a
man whose name was “Coriantumr;
and he was a descendant of Zara-
hemla; and he was a *dissenter from
among the Nephites; and he was a
large and a mighty man.

16 Therefore, the king of the La-
manites, whose name was Tubal-
oth, who was the son of ‘Ammoron,
supposing that Coriantumr, being
a mighty man, could stand against
the Nephites, with his strength and
also with his great ’wisdom, inso-
much that by sending him forth
he should gain power over the
Nephites—

17 Therefore he did ¢stir them up
to anger, and he did gather together
his armies, and he did appoint Co-
riantumr to be their leader, and
did cause that they should march
down to the land of Zarahemla to
battle against the Nephites.

18 And it came to pass that because
of so much contention and so much
difficulty in the government, that
they had not kept sufficient guards
in the land of Zarahemla; for they
had supposed that the Lamanites
durst not come into the heart of
their lands to attack that great city
Zarahemla.

19 But it came to pass that Corian-
tumr did march forth at the head
of his numerous host, and came
upon the inhabitants of the city,
and their march was with such
