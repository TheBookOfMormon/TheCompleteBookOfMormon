to become drunk, and the Nephite pris-
oners are freed—The city of Gid is taken
without bloodshed. About 63-62 B.C.

Now it came to pass that when Mo-
roni had received this epistle he was
more angry, because he knew that
Ammoron had a perfect knowledge
of his “fraud; yea, he knew that Am-
moron knew that it was not a just
cause that had caused him to wage
a war against the people of Nephi.

2 And he said: Behold, I will not
exchange prisoners with Ammoron
save he will withdraw his “purpose,
as I have stated in my epistle; for
I will not grant unto him that he
shall have any more power than
what he hath got.

3 Behold, I know the place where
the Lamanites do guard my people
whom they have taken prisoners;
and as Ammoron would not grant
unto me mine epistle, behold, I
will give unto him according to my
words; yea, I will seek death among
them until they shall sue for peace.

4 And now it came to pass that
when Moroni had said these words,
he caused that a search should be
made among his men, that perhaps
he might find a man who was a de-
scendant of Laman among them.

5 And it came to pass that they
found one, whose name was Laman;
and he was “one of the servants
of the king who was murdered by
Amalickiah.

6 Now Moroni caused that Laman
and a small number of his men
should go forth unto the guards
who were over the Nephites.

7 Now the Nephites were guarded
in the city of “Gid; therefore Moroni
appointed Laman and caused that
a small number of men should go
with him.

8 And when it was evening Laman.
went to the guards who were over
the Nephites, and behold, they saw

 

him coming and they hailed him;
but he saith unto them: Fear not;
behold, | am a Lamanite. Behold,
we have escaped from the Neph-
ites, and they sleep; and behold
we have taken of their wine and
brought with us.

9 Now when the Lamanites heard
these words they received him with
joy; and they said unto him: Give
us of your wine, that we may drink;
we are glad that ye have thus taken
wine with you for we are weary.

10 But Laman said unto them:
Let us keep of our wine till we go
against the Nephites to battle. But
this saying only made them more
desirous to drink of the wine;

11 For, said they: We are weary,
therefore let us take of the wine, and
by and by we shall receive wine for
our rations, which will strengthen
us to go against the Nephites.

12 And Laman said unto them: You
may do according to your desires.

13 And it came to pass that they
did take of the wine freely; and it
was pleasant to their taste, therefore
they took of it more freely; and it
was strong, having been prepared
in its strength.

14 And it came to pass they did
drink and were merry, and by and
by they were all “drunken.

15 And now when Laman and his
men saw that they were all drunken,
and were in a “deep sleep, they re-
turned to Moroni and told him all
the things that had happened.

16 And now this was according to
the design of Moroni. And Moroni
had prepared his men with weap-
ons of war; and he went to the city
Gid, while the Lamanites were ina
deep sleep and drunken, and cast in
“weapons of war unto the prisoners,
insomuch that they were all armed;

17 Yea, even to their women, and
all those of their children, as many
as were able to use a weapon of war,
