all these things; yea, the founder
of murder, and ‘works of darkness;
yea, and he leadeth them by the
neck with a flaxen cord, until he
bindeth them with his strong cords
forever.

23 For behold, my beloved breth-
ren, I say unto you that the Lord
God worketh not in darkness.

24 He doeth not “anything save it
be for the benefit of the world; for
he *loveth the world, even that he
layeth down his own life that he may
draw all men unto him. Wherefore,
he commandeth none that they
shall not partake of his salvation.

25 Behold, doth he cry unto any,
saying: Depart from me? Behold,
I say unto you, Nay; but he saith:
«Come unto me all ye "ends of the
earth, ‘buy milk and honey, without
money and without price.

26 Behold, hath he commanded
any that they should “depart out of
the synagogues, or out of the houses
of worship? Behold, I say unto you,
Nay.

27 Hath he commanded any that
they should not partake of his “sal-
vation? Behold I say unto you, Nay;
but he hath °given it free for all
men; and he hath commanded his
people that they should persuade
all men to ‘repentance.

28 Behold, hath the Lord com-
manded any that they should not
partake of his goodness? Behold L
say unto you, Nay; but “all men are
privileged the one ‘like unto the
other, and none are forbidden.

 

29 He commandeth that there
shall be no “priestcrafts; for, behold,
priestcrafts are that men preach
and set *themselves up for a light
unto the world, that they may get
“gain and “praise of the world; but
they seek not the ‘welfare of Zion.

30 Behold, the Lord hath forbid-
den this thing; wherefore, the Lord
God hath given a commandment
that all men should have “charity,
which ‘charity is ‘love. And except
they should have charity they were
nothing. Wherefore, if they should
have charity they would not suffer
the laborer in Zion to perish.

31 But the laborer in *Zion shall
labor for Zion; for if they labor for
“money they shall perish.

32 And again, the Lord God hath
“commanded that men should not
murder; that they should not lie;
that they should not ’steal; that they
should not take the name of the Lord
their God in ‘vain; that they should
not “envy; that they should not have
‘malice; that they should not con-
tend one with another; that they
should not commit ‘/whoredoms;
and that they should do none of
these things; for whoso doeth them
shall perish.

33 For none of these iniquities
come of the Lord; for he doeth that
which is good among the children of
men; and he doeth nothing save it
be plain unto the children of men;
and he “inviteth them *all to ‘come
unto him and partake of his good-
ness; and he “denieth none that come
