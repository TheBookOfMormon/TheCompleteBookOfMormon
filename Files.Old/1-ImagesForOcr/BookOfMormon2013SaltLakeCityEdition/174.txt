city, in unto the king, that I might
know of the disposition of the king,
and that I might know if I might
go in with my people and possess
the land in peace.

6 And I went in unto the king, and
he covenanted with me that I might
possess the “land of Lehi-Nephi, and
the land of Shilom.

7 And he also commanded that
his people should depart out of the
land, and Land my people went into
the land that we might possess it.

8 And we began to build build-
ings, and to repair the walls of
the city, yea, even the walls of the
city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of
Shilom.

9 And we began to till the ground,
yea, even with all manner of ‘seeds,
with seeds of corn, and of wheat,
and of barley, and with neas, and
with sheum, and with seeds of all
manner of fruits; and we did be-
gin to multiply and prosper in the
land.

10 Now it was the cunning and
the craftiness of king “Laman, to
>bring my people into bondage,
that he yielded up the land that
we might possess it.

11 Therefore it came to pass, that
after we had dwelt in the land for
the space of twelve years that king
Laman began to grow uneasy, lest
by any means my people should
“wax strong in the land, and that
they could not overpower them and
bring them into bondage.

12 Now they were a “lazy and an
*idolatrous people; therefore they
were desirous to bring us into bond-
age, that they might glut themselves
with the labors of our hands; yea,
that they might feast themselves
upon the flocks of our fields.

13 Therefore it came to pass that
king Laman began to stir up his

 

people that they should contend
with my people; therefore there be-
gan to be wars and contentions in
the land.

14 For, in the thirteenth year of
my reign in the land of Nephi,
away on the south of the land of
«Shilom, when my people were wa-
tering and *feeding their flocks,
and tilling their lands, a numer-
ous host of Lamanites came upon
them and began to slay them, and
to take off their flocks, and the corn
of their fields.

15 Yea, and it came to pass that
they fled, all that were not over-
taken, even into the city of Nephi,
and did call upon me for protection.

16 And it came to pass that I did
arm them with bows, and with ar-
rows, with swords, and with cime-
ters, and with clubs, and with slings,
and with all manner of weapons
which we could invent, and I and
my people did go forth against the
Lamanites to battle.

17 Yea, in the “strength of the Lord
did we go forth to battle against
the Lamanites; for I and my peo-
ple did cry mightily to the Lord
that he would *deliver us out of the
hands of our enemies, for we were
awakened to a remembrance of the
deliverance of our fathers.

18 And God did “hear our cries
and did answer our prayers; and we
did go forth in his might; yea, we did
go forth against the Lamanites, and
in one day and a night we did slay
three thousand and forty-three; we
did slay them even until we had
driven them out of our land.

19 And I, myself, with mine own
hands, did help to bury their dead.
And behold, to our great sorrow
and lamentation, two hundred and
seventy-nine of our brethren were
slain.
