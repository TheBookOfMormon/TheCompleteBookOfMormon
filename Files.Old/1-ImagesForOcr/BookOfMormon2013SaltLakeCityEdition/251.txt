and high priesthood, is without
beginning or end—

9 Thus they become “high priests
forever, after the order of the Son,
the Only Begotten of the Father, who
is without beginning of days or end
of years, who is full of *grace, equity,
and truth. And thus it is. Amen.

10 Now, as I said concerning the
holy order, or this “high priest-
hood, there were many who were
ordained and became high priests of
God; and it was on account of their
exceeding *faith and ‘repentance,
and their righteousness before God,
they choosing to repent and work
righteousness rather than to perish;

11 Therefore they were called af-
ter this holy order, and were “sanc-
tified, and their *garments were
washed white through the blood
of the Lamb.

12 Now they, after being “sanc-
tified by the *Holy Ghost, having
their garments made white, being
“pure and spotless before God, could
not look upon ‘sin save it were with
“abhorrence; and there were many,
exceedingly great many, who were
made pure and entered into the rest
of the Lord their God.

13 And now, my brethren, I would
that ye should humble yourselves
before God, and bring forth “fruit
meet for repentance, that ye may
also enter into that rest.

14 Yea, humble yourselves even as
the people in the days of “Melchi-
zedek, who was also a high priest
after this same order which I have

 

spoken, who also took upon him
the high priesthood forever.

15 And it was this same Melchizedek
to whom Abraham paid “tithes; yea,
even our father Abraham paid tithes
of one-tenth part of all he possessed.

16 Now these “ordinances were
given after this manner, that there-
by the people might look forward
on the Son of God, it being a ‘type
of his order, or it being his order,
and this that they might look for-
ward to him for a remission of their
sins, that they might enter into the
rest of the Lord.

17 Now this Melchizedek was a
king over the land of Salem; and
his people had waxed strong in in-
iquity and abomination; yea, they
had all gone astray; they were full
of all manner of wickedness;

18 But Melchizedek having exer-
cised mighty faith, and received the
office of the high priesthood accord-
ing to the “holy order of God, did
preach repentance unto his people.
And behold, they did repent; and
Melchizedek did establish peace in
the land in his days; therefore he
was called the prince of peace, for
he was the king of Salem; and he
did reign under his father.

19 Now, there were “many before
him, and also there were many af-
terwards, but ’none were greater;
therefore, of him they have more
particularly made mention.

20 Now I need not rehearse the
matter; what I have said may suf-
fice. Behold, the “scriptures are
