shall be ‘lifted up at the last day,
and shall be saved in the everlasting
kingdom of the Lamb; and whoso
shall "publish peace, yea, tidings of
great joy, how beautiful upon the
mountains shall they be.

38 And it came to pass that I be-
held the remnant of the seed of my
brethren, and also the “book of the
Lamb of God, which had proceeded
forth from the mouth of the Jew,
that it came forth from the Gentiles
*unto the remnant of the seed of
my brethren.

39 And after it had come forth
unto them I beheld “other “books,
which came forth by the power of.
the Lamb, from the Gentiles unto
them, unto the ‘convincing of the
Gentiles and the remnant of the seed
of my brethren, and also the Jews
who were scattered upon all the
face of the earth, that the records
of the prophets and of the twelve
apostles of the Lamb are “true.

40 And the angel spake unto me,
saying: These “last records, which
thou hast seen among the Gentiles,
shall establish the truth of the ‘first,
which are of the ‘twelve apostles of
the Lamb, and shall make known
the plain and precious things which
have been taken away from them;
and shall make known to all kin-
dreds, tongues, and people, that
the Lamb of God is the Son of the
Eternal Father, and the ‘Savior of
the world; and that all men must
come unto him, or they cannot be
saved.

 

41 And they must come according
to the words which shall be estab-
lished by the mouth of the Lamb;
and the words of the Lamb shall be
made known in the records of thy
seed, as well as in the “records of the
twelve apostles of the Lamb; where-
fore they both shall be established
in "one; for there is “one God and
one ‘Shepherd over all the earth.

42 And the time cometh that he
shall manifest himself unto all na-
tions, both unto the “Jews and also
unto the Gentiles; and after he has
manifested himself unto the Jews
and also unto the Gentiles, then
he shall manifest himself unto the
Gentiles and also unto the Jews,
and the °last shall be first, and the
“first shall be last.

CHAPTER 14

An angel tells Nephi of the blessings and
cursings to fall upon the Gentiles—There
are only two churches: the Church of
the Lamb of God and the church of the
devil—The Saints of God in all nations
are persecuted by the great and abomi-
nable church—The Apostle John will
write concerning the end of the world.
About 600-592 B.c.

AND it shall come to pass, that if
the ‘Gentiles shall hearken unto
the Lamb of God in that day that
he shall manifest himself unto them
in word, and also in *power, in very
deed, unto the ‘taking away of their
4stumbling blocks—
