CHAPTER VI.

Anp now IF speak concerning baptism. Behold, elder,
priests, and teachers were baptized ; and they were not bapi-
zed, save they brought forth fruit meet that they were worthy
of it; neither did they receive any unto baptism, save they
came forth with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and wit
nessed unto the church that they truly repented of â€˜all ther
sins. And none were received unto baptism, save they took
upon them thename of Christ, having a determination to sere
him unto the end. And after that they had been received ur
to baptism, and were wrought upon and cleansed by the
power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among tle
people of the church of Christ, and their names were taken,
that #hey might be remembered and nourished by the good
word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them
continually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the mer
its of Christ, who was the author and the finisher of ther
faith. And the church did meet together oft, to fast and 0
pray, and to speak one with another concerning the welfare of
their souls; and they did meet together oft to partake al
bread and wine, in remembrance of the Lord Jesus; and they
were strict to observe that there should be no iniquity among
them; and whoso was found to commit iniquity, and thre
witnesses of the church did condemn them before the elders}
and if they repented not, and confessed not, their names were
blotted out, and they were not numbered among the people of
Christ; but as off as they repented, and sought forgiveness,
with real intent, they were forgiven. And their meetif
were conducted by the church, after the manner of the work:
ings of the spirit, and by the power of the Holy Ghost: for
the power of the Holy Ghost led them whether to preach,
mg or to pray, or to supplicate, or to sing, even so it

one.
