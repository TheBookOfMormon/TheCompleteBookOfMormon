nevertheless, they contain the covenants of the Lord, whic
he hath made unto the House of Israel; wherefore, they a
of great worth unto the Gentiles, |
And the ungel of the Lerd said unto me, Thou hast beheld
that the Book proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew; and
when it proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew, it contained
the plainness of the Gospel of the Lord, of whom the twelve
apostles bear record; and they bear record according to the
truth which is in the Lamb of God; wherefore, these things go-
forth from the Jews in purity, unto the Gentiles, according toâ€™
the truth which is in God; and after that they go forth by the
