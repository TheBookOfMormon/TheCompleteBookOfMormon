the days of Com there began to be robbers in the land; and
they adopted the old plans, and administered oaths after the
manner of the ancients, and sought again to destroy the king-:
dom. Now Com did fight against them much; nevertheless,
he did not prevail against them. And there came also in the
days of Com many prophets, and prophesied of the destruc-
tion of that great people, except they should repent and turn
unto the Lord, and forsake their murders and wickedness.

And it came to pass that the prophets were rejected by the
people, and they fled unto Com for protection, for the people
