the valley that was called Gidcon, being called after the man
which was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword. And
Alma went and began to declare the word of God unto the
church which was established in the valley of Gideon, accor-
ding to the revelation of the truth of the word which had been,
spoken by his fathers, and according to the spirit of prophecy
whieh was in him, according to the. testimony of Jesus Christ,
the Son of God, which should come for to redeem his people
from their sins, and the holy order by which he was called,
And thus it is written. Amen.

that they are established again in the way of his righteousness,
And] trust, aceording to the spirit of God which is in me, that
[shall also have joy over you; nevertheless I do not desire
thet my joy over you, should come by the cause of so much
aff sions and sorrow which Ihave had for the brethren at
Zerhemla: for behold, my joy cometh over them afier wading
