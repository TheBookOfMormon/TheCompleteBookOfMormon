will he suffer that the Gentiles shall destroy the seed of thy
brethren; neither will the Lord God suffer that the Gentiles
shall forever remain in that state of awful woundedness which
thou beholdest that they arc in, because of the plain and most
precious paris of the Gospel of the Lamb which hath beer
kept back by that abominable church, whose formation thou
hast seen; wherefore, saith the Lamb of God, I will be mer-
ciful unto the Gentiles, unto the visiting of the remnant of the
House of Israel in great judgment.

And it came to ‘pass that the angel of the Lord spake unto
me, saying: Behold, saith the Lamb of Ged, after that Ihave

shall be lifted up at the Jast day, and shall be saved in the
Everlasting Kingdom of the Lamb; yea, whoso shall publish
peace, that shall publish tidings of great joy, how beautiful up-

And it came to pass that I beheld the remnant of the seed of
my brethren, and also the book of the Lamb of Ged, which
had proceeded forth from the mouth of the Jew; and T beheld
that it came forth from the Gentiles, unto the remnant of the
seed of my bretliren; and after it had come forth unto them,
I beheld other Books, which came forth by the power of the
