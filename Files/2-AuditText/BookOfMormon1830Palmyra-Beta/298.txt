And behold, now it came to pass that (hose Lamanites wer,
more angry, because they had slain their brethren; therefor
they swore vengeance upon the Nephites; and they did no
more attempt to slay the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi at that
time; but they took their armies and went over into the bor
ders of the land of Zarahemla, and fell upon the people which
were in the land of Ammonihah, and destroyed them, And
after that they had many battles with the Nephites, in the
which they were driven and slain; and among the Lamanites
which were slain, were almost all the seed of Amulon and his.
brethren, which were the priests of Noah, and they were slain

into the east wilderness, and having usurped the power and
authority over the Lamanites, caused, that many of the Laman
