do iniquity, stay yourselves and wonder, for ye shall cry oy,
and ery; yea, ye shall be drunken, but not with wine; ye shell
stagger, but not with strong drink : for bebold, the Lord bath
poured out upon you, the spirit of deep sleep. For behold, ye
haye closed your eyes, and ye have rejected the Prophets, ang
your rulers, and the seers hath he coyered because of you
iniguities.
And it shall come to pass, that the Lord God: shall bri
forth unto you, the words of a book, and they shall be the words
of them which have slumbered. â€” And behold, the book shalj
