every sin, which easily doth heset you, which doth bind you
down to destruction; yea, come and go forth, and shew unto
your God that ye are willing to repent of your sins, and enter
into acovenant with him to keep his commandments, and wit-
ness it unto him this day, by going into the waters of baptism ;
and whosoever docth this, and keepeth the commandments of
God from thenceforth, the same will remember that I say unto
him, yea, he will remember that I have said unto him, he shall
have eternal life, according to the, testimony of the Holy Spirit,
which testifiethin me. Aud now my beloved brethren, do you
believe these things? Behold, I say unto you, yea, I know

And now my beloved brethren, [ have said these things un-

walk after the holy order of God, after which ye have been
received. And now I would that ye should be humble, antf

and joug suffering ; being temperate in all things ; bemg dili-
gent in keeping the commandments of God at all limes; asking
for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and
â€˜emporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever
things ye do receive, and see that ye have faith, hope, and
