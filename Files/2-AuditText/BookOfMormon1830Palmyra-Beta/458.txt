they knew that the prophets had testified of these things for
many years, and that the sign which had been given, was ak
ready at hand; and they began to fear because of their ini
quity and theirunbelief. ‘
And it caine to pass that there was no darkness in all that
night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day. And it
came to pass that the sun did rise in the morning again, ace
cording to its proper order; and they knew that it was the
day that the Lord should be born, because of the sign which
had been given, And it bad come to pass, yea, all things,
every whit, according to the words of the prophets. And it
came to pass also, that a new star did appear, according to
the word. And it came to pass that from this time forth,
there began to be lyings sent forth among the people, by sa
tan, to harden their hearts, to the intent that they might, not
believe in those signs and wonders which they had seen; but
notwithstanding these lyings and deceivings, the more part of
the people did belicve, and were converted unto the Lord —
And it came to pass that Nephi went forth among the people,
and also many others, baplizing unto repentance, in the which,
there were a great remission of sins. And thus the people
began again to have peace in the land; and there were no

err, having not understood the Scriptures. But it came to

the error which they were in: for it was made known unto
them that the law was not yet fulfilled, and that it must be
fulfilled in every whit; yea, the word came unto them that it
ust be fulfilled ; yea, that one jot nor tittle should not pass
way, till it should all be fulfilled; therefore in this same year,
_ were they brought to a knowledge of their error, and did con
fess their faults. And thus the ninety and second year did
pass away, bringing glad tidings unto the people because of
the signs which did come to pass, according to the words of
the prophecy of all the Holy Prophets.

And it came to pass that the ninety and third year did also
pass away in peace, save it were for the Gadianton robbers,
which dwelt upon the mountains, which did infest the land;
for so strong were their holds and their secret places, that the
people could not overpower them; therefore they did commit
many murders, and did do much slaughter among the people
