and the God of Israel shall be your rereward. Behold, my
servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled,
end be very high. As many were astonished at thee 3 (his
visage was 80 marred more than any man, and his form more
than the sons of men:) so shall he sprinkle many nations;
the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had
been told them shall they sec ; and that which they had not
heard shall they consider. Verily, verily, I say unto you, All
these things shall surely come, even as the Father hath eom-
manded me. "Then shall this covenant which the Father hath
tovenanted with his people, be fulfilled; and then shail Jeru-
