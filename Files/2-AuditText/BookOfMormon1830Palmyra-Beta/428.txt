behold, satan did stir up the hearts of the more parts of the
Nephites, insomuch that they did unite with those bands ¢
robbers, and did enter ieto their covenants, and their oaths,
that they would protect’ and preserve one another, in whatso-
ever diflieult circumstances they should be placed in, that they
should not suffer for their murders, and their plunderings, and
their stealings.

And it came to pass that they did have their signs, yea,
their secret signs, and their secret words; and this that they
wight distinguish a brother who had entered into the covenant,
that whatsoever wickedness his brother should do, he should

which spread the works of darkness and abominations ove!
