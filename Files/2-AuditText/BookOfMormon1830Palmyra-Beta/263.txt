they having been called to this holy calling on account of their
faith, while others would reject the spirit of God on account
ofthe hardness of their hearts and blindness of their minds,

jege as their brethren. Or in fino: In the first place they
were on the same standing with their brethren; thus this holy
calling being preparcd from the foundation of the world for
such as would not harden their hearts, being in and through
the atonement of the only begotten Son, which was prepared ;
and thus being called by this holy calling, and ordamed unto
the High Priesthood of the holy order of God, to teach his
commandments unto the children of men, that they also might
enter into his rest, this High Priesthood being after the order
of fis Son, which order was from the foundation of the world ;
orin other words, being without. beginning of days or end of
years, being prepared frou eternity to all eternity, according
to bis foreknowledge of all things. Now they were ordained
dier this manner: Being called with a holy calling, and or-
gained with a holy ordinance, and taking upon therm the High
Priestliood of the holy order, which calling, and ordinance, and
High Priesthood, is witheut beginning or end; thus they ‘be-
come High Priests forever, after the order of the Son of the
only begotten of the Father, which is without beginning of days
or end of years, which is full of grace, equity and truth. And
thusit is, Amen. ;

God, iliey choosing to repent and work righteousness, rather
than toperish ; therefore they were called niter this holy order,
thd were sanctified, ‘and their garments were’ washed white,
‘through the blood of the Lamb. Now they, after being’ sanc-
A by the Holy Ghost, haying their garments made white,
_ Reine pure and vpotiess before God, could not look upon sin,
Sweit were with abhortence; and there were pe excecd-
