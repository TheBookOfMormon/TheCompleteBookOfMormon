be low out of the dust, and their voice shall be as one that
hath a familiar spirit; for the Lord God will give unto hig
power, that he may whisper concerning them, even as it wep
out of the ground; and their speech shall whisper out of ty
dust. For thus saith the Lord God: They shall write the thi
which shall be done among them, and they shall be written ang
sealed up in a book, and they that have dwindled in unbeli
shall not have them, for they seek to destroy the things gf
God: wherefore, as they which have heen destroyed, hay
been destroyed speedily; and the multitude of their terribk
ones, shail be as chaff that passeth away. Yea, thus saith
the Lord God: It shall be at an instant, suddenly.

but he saith, Come unto me all ye ends of the earth, buy
milk and honey, without money, and without price. Behold, |
hath he commanded any that they should depart out of the
Synagogues, or out of the houses of worship? Behold, f say
