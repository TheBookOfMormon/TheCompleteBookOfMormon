 

ple of Ammon, which were Lamanites by birth, did also
og forth into this land.

Aud now there are many records kept of the proceedings
ofthis people, by many of this people, which are particular
and yery large, concerning them ; but behold a hundredth part
athe proceedings of this people, yea, the account of the Las
sianites, and of the Nephites, and their wars, and contentions,
md dissensions, and their preaching, and their prophecies,
aad their shipping, and their building of ships, and their build-
ing of temples, and of synagogues, and their sanctuaries, and
ticir righteousness, and their wickedness, and their rourders,
ad their robbings, and their plundering, and all manner of
dominations and whoredoms, cannot be contained in this
pork; but behold, there are many books and many records of
wey kind, and they have been kept chiefly by the Nephites ;
ad they have becn handed down {rom one generation to an-
ier, by the Nephites, even until they have fallen into trans
gession, and have been murdered, plundered, and hunted, and
iiven forth, and slain, and scattered upon the face of the
arth, and mixed with the Lamanites until they are no more
alled the Nepbites, becoming wicked, and wild, and ferocious,
j@, even becoming Lamanites.
And now [return again to mine account; therefore what I
love spoken had passed afier there had been great conten-
‘iowa, and disturbances, and wars, and dissensions among the
wople of Nephi. ‘The forly and sixth year of the reign of the
ltdges ended. And it came to pass that there was still great
witentions in the land, yea, even in the forty and seventh
year, and also ‘in the forty and eighth year; nevertheless, He-
finan did fill the judgement seat with justice and equity ; yea,
fdid observe to keep the statutes, and the judgements, and
he commandments of God ; and he did do that which was
ht in the sight of God, continually ; and he did walk after
the ways, of his father, insomuch that he did prosper in the
ind, And it‘came to pass that he had two sons. He gave
Wo the eldest the name of Nephi, and unto the youngest the
tame of Lehi. And they began to grow up unto the Lord.—
And it came to pass tliat the wars and contentions began to
a, ina small degree, among the people of the Nephites,
the latter end of the forty and eighth year of the reign of
fe Judges over the people of Nephi. And it came to pass

the forty and ninth year of the reign of the Judges, there
%S continual peace established in the land,. all save it were.
