was given. And after that, the Jawis fulfilled in Christ, thy
they necd not harden their hearts against him, when the lay
had ought to be done away. : â€˜

And now behold, my people, ye are a stiffnecked people,
wherefore, Ihave spoken plain unto you, that ye cannot mis.
understand. And the words which I have spoken, shall stan)
asa testimony against you: for they are sufficient to teach a
man the right way; for the right way is to believe in Chris)
and deny chim not; for by denying him, ye also deny the
Prophets and the law.

And now behold 1 say unto you, that the right way is fc
believe in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Hol
One of Israel: wherefore ye must bow down before him, anj
worship him with all your might, mindjfand strength, and on
whole soul; and if ye do this, ye shall in nowise be cast out
And inasmuch as it shall be expedient, ye must keep the pe.
fermances and ordinances of God, until the law shall be {ub
filled which was given wnto Moses,

And after thateChrist shall have risen from the dead, ls
shall shew himself unto you, my children, and my belovel
brethren; and the words which he shall speak unto you, shal
be the law which ye shall do, For behold, I say unto you, thi
{have beheld thei many generations shal] pass away, and ther
shail be great wars and contentions among my people. Ani
alter that the Messiah shall come, there shall be signs given unly
my people of his birth, and also of his death and resurrection
and great and terrible shall that day be unto the wicked ; fo
they shall perish; and they perish because,they cast out the
prophets, and the saints, and stone them, and slay them:
wherefore the ery of the blood of the saints shall ascend upto
God from the ground, againstt hem. Wherefore all they thatar
proud, and that do wickedly, the day that cometh shall bum)
them ap saith the Lord of Hosts, for they shall be as stubble; |
and they that kill the prophets, and the saints, the depths al
the carth shall swallow them up, saith the Lord of Hosts;
and mountains shall cover them, and whirlwinds shall carry
them away, and buildings shal! fall upon them, and crush them
to pieces, and grind them to powder; and they shall be visited
with thunderings, and lightnings, and earthquakes, and all
manner of destructions, for the fire of the anger of the Lord
shall be kindled against them, and they shall be as stubble,
and the day that cometh shall consume them, saith the Lord

wf Hosts, e:
