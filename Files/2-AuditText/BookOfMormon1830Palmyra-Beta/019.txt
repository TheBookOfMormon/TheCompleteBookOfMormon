was full, and my mother was coinforted; and she
spake, saying: Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath vom-
manded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I
also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my Sons
and delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and gave them
power whereby they could accomplish the thing which the
Lord hath commanded them. And afler this manner of lan-
guage did she speak.

And it caine to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and
did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they
gave thanks unto the God of Israel, And after that they had
given thanks unto the God of israel, my father Lehi took the
