 

city of Moroni did sink into the depths of the sea, and the in-
habitants thereof were drowned ; and the earth was carried up
upon the city of Moronihah, that in the place of the city there-
of, there became a great mountain; and there was a great and
tertible destruction in the land southward. But behold, there
was a more great and terrible destruction in the tand north-
ward: for behold, the whole face of the land was changed,
because of the tempest, and the whirlwinds, and the thunder-
ings, and the lightnings, and the execeding great quaking of
the whole earth ; and the highways were broken up, and the
level roads were spoiled, and many smooth places became
rongh, and many great and notable cities were sunk, and many
were burned, and masy were shook till the buildings thereof
had fallen to the earth, and the inhabitants thereof were slain,
and the places were left desolate; and there were some citics
which remained; but the damage thereof was exceeding great,
and there were many in them which were slain; and there
were some which were carried away in the whirlwind; and
whither they went, no man knoweth, save they know that they
were carried away; and thus the face of the whole earth be-
tame deformed, because of the tempests, and the thunderings,
and the lightnings, and the quaking of the earth. And behold,

the rocks were rent in twain; yea, they were broken up upon
the face of the whole earth, insomuch that they were found in
broken fragments, and in seams, and in cracks, upon all the.
face of the land. “

And it came to pass that when the thunderings, and the —
lightnings, and the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings
ot the earth did cease—for behold, they did Jast for about the
space of three hours; and it was said by sonte that the time
Was greater ; nevertheless, all these great and terrible things
were done in about the space of three hours; and then behold,
there was darkness upon the face of {he land.

And it came to pass that there was thick darkness upon the
face of all the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof whicli
had not fallen, could feel the vapour of darkness; and there _
could be no light, because of the darkness, neither candle my
neither torches ; neither could there be fire kindled with P
fine and exceeding dry wood, so that there could not be a
light at all; and there was not any light seen, neither fire, nor
ghmmer, neither the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so
on were the mists of darkness which were upon the face of

e land. ‘ p
