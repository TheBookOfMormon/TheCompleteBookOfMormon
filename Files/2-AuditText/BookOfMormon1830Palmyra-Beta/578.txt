THE BOOK OF MORONI.
CHAPTER I.

Now I, Moroni, after haying made an end of abridging the
account of the people of Jared, Thad supposed not to have
written more, but Ihave not as yet perished; and I make not
myself known to the Lamanites, lest they should destroy me,
For behold, their wars are exceeding fierce among themselves;
and because of their hatred, they put to death every Nephite
that will not deny the Christ. And 1, Moroni, will not deny
the Christ; wherefore, I wander whithersocver I can, for the
safety of mine own life. Wherefore, I write a few more things,
contrary to that which I had supposed: for I had supposed
not to have written any more ; but I write a few more things,
that perhaps they may be of worth unto my brethren, the La-
manites, in some future day, according to the will of the Lord.

Tur words of Christ, which he spake unto his. disciples,
the twelve whom he had chosen, as he laid his hands upon
them. And he calledthem by name, saying, ¥e shail call on
the Father in my name, in mighty prayer; and after that ye
have done this, ye shall have power that on him whom ye
shall lay your hands, ye shall ‘give the Holy Ghost; and in
my name shall ye give it: for thus do mune apostles. Now
Christ spake these words unto them at the time of his fi
appearing ; and the multitude heard it not, but the disciple:
heard it; and on as many as they Isid their hands, fell the
Holy Ghost. :
