And I saith, Lord, whither shall f go, that Imay find ore to
molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship, after the
manner which thou hast shewn unto me? And it came to pass
that the Lord told me whither I should go to find ore, that 1
might make tools. .

And it came topass that I, Nephi, did make bellowses where-
with to blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; and after that I
had made bellowses, that I might have wherewith to blow the
fire, I did smite two stones together, that | might make fire, for
the Lord had not hitherto suffered that we should make much
fire, as we journeyed in the wilderness; for he saith, 1 will
make that thy food shall become sweet, that ye cook it not;
and I will also be your light in the wilderness ; and I will prepare
the way before you, if itso be that ye shall keep my command-

“waters. And thus my brethren did complain against me, and
were desirous that they might not labor, for they did not believe
‘that 1 could build a ship; neither would they believe that I
was instructed of the Lord. *

And now it came to pass that I, Nephi, was excecding-sor-
aowful, because of the hardness of iheir hearts; and now when
they saw that I began to be sorrowful, they were glad in their
hearts, insomuch, that they did rejoice over me, saying: We
knew that ye could not construct a ship, for we knew that ye
were lacking in judgment; wherefore, thou canst not accom~
