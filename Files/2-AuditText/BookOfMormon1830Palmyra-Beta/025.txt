words of his dream or vision, which were many, he said unte
us, because of these things which he saw in a vison, he excee-
dingly feared for Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared lest they
should be cast off from the presence of the Lord; and he did
exhort them then with all the feeling of a tender parent, that
ihey would hearken to his words, in that, perhaps the Lord
would be merciful to them, and not cast them off; yea, my fa-
ther did preach unto them.

And after that he had preached unto them, and also prophe-
sied unto thein of many things, he bade them to keep the com-
mandments of the Lord; and he did cease speaking unto them.
And all these things did my father sec, and hear, and speak, as
he dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel; and also a great
many more things, which cannot be written upon these plates.
And now, as I have spoken concerning these plates, behold,
they are not the plates upon which I make a full account of the

history of my people; for the plates upon which Y make a full

account of my people, I have given thename of Nephi; where-
fore, they arc called the plates of Nephi, after mine own name;
and these plates also, are called the plates of Nephi.
Nevertheless, [have received a commandment of the Lord,
that I should make these plates, for the special purpose that
there should be an account engraven of the ministry of my
people. Upon the other plates should be engraven an ac-

‘*

count of the reign of the Kings, and the wars, and contentions —

of my people; wherefore, these plates are, for the more part,
ofthe ministry ; and the other plates are, for the more part, of
the reign of the Kings, and the wars, and contentions of my
people. Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to make
these plates, for a wise purpose in him; which purpose, 1
know not, But the Lord knowetb all things, from the begin-
ning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his
works among the children of men; for behold, he hath all pow-
er unto the fulfilling of all his words. And thus itis, Amen,

CHAPTER Hi.

Awp now J, Nephi, proceed to give an account upon these
plates, of my proceedings, and my reign and ministry; where-
fore, to proceed with mine account, I must speak somewhat
of the things of my father, and also of my brethren,
