was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not hig
mouth: heis brought asa lamb to the laughter, and as a she:
before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth. He
was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall dg.
clare his generation? for he wax cut off out of the land of the
living: for the transgressions of my people was he stricke,
And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich ip
his death; because he had done no evil, neither was any de
ceit in his mouth. .

Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him jp
grief: when thou shalt make bis soul an offering for sin, he}
‘shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasup|
of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. He shall see of te
travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowlelg
shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall ber
their iniquitics. Therefore will 1 divide him a portion wit
the great, and be shall divide the spoil with the strong; by
cause he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he wa
numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sins of me
ny, and made intercession for the transgressors.

thus the flesh becoming subject to {he Spirit, or the Soa
the Father, being one God, suffereth temptation, and yieldeh
not to the temptation, but suffereth himself to be mocked, ant

As a sheep before the shearer is durub, so he opened not his
month; yea, even so he shall be led, crucified, and slain, the
flesh becoming subject even unto death, the will of the son
being swallowed up in the will of the Father; and thus God
breaketh the bands of death ; having gained the victory over
death; giving the Son power to make intercession for the
