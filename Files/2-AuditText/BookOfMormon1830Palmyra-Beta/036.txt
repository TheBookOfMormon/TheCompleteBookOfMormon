earth, that the records of the prophets and of the twelve apos-
tles of the Lamb, are true. 4

And the angel spake unto me, saying: These last records
which thou hast seen among the Gentiles, shall establish the
truth of the first, which is of the twelve apostles of the Lamb,
and shall make known the plain and precious things which
have been taken away from them; and shall make known to
all kindreds, tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the
Eternal Father and the Saviour of the world; and that all men”

{srael shall no more be confounded; and that great pit which
“hath been Ggged for them, by that great and abominable’
