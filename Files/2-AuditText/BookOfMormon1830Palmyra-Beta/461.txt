Anp now if came to pass that in the sixteenth year from the
eoningof Clirist, Lachoneus, the Governor of the land, recei-

| yed an epistle from the leaders and the Governor of this band
of robbers; and these wrre the words which were written,

saying: Lachoneus, most noble and Chief Governor of the
land: behold I write this epistle usto you, and do give unto
you exceeding great praise because of your firmness, and also
the firmness of your people, in maintaining that which ye sup-
pose to be your right and liberty; yca, ye do stand well, as if
ye were supported by the hand of a God, in the defence of
your liberty, and your property, and your country, or that
which ye do call so. And it seemeth a pity unto. me, most
noble Lachoneus, that ye should be so foolish and yain as to
suppose that ye can stand against so many brave men, which
are at my command, which do now at this time stand in their
amis, and do await, with great anxiety, for the word, Godown
upon the Nephitcs and destroy them. And I knowing of their
meonquerable spirit, having proved them in the field of bat-
tle, and knowing of their everlasting hatved towards you, be-
cause of the many wrongs which ye have done unio them,
therefore if they should come down against you, they would
visit you with utter destruetion; therefore Thave wrote this

  

-@istle, sealing it with mine own hand, feeling for your wel-

fare, because of your firmness in that which ye believe to be
tight, end your noble spirit in the field of battle; therefore I
mite unto you desiring that ye would yield up unto this my
people, your citics, your lands, and your possessions, rather
than that they should visit you with the swofd, and that de-
suction should come upon you; or in other words, yield
Yourselves up unto us, and unite with us, and become in
led with our secret works, and become our brethren, that ye
may be like unto us; not our slaves, but our brethren, and
Partners of all our substance. And behold, [ swear unto you,
ise willdo this, with an oath, ye shall not be destroyed; hut
ifye will not do this, I swear unto you, with an oath, that on
the morrow month, I will command that my armies shall come
down against you, and they shall not stay their band, and shall â€”
Spare not, but shall slay you, and shall let fall the sword up-
om you, even until ye shall become extinct. And behold, I.

Gadianton ; which society, and the works thereof I know
