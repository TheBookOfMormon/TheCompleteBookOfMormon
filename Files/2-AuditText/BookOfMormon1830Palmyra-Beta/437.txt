with them one by one, insomuch that they did confound them.
Nevertheless, they causcd that Nephi should be taken and
bound and brought before the multitude, and they began to
question him in divers ways, that they might cross him, that
they might accuse him to death ; saying unto him, Thou art
confederate ; who is this man that hath done this murder?
Now tell us, and acknowledge thy fault, saying, Behold here is
money ; and also we will grant unto thee thy life if thou wilt
tell us and acknowledge the agreement which thou hast made
with him. But Nephi saith unto them, O ye fools, ye uncir-
| cumsised of heart, ye blind, and ye stitf-necked people, do ye
know how long the Lord your God. will suffer you that ye
shall go on in this your ways of sin? O ye had ought to be-
