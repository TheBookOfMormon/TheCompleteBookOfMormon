the Lord their God, that he would spare them, and deliver
them out of uc hoaas of their enemies. And it came to pass
fat when the armics of Gaddianhi saw this, they began to
gout with a loud voice, because of their joy; for they had
supposed that the Nephites had fallen with fear, because of
theterror of their armies ; but in this thing they were disap-
inted, for the Nephites did not fear them, but they did feax
ther God, and did supplicate-Him for protection ; therefore
when the armies: of Gidcicnhi did rush upon them, they were
prepared to meet ihem ; yea, in the strength of the Lord they
