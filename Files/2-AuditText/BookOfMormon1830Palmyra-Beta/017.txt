the Lord had delivered Laban into my hands, for this cause :
that I might obtain the records according to his commmand-
menis. Therefore I did obey the voice of the spirit, and took
Laban by the hair of the head, and I smote off his head with
his own sword.

And after that [had smitten off his head with his own sword,
[took the garments of Laban and put them upon mine own
body ; yea, even every whit; and I did gird on bis armour
about my loins. And after that 1 had done this, ] went forth
unto the treasury of Laban. And as I went forth towards the
treasury of Laban, behold Isaw the servant of Laban which had

And it came to pass,that when the servant of Laban beheld
my brethren, he begaii'to tremble, and was about to flee from
before me and retjfra to the city of Jerusalem.

And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also
haying received much strength of the Lord, therefore I did
