For behold, it came to pass that after my father had made
an end of speaking the words of his dream, and also of exhort-
ing them to all diligence, he spake unto them concerning the,
Jews: How that after they were destroyed, yea, even that
great city Jerusalem; and that many were carried away cap-
tive into Babylon; that according to the own due time of the
Lord, they should return again; yea, even be brought back
out of captivity; and after they are broughtyback out of cap-
tivity, to possess again the land of their inheritance.

Yea, even six hundred years from the time that my father

they had slain the Messiah which should come, and after
