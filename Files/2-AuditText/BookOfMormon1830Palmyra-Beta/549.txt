of these things which are written, therefore it sufficeth me to
say, That Jesus shewed himself unto this man in the spirit,
even after the manner and in the likeness of the same body,
even as he shewed himself unto the Nephites; and he minis-
tered unto him, cyen as be ministered unto the Nephites: and
all this, that this man knew that he was God, because of the
many great works which the Lord had shewed unto him. And
because of the knowledge of this man, he could not be kept
trom beholding within the veil: .and he saw the finger of Jesus,
