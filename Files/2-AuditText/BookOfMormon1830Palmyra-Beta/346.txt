the people of Nephi, or that Moroni had prepared his pedple
with breast-plates, and with arm-shiclds; yea, and also-shields:
to defend their heads; and also they were dressed with thick
clothing. Now the army of Zerahemnah was not prepared
with any such thing. They had only their swords, and their
cimeters, their bows and their arrows, their stones and their
slings; but they were naked, save it were a skin which was
girded about their loins; yea, all were naked, saveitwere
the Zoramites and the Amalekites. But they were not armed
with breast-plates, nor shields ; therefore they were exceed
ing afraid of the armies of the Nephites, because of their av
mour, notwithstanding their number being so much greater
than the Nephites. ’

Behold, now it came to pass, that they durst not come
against the Nephites in the borders of Jershon; therefore
they departed out of the land of Antionum, into the wilderness,
and ak their journey round about in the wilderness, away
by the head of the river Sidon, that they might come into the
land of Manti, and take possession of the land; for they dif
not suppose that the armies of Moroni would know whither
they had gone. But it came to pass, as soon as they had de:
parted into the wildemess, Moroni sent spies into ihe wilder

prophecies of Alma, sent certain men unto bim, desiring hint
that he should inquire of the Lord whither the armies of the Nev
phites should go, to defend themselves against the Lamanites
And it came to pass that the word of the Lord canie unto Almay
and Alma informed the messengers of Moroni that the armies ot
the Lamanites were marching round about in the wilderness,
that they might come over into the land of Manti, that they might
commence an attack upon the more weak part of the people
And those messengers went and delivered the message unto
Moroni.

Now Moroni, leaving a part of his army in the land of Jer
~ shon, lest by any means, a part of the Lamanites should come
into that land and take possession of the city ; and Moroni took
the remainder part of his army and marched over into fhe
land of Manti. And he caused ‘that all the people in thit
quarter of the land, should gather themselves together to battle,
against the Lamanites, to defend their tands and their counlry,
their rights and their liberties; therefore they were prepared
against the time of the coming ofthe Lamanités. And it cable
to pass, that Moroni caused that his army should be secreted
