 

the cause of their fall; which was the cause of all mankind
becoming carnal, sensual, devlish, knowing evil from yood,
subjecting themselves to the devil, Thus all mankind were
lost; and behold, they would have been endlessly lost, were
it not that God redeemed his people from their lost and fallen
state. But remember, that he that persists in his own carnal
nature, and goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against
God, he remaineth in his fallen state, and the devil hath alt
power over him. Therefore he is as though there was no
redemption made ; being an cnemy to God ; and also is the devil
anenemy to God. And now if Christ had not come into the
world, speaking of things to come, as though they had already
ome, there could haye been no redemption, And if Christ
had not risen from the dead, or have broken the bands of death,
that the grave should have no victory, and that death should
have no sting, there could have been no resurrection. But
there is a resurrection, therefore the grave hath uo victory,
and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ: He is the
light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless,
that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life which is end-
ess, that there can be no more death, Even this mortal shall
pul on immortality, and this corruption shall put on ineorrup-
tioa, and shall be brought to staud before the bar of God, to
be judged of him according to their works, whether they be
good or whether they be evil. If they be good, to the resur-
rection of endless life and happiness, and if they be evil, to
the resurrection of endless damnation ; being delivered up to
the devil, who hath subjected them, which is damnation; hav-
ing gone according to their own carnal wills and desires ;
having never called upon the Lord while the arms of merey
Was extended towards them ; for the arms of merey was ex-
tended towards them, and they would not; they being war-
ted of their iniquities, and yet they would not depart from
them; and they were commanded to repent, and yet they
Would not repent, And now had ye not ought to tremble and
repent of your sins, and remember only iv and through Christ
ye can be saved? Therefore, if ye teach the law of Moses,
also teach that it is a shadow of those things which are to
come; teach them that redemption cometh through Christ
the Lord, which is the very Eternal Father. Amen.
