ws And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did exhort my breth-
xen, with all diligence, to keep the commandments of the Lord.
And it came to pass that they did humble themselves before
the Lord; insomuch, that I had joy and great hopes of them,
that they would walk inthe paths of righteousness. Now, all
these things were said and done, as my father dwelt in a tent in
the valley which he called Lemuel.

And it came to pass that I, Nephi, took one of the daugh-
