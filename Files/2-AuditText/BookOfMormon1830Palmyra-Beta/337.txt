gifin these things. And I command you io take it upon you
eounsel your elder brothers in your undertakings ; for be-
jold, thou art in thy youth, and ye stand in need to be nour-
shed by your brothers. And give heed to their counsel;
afer not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish
fing; suffer not that the Devil lead away your heart again,
dier those wicked harlots, Behold, O my:son, how great in-
qity ye brought upon the Zoramites: for when they saw
jor conduct, dicy would not believe in my words. And now
feepinit of the Lord doth say unto me, Command thy chil-
jun to do good, lest they lead away the hearts of many peo-
eto destruction: therefore 1 command you, my son, in the
iar of God, that ye refrain from your iniquities ; that ye turn
othe Lord with all your mind, might and strength ; that ye lead
way the hearts of no more, to do wickedly; but rather re-

tow J will ease your mind somewhat on this subject. Behold,
ju marvel why these things should be known so long before-
tnd. Behold, I say unto you, fs not a soul at this time as
fecious unto God, as a soul will be at the time of his coming?
Kitnot as necessary that the plan of redemption should be
mde known unto this people, as well as unto their children ?
kitnot as easy at this time, for the Lord to send his angel to
declare these glad tidings unto us, as unto our children; or
efter the time of his coming? Now my son, here is some-
that more I would say unio thee; for I perceive that thy
and is worried concerning the resurrection of the dead.â€”
Behold, 1 say unto you, that there is no resurrection; or I
fould say, in other: words, that this mortal does not put on
