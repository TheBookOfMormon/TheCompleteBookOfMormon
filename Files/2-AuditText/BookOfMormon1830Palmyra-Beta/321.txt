forth fruit unto you.

Now alter Alma had spoken these words, they sent forth
unto hin desiring to know whether they should believe in one
God, that they might obtain this fruit of which he had spoken,
or how they should plant the seed, or the word, of which he
had spoken, which he said must be planted in their hearts ;
or in what manner they should begin to exercise their faith.
Aad Alma saith unto them, Behold, ye have said that ye could
not worship your God, because ye are cast out of your syua-
ogucs. But behold, {say unto you, H ye suppose that ye
cammot worship God, ye do greatly err, and ye had ought to
search the Scriptures; for it ye suppose that they have taught.
you this, ye do not understand them, Do ye remember to
have read what Zenos, the prophet of old, hath said conceru-
ing prayer or Worship? for he saith, Thou art merciful O
God, for thou hast heard my prayer, even when I was in the
wilderness ; yea, thou wast merciful when I prayed concern-
ing those which were mine cnemies, and thou didst turn them
tome; yea, O God, and thou wast merciful unio me when |
Gil ery unto thee in my field; when I did cry unto thee in my
prayer, end thou didst hear me. And again, O God, whea |
did turn to toy house thou didst hear me in my prayer. And
when 1 did turn unto my closet, O Lord, and prayed unto thee,
thou didst hear me; yea, thou art mercifnl unto thy children,
when they ery unto thee to be heard of thee, and not of men;
and thou wilt hear them; yea, O God, thou hast been merei-
ful unto me, and beard my cries in the midst of thy congrega-
tions; yea, and thou hast also heard me when 1 have been cast
out, and have been despised by mine enemies ; yea; thou didst
hear my cries, and wast angry wilh maine enemies, and thov
didst visit them in thine anger, with speedy destruction; and
thou didst hear me because of mine afitictions and my sincer-
i; and it is becausc of thy Son that thou hast been thus mer
eifil unto me; therefore I will cry unto thee in all mine afllic-
tions; for in thee is my joy;, for thou hast turncd thy judy-
ments away from me, because of thy Son,

And now Alma saith unto them, De ye believe those Serip-
times which have been written by them of old? Behold, if ye
do, ye must believe what Zenos saith; for behold, he saith,
thou hast turned away thy judgments, because of thy Son.â€”
Now beh ld, my brethren, I would ask, if ye haye read the
Scnpture 2? Ifye have, how can ye disbelieve on the Son
