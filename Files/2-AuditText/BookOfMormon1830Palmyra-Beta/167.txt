king Benjamin again opened his mouth, and began to speak
unto them, saying, My inends and my brethren, my kindred
and my people, 4 would again cali your attention, that ye may
hear and understand the remainder of my words which I shall
speak unto you: for behold, that if the knowledge of the
goodness of God at this time, hath awakened you to a sense
of your nothingness, and your worthless and fallen state; I
say unto you, that if ye have come to a knowledge of the
goodness of God, and his matchless power, and his wisdom,
and his patience, and his long sulfering towards the children
of men, and also, the atonement which hath been prepared
from the foundation of the world, that thereby salvation might
come to him that should put his trust in the Lord, and should
be diligent in keeping his commandments, and continue in the
faith even unto the end of his life; I mean the life of the mor-

love, and have received a remission of your sins, which cau-

that ye should remember, and always retain in remebrance,
the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his good-
ness and long suffering towards you unworthy creatures, and
humble yourselves even in the depths of humility, calling on
the name of ihe Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in the faith
