wherefore, after that he was baptized with water, the Holy
Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove. And again:
It sheweth unto the children of men the straightness of the
path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should
enter, he having set the example before them. And he saith
unto the children of men, Follow thou me. Wherefore, my
beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus, save we shall be wil-

ther saith, Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name
of my beloved Son. And also, the voice of the Son came
