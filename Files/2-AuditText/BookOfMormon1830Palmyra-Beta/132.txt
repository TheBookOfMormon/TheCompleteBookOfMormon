down justice upon those who seek your destruction,

O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive
the pleasing word of God, and feast upon his love; for y
my, if your mms are firm, forever. But, wo, WO, bt
you that are uot pure in heart; that are filihy this day befog
God; for except ye shall repent, the land is cursed for you
sakes; and the Lamanites, which are not filthy like unto you,
(nevertheless, they are cursed with a sore cursing) shail scour
You even unto destruction, And the time speedily comet,
that except ye repeut, they shall possess the land of your in
herilance, andthe Lord God will lead away the righteous gy)
from among you. Behold, the Lamanites your brethrea,
who ye hate, because of their filthiness and the Cursings
Witish hath come upon their skins, are more righteous than you;
