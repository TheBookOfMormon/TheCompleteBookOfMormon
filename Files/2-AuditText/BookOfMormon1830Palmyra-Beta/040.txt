such thing known unto us. Behold, I said unto them, Howjs
it that ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord? How
is it that ye will perish, because of the hardness of your hearts?
Do ye.not remember the things which the Lord hath said: If
ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing
that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my command-
ments, surely, these things shall be made known unto you?
Behold, I say unto you, that the House of Israel was com-
pared unto an olive tree, by the spirit of the Lord which was
in our fathers; and, behold, are we not broken off from the
House of Israel; and are we not a branch of the House of Is-
rael? And now, the thing which our father meaneth concer

unto you, Yea; they shall be remembered again among the
House of Israel; they sball be grafted in, being a natural
branch of the olive tree, info the true olive tree; and this 1s
what our father meaneth ; and he meaneth that it will not come
to pass, until after that they are scattered by the Gentiles;
and he meaneth that it shall come by way of the Gentiles, that â€”
the Lord may shew his power unto the Gentiles, for the very
cause that he shall be rejected of the Jews, or of the House
of Israel; wherefore, our father hath.nzot spoken of our seed
alone, but also of all the House of Israel, pointing to the cove-
