this was the covenant which they made; and they cast they
garments at the feet of Moroni, saying: We covenant wig
our God, that we shall be destroyed, even as our brethren jy
the land northward, if we shall fall into transgression; se,
he may cast us at the feel of our enemies, even as we hay
cast our garments at thy feet, to be trodden under foot, ify,
shall fall into transgression. Moroni saith unto them, Beholj
we are a remnant of the seed of Jacob; yea, we area ep.
nant of the seed of Joseph, whose coat was rent by his brah
ren, into many picces; yea, and now behold, let us »,
member to keep the commandments of God, or our garmay
shall be rent by our brethren, and we be cast into prison, ork
sold, or be slain; yea, let us preserve our liberty, as a rempy
of Joseph ; yea, Jet us remember the words of Jacob, beliy
bis death; for behold, he saw thata part of the remnang
the coat of Joseph was preserved, and had not decayed, 4q
he saith, Even as this remnant of garmeut of ary sons hath hey
preserved, so shall a remnant of the seed of my son be press

_ ved by the hand of God, and be taken unto himself, while th
remainder of the seed of Joseph shall perish, even as the rm
nant of his gannent. Now behold, this giveth my soul sore;
nevertheless, my soul hath joy in my son, because that pand
bis seed which shall be taken unio God. Now behold, te
_ was the language of Jacob. And now who knoweth but whe
the remnant of the seed of Joseph, which shall perish as tis
garment, are those which have dissented from us; yea,am
even it shull be us, if we do not stand fast in the faith of Chris

And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said ter
words, he went forth, and also. sent forth in ell the parts oft
Jand where there were dissentions#end gathered together alle
people which were desirous to maiutain their liberty, to stall
against Amalickiah, and thosc which had dissented, whid
were called Amalickiahites.

And it came to pass that when Amalickiah saw that the pet
ple of Morom were more numerous than the Amelickiahites
and he aleo saw that his people were doubtfnl concerning thes
tice of tho cause in which they had undertaken ; therelon

, fearing that heshould not gain ‘he point, he tock thase of bis
peopie which would, and depavied into the land of Nephh

Now Moroni thought it was not expedient that the Lam
ites should have any more stren (i; therefore he thougld ©
cut of the people of Amalickis:, orto teke them and bn
them back, and put Amalickiah to death ; yea, for he knew!
