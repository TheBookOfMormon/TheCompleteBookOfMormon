And it came to pass that the Lamanites took courage, ani
began to pursue them; and thus were the Lamanites pursuing
them with great vigor, when [claman came upon their rear
with his two thousand, and began to slay them exceedingly,
insomuch that the whole army of the Lamanites halted, and
turned upon Helaman, Now when the people of Antipus
saw that the Lamanites had turned them about, they gathered
together their men, and came again upon the rear of the La
manites.

And now it came to pass that we, the people of Nephi, the
