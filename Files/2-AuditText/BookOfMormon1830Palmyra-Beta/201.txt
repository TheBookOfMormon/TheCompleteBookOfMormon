Andit came to pass that the battle became exceeding sore,
for they fought like Kons for their prey. And it came to pass
that the people of Limhi began to drive the Lamanites before
them, yet they were not half so numerous as the Lamanites.
But they fought for their lives, and for their wives, and for their
children; therefore they exerted themselves, and like dragons
did they fight.

And it came to pass that they found the king of the Laman-
ites among the number of their dead; yet he was not dead,
haying been wounded and left upon the ground, so speedy was
the fight of his people. And they took bim and bound up his
wounds, and brought him before Limhi, and said, Behold, here
isthe king of the Lamanites; he having received a wound,
hath fallen among their dead, and they have left him; and be-

they which have stolen the daughters of the Lamanites? And
now behold, and tell the king of these things, that he may tel}
his people, that they may be pacified towards us: for behold,
they are already preparing to come against us; and behold al-

US, We must perish. For are not the words of Abinadi fulfilled,
Which he prophesied against us? and all this because we would,
