ren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may know.geod from
evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know with
a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night—
For behold, the spirit of Christ is given to every man, :that
they may know good from evil; wherefore I shew unto you ‘
the way to judge : for every thing which inviteth to do good,
and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the pow-
