And it was the daughter of Jared which put it into -his hear
to search up these things of old; and Jared put it into the
heart of Akish; wherefore Akish administered it unto his kin
dreds and friends, leading them away by fair promises to dp
whatsoever thing he desired. And it came to pass that they
formed a secret combination, even as they of old; which com
bination is a most abominable and wicked above all, in the
sight of God: for the Lord worketh not in secret combinz |
tions, neither doth he will that man should shed blood, but in
all things hath forbidden it, from the beginning of man. And
now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of their oaths ani
combinations, for it hath been made known unto me that they
are had among all people, and they are had among the Laman

even the sword of the justice of the eternal God, shall fall up

when ye shall see these things come among you, that ye shall
awale to a sense of your awful situation, because of this ®
eret combination which shall be among you, or wo be unto it
because of the blood of them which have been slain: for tey
_ ery from the dust for vengeance upon it, and also upon thew
who build it up. For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth
up, seeketh to overthrow the freedom of all lands, nations all
countries ; and it bringeth to pnss the destruction of all pe
ple: for it is built up by the devil, which is the father of all
lies; even that same liar which beguiled our first parents; Kel
