had gathered together so great an army for to go against the
Nephiles to battle. But behold, as the king came out to mee,
him, Amalickiah caused that his servants should go forth tg
meet the king. And they went and bowed themselves before
the king, as if to reverence him, because of his greatness â€”
And it came to pass that the king put forth his hand to raise
them, as was the custom with the Lamanites, and a token of
peace, which custom they had taken from the Nephites. And
it came to pass that when he had raised the first from the
ground, behold, he stabbed the king to ihe heart; and he fell
to the earth. Now the servants of the king fled; and the ser.
vants of Amalickiah raised a cry, saying: Behold, the servants
of the king have stabbed him to the heart, and he has fell, and

the king was slain: for Amalickial had sent an embassy to
the queen, informing her that the king had been stain by his
servants; that he had pursued them with his army, but it was
in vain, and they had made their escape: Therefore when the
queen had received this message, she sent unto Amalickizh,
desiring him that he would spare the people of the city; and
she also desired him that he should come in unto her; and
she also desired him that he should bring witnesses with hin,
