to be good; and they are of ancient date, and they have ber |
handed down unto us. And I write this epistle unto you, Le
choneus, and I hope that ye will deliver up your Jands, an]
your possessions, without the shedding of blood, that this ny
people may recover their rights aud government which hare

And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this
epistle, he was exceedingly astonished, because of the holt
ness of Giddianhi, demanding the possession of the land oj
