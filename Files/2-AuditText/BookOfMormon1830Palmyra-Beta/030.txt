were sick, and which were afllicted of all manner of diseases,
and with devils, and unclean spirits; and the angelspake, and
shewed all these things unio me. And they were healed by
the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the un-

And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again,

Â» saying, look! And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that
he was taken by the people; yea, the Everlasting God, was
