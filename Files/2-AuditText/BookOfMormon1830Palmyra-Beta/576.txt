ple which were for Coriantumr, were gathered together to the
army of Coriantumr; and the people which were for Shiz,
Were gathered together to the army of Shiz; wherefore they
were for the space of four years, gathering together the peo
â€˜ple, that they might get all which were upon the face of the
and, and that they might receive all the strength which it were
possible that they could receive. And it came to pass that
when they were all gathered together, every one to the amy
which he would, with their wives, and their children ; both
met, women and chfldren being armed with weapons of war,
