peing the chief judge, and the governor of the people of Nephi,
therefore he went up with his people, yea, with his captays
and chief captains, yea, at the head of bis armies, against the
‘Amlicites to battle ; and they began to slay the Aunlicites up
the hill east of Sidom. And the Amlicites did contend with ile
Nephites with great strength, insomuch that many of the Ne
phites did before the Amlicites ; nevertheless the Loy
did strengiMel the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the
Amlicites with agreat slaughter, that they began to flee below
them. And it came to pass that the Nephites did pursue the

Nephites, six thousand five hundred sixty and two souls,
