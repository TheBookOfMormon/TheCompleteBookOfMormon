Judges, Moronihah did succeed with his armies, in obtajy)
many parts of the land; yea, they retained many cities 9
had fallen into the hands of the Lamanites. ‘
"And it came to pass in the sixty and first year of the,
of the Judges, they succeeded in retaining even the half g
their possessions. Now this great loss of the Nephites,
the great slaughter which was among them, would not
happened, had it not been for their wickedness and their
mination which was among them ; yea, and it was among
also which professed to belong to the church of God; ani:
was because of the pride of their hearts, because of thera
eceding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression tot;
poor, withholding their food from the hungry, withholily
their clothing from the naked, and smiting theiv humble bret
ren upon the cheek, making a mock of that which was saz
denying the. spirit of prophecy and of revelation, murder
plundering, lying, steeling, committing adultery, raising up
great contentions, and deserting away into the land of Neti
among the Lamanites ; and because of this thcir great wid
edness, and their boastings in their own strength, they wer
jeft in their own strength ; therefore they did not prosper, lw
were afflicted, and smitten, and driven before the Lamania,
until they had lost possession of almost all their Jands. Bi,
behold, Moronihah did preach many things unto the peok
because of their iniquity, and also Nephi and Lehi, wiid
were the sons of Helaman, did preach many things unto tk
people; yea, and did prophesy many things unto them ce}
cerning their iniquitics, and what should come unto theni
they did not repent of theit sins. And it came to passili
they did repent, and inasmach as they did repent, they didle
gin to prosper; for when Moronihah saw that they did
pent, he did venture to lead them forth from place to ple
and from city to city, even until they had retained the anelil
of their property, and the one half of all theirlands, And tie
ended the sixty and first year of the reign of the Judges.
And it came to pass in the sixty and second year of!

reign of the Judges, that Moronibah could obtain no morep®
sessions over the Lamanites ; therefore they did abandon i®
design to obtain the remainder of their lands, for so nunem
was the Lamanites that it became impossible for the Nephité
to obtain more power over them ; therefore Moronihal

employ all his armics in maintaining those parts which be

taken, . e
