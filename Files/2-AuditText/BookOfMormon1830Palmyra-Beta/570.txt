And now I would commend you to Seek this Jesus of whon
the prophets and apostles have written, that the Grace of God
the Father, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy
Ghost, which beareth record of them, may be, and abide in
you forever. Amen.

CHAPTER VI.

Ano now J, Moroni, proceed to finish my record concerning
the destruction of the people of which I nave been writing —
For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether: for he truly
told them of all things, trom the beginning of man; and how
that after the waters had receded from off the face of' this land,
it became a choice land above all other lands, a chosen land

salem of old; and they shall nc more be confounded, until the:
end come, when the earth shall pass away. And there shall
be a new heaven anda new earth; and they shall be like und
