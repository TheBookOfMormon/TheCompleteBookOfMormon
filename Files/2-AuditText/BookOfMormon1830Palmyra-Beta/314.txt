Nephites, and called themselves Zoramites, being led bya
man whose name was Zoram; and as he went forth among
them, behold, he was run upon, and trodden down, even ugg
he was dead; and thus we sce the end of him who pervert
the ways of the Lord; and thus we see that the Devil will ne
support his children at the last day, but doth speedily drag
them down to hell.

Now it came to pass that after the end of Koribor, Alm
having received tidings that the Zoramites were perverting the
ways of the Lord, and that Zoram, which was their leade,
was leading the hearts of the people to bow down to duh
idols, &e., his heart again began to sicken, because of the ig.

Omner; and Himni he did leave in the church in Zarahuml
but the former three he took with him, and also Amulek ant
Zeezrom, which were at Melek; and he aleo tool: two of lis
sons. Now the cldest of his sons he took not with him; aul
his name was Helaman; but the names of those which kt
took with him, were Shiblon and Corianton: and these at
the names of those which went with him among the Zoramiies

to preach unto them the word.

Â«Now the Zoramites were dissenters from the Nephites;
therefore they had the word of God preached unto them. But
