also the words which was spoken by this'man, Moses, which
had such great power given unto him ; yea, the words whi
he hath spoken concerning the coming of the Messiah. Ya,
did he not bear record, that the Sou of God should come!~
And as he lifted up the brazen serpent in the wilderness, erm
so shall he be lifted up which should come. And as munya
should jook upon that serpent should live, cven so as manyy
should look upon the Son of God, with faith, faving a co
trite spirit, might live, even unto that life which is eternal=
And now behold, Moses did not only testify of these thing,
but also all the holy prophets, from bis day even to the dap
of Abrabam. Yea, and behold, Abraham saw of his comiig
and was filled with gladness, and did rejoice. Yea, and be
hold Tsay unto you, That Abraham not only knew of thre
things, but there wereâ€™many before the days of Abrabat
which were culled by the order of God; yeu, even afiertle
order of his Son; and this that it should be shewn untotie

and do ye not behold that the seed of Zedekiah are with!
and they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem? Bat iy
hold, this is not all... Our father Lehi was driven out of Jane

day which is to come. And hehold, he is Gpd, and bes
with them, and he did manifest himself unto. them, that they
were redeemed by him ; and they gave unto him glory, heeaus
of that which is to come, Ant now seeing ye know thet
