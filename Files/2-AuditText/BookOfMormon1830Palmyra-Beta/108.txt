becn carried away, they shalt return again, and possess the
Jand of Jerusalem ; wherefore they shall be restored again to
the Iands of their inheritance. But, behold, they shall have.
wars, and rumors of wars; and when the day cometh that the
enly begotten of the Father, yea, even the Father of heaven ani
of earth, shall manifest himself unto them in the flesh, behold,
they will reject him, because of their iniquities, and the hand.
