/ CHAPTER VIL

Ann now I, Moroni, write a few of the words of my fa-
ther Mormon, which he spake concerning faith, hope and cha-
rity: for after this manner did he speak unto the people, as
he taught them in the synagogue which they had built for the
place of worship. And now J, Mormon, speak unto you, my
beloved brethren; and it is by the grace of God, the Father,
and our Lord Jesus Christ, and his holy will, because of the
gift of his calling unto me, that Iam permitted to speak unto
you at this time ; wherefore I would speak unto you that are
of the church, that are the peaceable followers of Christ,
and that have obtained a sufficient hope, by which ye can enter
into the rest of the Lord, frojn this time hence forth, until ye
shall rest with him in Heaven. And now my brethren, I
judge these things of you because of your peaceable walk with
the children of men: for remember the word.of God, which
saith, By their works ye shall know them: for if their works
be good, then they are good also. For behold, God hath said,
A man being evil, cannot do that which is good: for if pe of
fereth a gift, or prayeth unto God, except he shall dovit with
veal intent, it profiteth him nothing. For behold, it is not
vounted unto him for righteousness. For behold, if a man
being evil, giveth a gift, he docth it grudgingly ; wherefore it
is counted unto him the same as if he had retained the gilt;
wherefore he is counted cvil before God. And likewise also
is it counted cyil unto a man, if he shall pray, and not with
real intent of heart; yea, and it profiteth him nothing: for God
receiveth none such; wherefore, 4 man being evil, cannot do
that which is good; neither will he.give a good gift. For he-

hold, a bitter fountain cannot bring-forth good water; neither
‘can a good fountain bring forth bilter water ; wherefore a man
being the servant of the Devil, cannot follow Christ; and if he
follow Christ, he cannot be a servant of the Devil. Where-
fore, all things which are good, cometh of God; and that which
is evil, cometh of the Devil: for the Devil is an enemy unto
God, and fighteth against him continually, and inviteth and en-
iceth to sin, and to do that which is evil continually, But
hold, that which is of God, inviteth and enticeth to do good
tinuelly; wherefore, every thing which inviteth and: enti-

th to-do goad, and to love God, and to serve him, is inspired

®f God. Wherefore take heed, my beloved brethren, that ye
do not judge that which is evil to be of God, or that which is
