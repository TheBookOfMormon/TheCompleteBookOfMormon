CHAPTER Xxv.

Ap now it came to pass in the twenty and ninth year of
the Judges, that Ammoron sent unto Moroni, desiring that he
would exchange prisoners, And it came to pass that Moroni
{et to rejoice exceedingly at this request, for he desired the
povisions which was imparted for the support of the Laman-
