ga praising their God, for the great thing which he had done
for them, in preserving them from falling into the hands of
their enemies; yea, they did cry, Hosanna to the Most High
God; and they did cry, Blessed be the name of the Lord
God Almighty, the Most High God, And their hearts were
swollen with joy, unto the gushing out of many tears, because
ofthe great goodness of God in delivering them out of the
hands of their enemics; and they knew it was because of
their repentance and their humility that they had been deliy-

which did doubt in the least thing in the words of all the holy

many as there were who did not enter into a covenant, and
who did still continue to have those secret murders in their

inst their brethren, were condemned and punished accor-
ding to the law. And thus they did put an end to all those
Weked, and secret, and abominable combinations, in the
Thich there were so much wickedness, and so many murders
tommitted, And thus had the twenty and second year passed
Stray, and the twenty and third year also, and the twenty and
fourth, and. the twenty and fifth; and. thus had twenty and

Which, in the eyes of some, would be great and marvellous ;
