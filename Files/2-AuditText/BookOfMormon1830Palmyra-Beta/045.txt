And there was also written upon them, @ new writing, which
was plain to be read, which did give us understanding con-
cerning the ways of the Lord; and if was written and changed
from time to time, aceording to the faith and diligence which
ave gave unto it: And thus we see, that by small means, the
Lord can bring about great thing : :

And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did go forth up into the
top of the mountain, according to the directions which were
given upon the ball, And it came to pass that I did slay wild
beasts, insomuch, that J did obtain food for our families —
And it came to pass that I did return to our tents, bearing the
beasts which Thad slaing and now, when they beheld that I
had obtained food, how great was their joy. And it came to
pass that they did humble themselves before the Lord, and did
give thanks unto his. ” : ,

And it came to pass that we did again take our journey,
travelling nearly the same course as in the beginning; and
after that we had travelled for the space of many days, we did
pitch our tents again, that we might tarry for the space of @ .
time,

And it caine to pass that Ishmael died, and was buried in
the place which was called Nahom. And it came to pass that
the daughters of Ishmael did mourn exceedingly, because of
the loss of their father, and because of their afilictions in the
wilderness; and they did murmur against my father, because:
that he had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, saying:
Our father is dead’; yea, and we have wandered much in the
wilderness, and we have suffered much affliction, hunger,
thirst, and fatigue; and after all these sufferings, we must pe-
rish in the wilderness with hunger. And thus they did mur-
mur against my father, and also against me; and they were
desirous to return again to Jerusalem. And Laman saith unto
Lemuel, and also unto the sons of Ishmael, Behold, let us slay
our father, and also our brother Nephi, who hath taken it upon”
lim to be our ruler and our teacher, who are his elder breth-
ren, Now, he saith that the Lord hath talked with him, and
also, that angels hath ministered unto him! But behold, we
know that héieth unto us; and he telleth us these things, and
he worketh many things by his cunning arts, that ay de-
ceive our eyes, thinking, perhaps, that he may lead us away
inte some strange wilderness; and after that he hathJed u:
away, he hath thought to make himself a King and aruler owe
us, that he may do with us according to his will and pleasure.
