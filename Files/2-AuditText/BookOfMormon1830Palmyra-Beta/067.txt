red afflictions and much sorrow, because of the rudeness of
thy brethren. Nevertheles, Jacob, my first born in the wil
derness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shell con-
secrate thine afllictions for thy gain. Wherefore, thy soul shall
be blessed, and thou shalt dwell safely with thy brother, Ne-
phi; and thy days shall be speut in the service of thy Godâ€”
Wherefure, I know that thou art reedcemied, because of the
righteousness of thy Redeemer: for thou hast beheld, that in
the fulness of time, he cometh to bring salvation unto men,
And thou hast beheld in thy youth, his glory ; wherefore, {how
art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the
flesh: for the spirit is the same, yesterday, to-day, and for-
