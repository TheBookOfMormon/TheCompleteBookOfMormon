they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him, as it
they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them. And
he saith unto them, Behold, my bowels is filled with compas-
sion towards you: Have ye any that are sick among you, bring
themhither. Iave ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or
maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or
that are afflicted in any manner, bring them hither, and I will
heal them: for I have compassion upon you; my bowels is
filled with mercy: for ] perceive that ye desire that [ should
