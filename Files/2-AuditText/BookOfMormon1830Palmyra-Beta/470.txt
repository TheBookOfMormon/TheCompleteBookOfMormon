ninth year, there began to be some disputings among the peo
ple; and some were lifted up unto pride and boastings, he.
cause of their excecding great riches, yea, even unto great
persecutions :, for there were many merchants in the land, and
also many lawyers, and many officers. And the people began
to be distinguished by ranks, according to their riches, and
their chances forlearning ; yea, some were ignorant because of
their poverty, and others did receive great learning because af
their riches; some were lifled up in pride, and others wer
exceeding humble; some did return railing for railing, while
others would receive railing, and persecution, and all manner
of afflictions, and would not turn and revile again, but were
humble and penitent before God; and thus there became a
