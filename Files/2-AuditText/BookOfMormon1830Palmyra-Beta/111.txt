@ the pain, and the anguish of my soul for’ the loss of the
glain of my people! For i, Nephi, hath seen it, and it well
nigh cousumeth me before the presence of the Lord; but 1
must cry unto my God, thy ways are just. But behold, the
righteous, that hearken unto the words of the prophets, and
destroy them not, but look forward unto Christ with steadfast-
ness for the signs which are given, notwithstanding all perse-
cations; behold they are they which’ shall not perish. ‘But
the Sen of righteousness shall appear unto them ; and he
shall heal them, and they shall have peace with him, until
