to obtain the city of Manti ; but behold, there was no way thai
we could them out of the city, by our small bands, For
behold, they remembered that which we had hitherto done;
therefore we could not decoy them away from their strong
holds ; and they were so exceedmg more pumerous than was
our army, that we durst not go forth and attack them in their
strong holds. Yea, and it became expdient that we should
employ our men, to the maintaining those parts of the land,
of the which we had retained of our possessions; therefore it
became expedient that we should wait, that we might receive
more strength from the land of Zarahemla, and also a new
supply of provisions.

And it came to pass that I thus did send an embassy to the
governor of our Jand, to acquaint him concerning the affairs of
our people. And it came to pass that we did wait to receive

rovisions and strength, from the land of Zarahemla. Butbe:

also receiving great strength, {rom day to day, and alse many

we did receive food, which was guarded to us by an army

tend with an enemy which was innumerable. And now fhe
cause of these our embarrassments, or the cause why they did
not send more strength unto us, we knew not; therefore we
were grieved, and also filled with fear, lest by any means the
judgements of God should come upon our land, te our ove
throw and utter destruction; therefore we did pour out oll
souls in prayer to God, that he would strengthen us and der
yer us out of the hands of our enemies ; yea, and also give
strength, that we might retain our cities, and our Janis, 40!
our possessions, for the support of our people, Yea, andi
came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with asi
ances, that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he did
speak peace to our souls, and did grant unto us as great faith,
