: CHAPTER XU

And now, as T said unto you, that after king Mosiah had
done these things, he took the plates of brass, and ail the things
which he had kept, and conferred them u pon Almia, which was
the son of Alma; yea, all the records, and also the interpre-
ters, and conferred them upon bim, and commanding bim that
he should keep and preserve them, and also keep a record of
the peopte, handing them down from one generation to another,
even as they had been handed down from the time that Lehi
left ferusatem. Now when Mosieh had done this, he sent out
throughoui al] the land, among all the people, desiring to know
their will concerning who should be their king. And it came
to pass that the voice of the people came, saying: We are de-
sirous that Aaron, thy son, should be our king, and our ruler.
Now Aaron had gone up to the land of Nephi, therefore the
king could not confer the kingdom upon him; neither would
Aaron take upon him the kingdom; neither was any of the
sons of Mosiah willing to take upon them the kingdom ; there-
fore king Mosiah sent again among the people, yea, even a

Wilten word sent he among the people. And these were the |

words that were written, saying: Behold, O ye my people, or
ny brethren, for l esteem you as such; for I desire that ye
should consider the cause which ye are called to consider; for
Yeare desirous to have a king. “Now f declare unto you, that
leto whom the kingdom doth uightly belons, hath declined,
and will not take upon him the kingdom. And now if there
Swould be another appointed in his stead, behold I fear there
would rise contentions among you; and who knoweth but
whet my son, to whom the kingdom doth belong, should turn
tohe angry, and draw away a part of this people after him,
Which would cause wars and contentions among you; which
would be the cause of shedding much blood, and perverting
the way of the Lord's yea, and destroy the souls of much peo~
ple, Now I say unto you, let us be wise and consider these
things, for we have no right to destray my son, neitlier should
We have any right to destroy another, if he should be appointed
Iniis stead, And if my son should turn again to his pride and
Vaio things, he would recall the things which he had said, and
chim his right to the kingdom, which would cause him and

80 this people to commit much sin. And now let us be wise,
andlook forward to these things, and do that which will make
or the peace of this people... Therefore £ will be your king
