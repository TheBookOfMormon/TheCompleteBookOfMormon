Now Nephi began to be old, and he saw that he must S004

over his people now, according to the reigns of the kings
The people having loved Nephi exceedingly, he having beeny
grcat protector for them, having wielded the sword of Lab
in their defence, and having lahoured in all his days for thep

And it came to pass that Nephi died. Now the people which
were not Lamaniies, were Nephites; nevertheless, they wer
ealled Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, Zoramites, Lamanites,
Lemuelites, and Ishmaehites, But I, Jacob, shall not hereat.

they which are friendly to Nephi, I shall call Nephites, or tle
people of Nephi, according to the reigns of the kings.

hearts, and indulge themselves somewhat in wicked practices,
such as like unto David of Old desiring many wives and com

somewhat in pride; wherefore, I, Jacob, gave unto them thes
words as J taught them in the temple, having firstly obtained
mine errand from the Lord. Yor |, Jacob, and my brother
Joseph, had becn consecrated priests, and teachers of this
people, by the hand of Nephi, And we did magnify our ofhe

the sins of the people upon our own heads, if we did no:
teach them the word of God with all diligence; wherefore, by
laboring with our mights, their blood might not come upon olt
garments; otherwise, their blood would come Upon our gar
ments, and we would not be found spotless at the last day.
