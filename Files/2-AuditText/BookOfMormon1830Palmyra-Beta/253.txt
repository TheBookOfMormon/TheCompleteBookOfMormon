said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I
mistake, for T have seen much of his mysteries and his mar~
yellous power; yea, even in the preservation of the lives. of
this people; neverthelese, I did harden my heart, for I was
called many tines, and I would not hear; therefore } knew
concerning these things, yet { would not know; therefore
went on rebelling against God, in the wickedness of my heart,
even uniil the fourth day of this seventh month, which is m
the tenth year of the reign of our Judges. As Iwas a jour-
neying to see a very near kindred, behold an angel of the Lord
appeared unto me, and said, Amulek, return to thine own
house, for thou shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea, a holy”
