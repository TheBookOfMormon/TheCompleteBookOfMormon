loved brethren, I, Jacob, according to the responsibility which
Lam wider to Ged, to magnify imine office with soberness, and
that [ might rid my garments of your sins, I come up into the
temple this day, that I might declare unto you the word of God;
and ye yourselves know, that 1 have hitherto been diligent in
the ofice of my calling; but f this day am weighed down with
much more desive and anxiety for the welfare of your souls,
than ] have hitherto been, Tor behold, as yet, ye have been
obedient unto the word of the Lord, which Ihave given unto
you. But behold, hearken ye unto me, and know that by the
help of the All-powertul Creator of Heaven and Earth, 1 can
tell you congerning your thoughts, how that ye are beginning ta
labor in sin, which sin appeareth very abominable unto me,
yea, and abominable unto Ged. Yea, it grieveth my soul and

delicate minds. But, notwithstanding the greatness of the task,
Imuat do according to the strict commands of God, and tell
you concerning your wickeduess and abominations, in the pre-

glance of the piercing eye of the Almighty God.

Wherefore, 1 must tell you the trath, according to the plaine
ness of the word of God. Tor behold, as 1 inquired of the
Lord, thus came the word unto me, saying, Jacob; get thou
up into the temple on the morrow, and declare the word which
ishall give thee, unto this people. â€˜s

And now behold, my brethren, this is the word which I de-
