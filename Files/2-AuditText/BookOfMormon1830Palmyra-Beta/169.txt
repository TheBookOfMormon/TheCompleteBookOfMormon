God, to whom also, your life belongeth; and yet ye put up no

etition, or repenteth not of the thing which thou hast done.—
Tsay uuto you, Wo be unto that man, for his substance shall
perish with him ; and now, I say these things unto those which
are rich, as pertaining to the things of this world. And again,
T say unto the poor, ye that have not and yet hath sufficient,
that ye remain from day to day; I mean all you that deny the
beggar, because ye have not; 1 would that ye say in your
hearts, that I give not because I have not; but if I had, I would

ye may commit sin: for there are divers ways and means,
even so many, that I cannot number them. But this much I
can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your
thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe to keep
the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what
ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto
the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, re
