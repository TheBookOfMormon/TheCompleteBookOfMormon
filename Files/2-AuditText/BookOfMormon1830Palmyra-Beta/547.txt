in them. Behold, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that we shall cross
{his great water in darkness? And the Lord said unto the
brother of Jared, What will ye that I should do that ye may
have light in your vessels? For behold, ye cannot have win-
dows, for they will be dashed in pieces ; neither shall ye take
fire with you, for ye shall not go by the light of fire: for be-
hold, ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea; for the
mountain waves shall dash upon you. Nevertheless, I will
bring you up again out of the depths of the sea: for the winds
have gone forth out of my mouth, and also the rains and the
floods have 1 sent forth. And behold, I prepare you against
