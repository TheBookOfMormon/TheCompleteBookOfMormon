ople of that city. But behold, to their astonishment, the city
a Noah, which had hitherio been a weak place, had now, by
te means of Moroni, become strong ; yea, even to excced the
grength of the city Ammonihah. And now behold, this was
yisdom in Moroni; for he had supposed that they would he
fightened at the city Ammonihah; and as the city of Noah
tad hitherto been the weakest part of the land, therefore they
would march thither to battle; and thus it was, according to
tisdesires. And behold, Moroni had appointed Lehi to be
Chief Captain over the men of that city; and it was that same
