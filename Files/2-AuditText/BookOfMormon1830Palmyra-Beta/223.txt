he enacteth laws, and sendeth them forth among his people ;
yea, baws after the manner of his own wickedness: and who-
soeyer doth not obey his laws, he causeth to be destroyed ;
ad whosoever doth rebel against him, he will send his armies
wainst them to war, and if he can, he will destroy them: and
tus an unrighteous king doth pervert the ways ofall right-
eousness. And now behold [ say unto you, It is not expedi-
at that such abominations should come upon you; therefore
choose you by the voice of this people, judges, that ye may
be judged according to the laws which hath been given you
by our fathers, which are correct, and which was giver them

uns and iniquities, they shall be answered upon their own

lave been caused by the iniquities of their kings; therefore
theiy iniquities are answered upon the heads of their kings.
And now I desire that. this inequality should be no more in
this land, especially among this my people ; but 1 desire that
â€˜his land be a land of liberty, and every man may enjoy his
ghis aud privileges alike, so long as the Lord seeth fit, that
We may live and inherit the land; yea, even as long as any of
Sur posterity remaineth upon the face ofthe land. And many
