ane Messiah spoken of by the Prophets, and that Messiah is
he which should be rejected of the Jews. For according to
the words of the Prophets, the Messiah cometh in six bun-
dren years fromthe tine that my father Jeft Jerusalem; and ac-
cording to the words of the Prophets, and also the word of
the Angel of God, his name shall be Jesus Christ the Son of God.

And now my brethren, | have spoken plain, that ye cannot
err; and as the Lord God liveth, that brought Israel up out ef the
jand of Exypt, and gave unto Moses power that he should heal
the nations, after that they had been bitten by the poisonous
serpents, if they would cast their eyes unto the serpent which
he did raise. up before them, and elso gaye him power that he
should smite the rock, and the water should come forth; yea,
behold | say unto ypu that as these things are rue, and as
the Lord God liveth, there is none other name given under
heaven, save it be this Jesus Christ of which I have spoken,
whereby man can be saved. *

Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised un-
to me that these things which | write, shalkbe kept and pre-
served, and handed down unto my seed, from generation to
generation, that the promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that
his seed should never perish as long as the earth should stand,
Wherefore, these things shal) go from. generation to generation,
as long as the earth shall stand; and they shall go according
to the will and pleasure of God ; and the nations which skall
possess them, shall be judged of them according to the words
which are written; for we labor diligently to write, to per-
suade our children, and also our brethren, to belicve in Christ,
and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace
that we are saved, after all that we can do,

And notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law
of Moses, and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, un-
tithe law shalt be fulfilled; for, for this end was the law
given; wherefore, the law hath become dead unto us, and we
are made alive in Christ, because of our faith; yet, we keep
the law because of the commandments ; and we talk of Christ,
we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of
Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our
children may know to what source they may look for a remis-
sion of their sins, Wherefore, we speak concerning the law,
that our children may know the deadness of the law; and
they, by knowing the deadnes of the law, may look forward un-
% that life which is in Christ, and know for what end the law:
