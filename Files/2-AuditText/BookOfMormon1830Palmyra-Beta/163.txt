there is a Wo pronounced upon him who listeth to obey, that
epinit; for if he listeth to obey him, and renaineth and dieth
in his sins, the same drinketh damnation to his own soul; for
he receiveth for his wages an everlasting punishment, having
transgressed the law of God, contrary to his own. knowledge.
I say unto you, thatibere are not.one among you, except it be
your little children, that have not been taught concerning these
things 5 but what knoweth that ye are eternally indebted to
your Heavenly Father, torendcr to him ullthatyou have, and
are, and also have been taught, concerning the records which
contain the prophecies which hath been spoken hy the Holy
Prophets, even down to the time our father Lehi left Jerusa-
lem; and also, ali that hath been spoken by our fathers, until

And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have

ofthe Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and
anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flames as-
eendeth up forever and ever, And now I say unto you, that
uercy hath no claim on that man; therefore, bis final doom is
to endure a never ending torment.

O all ye old men, and also ye young men, and you little
children, which can understand my words, (fer I have spoken
plain unto you, that ye might understand,) I pray that ye should
awake 10 a remembrance of the awful situation of thoze that
have fallen into transgresston; and moreover, | would, desire-
that ye should consider on the bles and happy state of
those that keep the commandments of God. for beheld,
they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual ; and’

itthey hold out faithful to the end, they are received into Hea-
