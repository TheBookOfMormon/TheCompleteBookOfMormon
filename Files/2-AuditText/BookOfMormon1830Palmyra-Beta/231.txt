heing as humerous almost, as it were, as the sands of the sea,
came upon them to destroy them; nevertheless the Nephites,
being strengthened by the hand of the Lord, haying prayed
mighiily to him that he would deliver them out of the hands of
thew enemies; therefore the Lord did hear their cries, and
did strengthen them, and the Lamanites and the Anulicites did
fall before them. And it came to pass that A] fought with
Awlici with the sword, face to face; and t ey did contend
mightily, one with another,

And it came to pass that Alma, he being a man of God, be~
ing exercised with much faith, and he cried, saying, O Lord,
haye mercy and spare my life, that I may be an jnsirument in
thy hands, to save and_ preserve this people. Now when Al-
nahad seid these words, he contended again with Amlici; and
he was strengthened, insomuch that he slew Amlici with the
