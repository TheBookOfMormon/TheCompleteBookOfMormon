taken the capital city, which was the city of Zarahemla, ay
were marching through the most capital parts of the land, sly,
ing the-people witha great slaughter, both men, women
children, taking possession of many cities and of many
holds. But when Movonihah had discovered this, he imme),
ately sent forth Lehi with an army round about to head
before they should come to the land Bountiful: And thus)
