then, to declare unto them concerning, their iniquities ; and
the blood of those which they murdered, did cry unto the
Jord their God, tor vengeance upon those which were their
murderers; and thus the judgments of God did come upon
these workers of darkness and sceret combinations; yea, and

And now my soa, remember the words which I have spo-

yea, let thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the
atlections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever; coun-

iathe may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou ri-
sst in the morning, let thy heart be full of thanks unto God ;
and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.

it was prepared to shew unto our fathers the course which
they should travel in the wilderness; and it did work for
them according to their faith in God; therefore if they had
faith to believe that God could cause that those spindles should
