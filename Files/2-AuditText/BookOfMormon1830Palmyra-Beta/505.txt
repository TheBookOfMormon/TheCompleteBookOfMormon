 

CHAPTER X.

Bur if they will repent, and hearken unto my words, and
harden not their hearts, I will establish my church among
them, and they shall come in unto the covenant, and be num-
bered among this the remnant of Jacob, unto whom 1 have
given this land for their inheritance, and they shall assist my
people, the remant of Jacob; and also, as many of the house

of Israel as shall come, that they may build a city, which shall ”

be called the New Jerusalem; and then shall they assist my
people that they may be gathered in, which are scattered upon
all the face of the land, in unto the New Jerusalem. And then
shall the power of heaven come down among them; and T
also will be in the midst: and then shall the work of the Fa-
ther commence, at that day even when this Gospel shall be
preached among the remnant of this people. Verily, 1 say
unto you, At that day shall the work of the Father commence

among all the dispersed of my people; yea, even the tribes

which have been lost, which the Father hath led away out of
Jerusalem. Yea, the work shall commence among all the dis-
persed of my people, with the Father, to prepare the way
whereby they may come unto me, that they may call on the
Father in my name; yea, and then shall the work commence,
with the Father, among all nations, in preparing the way
wherchy his people may be gathered home to the land of their
inheritance. And they shall go out from all nations ; and they
shall not go out in haste, nor go by flight: for I will go before
them, saith the Father, and I will be their rereward. And then
shall that which is written come to pass, Sing, O barren,
thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry
aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the
children of the desolate than the children of the married wife,
saith the Lord, Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them
stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations ; spare not, length-
en thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes ; for thou shalt break:

forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall in- °

herit the Gentiles;and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
Fear not; for taou shalt not be ashamed : neither be thoucon-
founded: for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt
forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the re-
_ proach of thy widowhood any more. For thy Maker, thy
husband, The Lord of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer,
the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he
