tions, according to the word which he hath spoken.—
Wherefore hearken, O my people, which are of the House
of Israel, and give ear unto my words: for because ‘that
the words of Isaiah are not plain unto you, nevertheless
they are plain unto all they that are filled with the spirit of
propheey. But I give unto you a prophecy, according to the
spirit which is in me 5 wherefore I shall prophesy according
to the plainness which hath been with me from the time that.
Icame out from Jerugalem with my father: for behold, my
soul delighteth in plainness unto my people, that they may
jearn; yea, and my soul deligiteth in the words of Isaiah, for
