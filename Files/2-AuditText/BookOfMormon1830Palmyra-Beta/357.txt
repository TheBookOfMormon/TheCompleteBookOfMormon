whey would stir up the Lamanites to anger against them, and
cause them to come to battle against them; and this he knew
that Amalickiah would do, that he might obtain his purposes ;
therefore Moroni thought it was expedient that he should take
his armies, which had gathered themselves together, and armed
themselves, und entered into a covcnant io keep the peace :—
‘And it came to pass that he took his army, and marched out
info the wilderness, to cut off the course of Amalickiah in the
wilderness.

And it came to pass that he did according to his desires, and
marched forth into the wilderness, and headed the armies of
Amalickiah. And it came to pass that Amalickiah fled with a
small number of his men, and the remainder were delivered up
into the bands of Moroni, and were taken back into the land
of Zarahemla, Now Moroni being a man which was appoint-
ail hy the Chief Judges and the voice of the people, therefore
fe had power according to his will, with the armies of the
Nephites, to establish and to exercise authority over them.

And it came 10 pass that whomsoever of the Amalickiahites
that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of
freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused
to be put to death; and there was but few which denied the
covenant of freedom.

And it came to pass also, that he caused the title of liberty
fo be hoisted upon every tower which was in all the Jand,
which was possessed by the Nephites; and thus Moroni plant-
td the standard of liberty among the Nephites. And they be-
san to have peace again in the land; and thus they did main-
iain peace in the land, Wntil nearly the end of the nineteenth
year of the reign of the Judges. And Helaman and the High
Priests did also maintain onder in the church; yea, even for
the space of four years, did they have much peace and rejoi-
¢ing in the church. eer

And it came to pass that there were many who died, firmly
believing that their souls were redeemed by the Lord Jesus
Christ; thus they went out of the world rejoicing. And there _
Were some who died with fevers, which at some scasotis of
the year, was very frequent in the land; but not so much so
with fevers, because of the excellent qualities of the many
plants and roots which God had prepared, to remove the
cause of discases which was subsequent to man, by the nature
Othe clhnate. But there were many who died with old age ;
wid those who died in the faith of Christ, are happy in him,
