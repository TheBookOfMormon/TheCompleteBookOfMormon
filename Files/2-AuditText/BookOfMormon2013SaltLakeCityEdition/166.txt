the beggar, because ye have not; I
would that ye say in your hearts
that: lgive not because I have not,
but if I had I would give.

25 And now, if ye say this in your
hearts ye remain guiltless, other-
wise ye are condemned; and your
condemnation is just for ye covet
that which ye have not received.

26 And now, for the sake of these
things which I have spoken unto
you.that is, for the sake of retain-
ing a remission of your sins from
day to day, that ye may walk guilt-
less before God.I would that ye
should impart of your substance
to the poor, every man accord-
ing to that which he hath, such as
feeding the hungry, clothing the
naked, visiting the sick and admin-
istering to their relief, both spiri-
tually and temporally, according to
their wants.

27 And see that all these things are
done in wisdom and order; for it
is not requisite that a man should
run faster than he has strength.
And again, it is expedient that he
should be diligent, that thereby he
might win the prize; therefore, all
things must be done in order.

28 And I would that ye should
remember, that whosoever among
you borroweth of his neighbor
should return the thing that he
borroweth, according as he doth
agree, or else thou shalt commit
sin; and perhaps thou shalt cause
thy neighbor to commit sin also.

29 And finally, I cannot tell you all
the things whereby ye may commit
sin; for there are divers ways and
means, even so many that I cannot
number them.

 

30 But this much I can tell you, that
if ye do not watch yourselves, and
your thoughts, and your words,
and your deeds, and observe the com-
mandments of God, and continue
in the faith of what ye have heard
concerning the coming of our Lord,
even unto the end of your lives,
ye must perish. And now, O man,
remember, and perish not.

CHAPTER 5

The Saints become the sons and daugh-
ters of Christ through faith.They are
then called by the name of Christ.King
Benjamin exhorts them to be steadfast
and immovable in good works. About
124 B.C.

AND now, it came to pass that when
king Benjamin had thus spoken to
his people, he sent among them,
desiring to know of his people if
they believed the words which he
had spoken unto them.

2 And they all cried with one voice,
saying: Yea, we believe all the words
which thou hast spoken unto us;
and also, we know of their surety
and truth, because of the Spirit of
the Lord Omnipotent, which has
wrought a mighty change in us,
or in our hearts, that we have no
more disposition to do evil, but to
do good continually.

3 And we, ourselves, also, through
the infinite goodness of God, and
the manifestations of his Spirit,
have great views of that which is
to come; and were it expedient, we
could prophesy of all things.

4 And it is the faith which we have
had on the things which our king
has spoken unto us that has brought
