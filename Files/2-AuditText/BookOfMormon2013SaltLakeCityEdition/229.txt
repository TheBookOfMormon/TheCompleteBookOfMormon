27 Have ye walked, keeping your-
selves blameless before God? Could
ye say, if ye were called to die at this
time, within yourselves, that ye have
been sufficiently humble? That
your garments have been cleansed
and made white through the blood
of Christ, who will come to redeem
his people from their sins?

28 Behold, are ye stripped of pride?
I say unto you, if ye are not ye are
not prepared to meet God. Behold ye
must prepare quickly; for the king-
dom of heaven is soon at hand, and
such an one hath not eternal life.

29 Behold, I say, is there one among
you who is not stripped of envy? L
say unto you that such an one is not
prepared; and I would that he should
prepare quickly, for the hour is
close at hand, and he knoweth not
when the time shall come; for such
an one is not found guiltless.

30 And again I say unto you, is
there one among you that doth
make a mock of his brother, or that
heapeth upon him persecutions?

31 Wo unto such an one, for he
is not prepared, and the time is
at hand that he must repent or he
cannot be saved!

32 Yea, even wo unto all ye work-
ers of iniquity; repent, repent, for
the Lord God hath spoken it!

33 Behold, he sendeth an invita-
tion unto Zall men, for the arms of
mercy are extended towards them,
and he saith: Repent, and I will
receive you.

 

34 Yea, he saith: Come unto me
and ye shall partake of the fruit
of the tree of life; yea, ye shall eat
and drink of the bread and the
waters of life freely;

35 Yea, come unto me and bring
forth works of righteousness, and
ye shall not be hewn down and cast
into the fire.

36 For behold, the time is at hand
that whosoever bringeth forth
not good fruit, or whosoever do-
eth not the works of righteousness,
the same have cause to wail and
mourn.

37 O ye workers of iniquity; ye that
are puffed up in the vain things of
the world, ye that have professed
to have known the ways of righ-
teousness nevertheless have gone
â€™astray, as sheep having no shep-
herd, notwithstanding a shepherd
hath called after you and is still
calling after you, but ye will not
fhearken unto his voice!

38 Behold, I say unto you, that the
good shepherd doth call you; yea,
and in his own name he doth call
you, which is the name of Christ;
and if ye will not hearken unto
the voice of the good shepherd, to
the name by which ye are called,
behold, ye are not the sheep of the
good shepherd.

39 And now if ye are not the sheep
of the good shepherd, of what fold
are ye? Behold, I say unto you,
that the devil is your shepherd,
and ye are of his fold; and now,
