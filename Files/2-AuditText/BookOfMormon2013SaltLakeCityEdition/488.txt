7 And it came to pass that my peo-
ple, with their wives and their chil-
dren, did now behold the armies
of the Lamanites marching towards
them; and with that awful fear of
death which fills the breasts of all
the wicked, did they await to re-
ceive them.

8 And it came to pass that they
came to battle against us, and every
soul was filled with terror because
of the greatness of their numbers.

9 And it came to pass that they
did fall upon my people with the
sword, and with the bow, and with
the arrow, and with the ax, and with
all manner of weapons of war.

10 And it came to pass that my men
were hewn down, yea, even my ten
thousand who were with me, and L
fell wounded in the midst; and they
passed by me that they did not put
an end to my life.

11 And when they had gone through
and hewn down 4all my people save
it were twenty and four of us, (among
whom was my son Moroni) and
we having survived the dead of our
people, did behold on the morrow,
when the Lamanites had returned
unto their camps, from the top of
the hill Cumorah, the ten thousand
of my people who were hewn down,
being led in the front by me.

12 And we also beheld the ten
thousand of my people who were
led by my son Moroni.

13 And behold, the ten thousand
of Gidgiddonah had fallen, and he
also in the midst.

14 And Lamah had fallen with his
ten thousand; and Gilgal had fallen
with his ten thousand; and Lim-
hah had fallen with his ten thou-
sand; and Jeneum had fallen with
his ten thousand; and Cumenihah,
and Moronihah, and Antionum,
and Shiblom, and Shem, and Josh,

 

had fallen with their ten thousand
each.

15 And it came to pass that there
were ten more who did fall by the
sword, with their ten thousand each;
yea, even all my people, save it were
those twenty and four who were
with me, and also a few who had
escaped into the south countries,
and a few who had deserted over
unto the Lamanites, had fallen; and
their flesh, and bones, and blood
lay upon the face of the earth, being
left by the hands of those who slew
them to molder upon the land, and
to crumble and to return to their
mother earth.

16 And my soul was rent with 7an-
guish, because of the slain of my
people, and I cried:

17 O ye fair ones, how could ye
have departed from the ways of the
Lord! O ye fair ones, how could ye
have rejected that Jesus, who stood
with open arms to receive you!

18 Behold, if ye had not done this,
ye would not have fallen. But behold,
ye are fallen, and [mourn your loss.

19 O ye fair sons and daughters,
ye fathers and mothers, ye husbands
and wives, ye fair ones, how is it
that ye could have fallen!

20 But behold, ye are gone, and my
sorrows cannot bring your return.

21 And the day soon cometh that
your mortal must put on immor-
tality, and these bodies which are
now moldering in corruption must
soon become incorruptible bodies;
and then ye must stand before
the judgment-seat of Christ, to be
judged according to your works;
and if it so be that ye are righteous,
then are ye blessed with your fathers
who have gone before you.

22 O that ye had repented before
this great destruction had come
upon you. But behold, ye are gone,
