that those who committed sin, that
were in the church, should be ad-
monished by the church.

7 And it came to pass that they
were brought before the priests, and
delivered up unto the priests by
the teachers; and the priests brought
them before Alma, who was the
high priest.

8 Now king Mosiah had given Alma
the authority over the church.

9 And it came to pass that Alma
did not know concerning them;
but there were many witnesses
against them; yea, the people stood
and testified of their iniquity in
abundance.

10 Now there had not any such
thing happened before in the
church; therefore Alma was trou-
bled in his spirit, and he caused that
they should be brought before the
king.

11 And he said unto the king:
Behold, here are many whom we
have brought before thee, who are
accused of their brethren; yea, and
they have been taken in divers in-
iquities. And they do not repent of
their iniquities; therefore we have
brought them before thee, that thou
mayest judge them according to
their crimes.

12 But king Mosiah said unto Alma:
Behold, I judge them not; therefore
I deliver them into thy hands to
be judged.

13 And now the spirit of Alma was
again troubled; and he went and in-
quired of the Lord what he should
do concerning this matter, for he
feared that he should do wrong in
the sight of God.

14 And it came to pass that after

 

he had poured out his whole soul
to God, the voice of the Lord came
to him, saying:

15 Blessed art thou, Alma, and
blessed are they who were baptized
in the waters of Mormon. Thou art
blessed because of thy exceeding
faith in the words alone of my
servant Abinadi.

16 And blessed are they because of
their exceeding faith in the words
alone which thou hast spoken unto
them.

17 And blessed art thou because
thou hast established a church
among this people; and they shall
be established, and they shall be
my people.

18 Yea, blessed is this people who
are willing to bear my name; for
in my name shall they be called;
and they are mine.

19 And because thou hast inquired
of me concerning the transgressor,
thou art blessed.

20 Thou art my servant; and I cov-
enant with thee that thou shalt have
eternal life; and thou shalt serve
me and go forth in my name, and
shalt gather together my sheep.

21 And he that will hear my voice
shall be my sheep; and him shall
ye receive into the church, and him
will I also receive.

22 For behold, this is my church;
whosoever is baptized shall be bap-
tized unto repentance. And whom-
soever ye receive shall believe in
my name; and him will I freely
forgive.

23 For it is I that taketh upon me
the sins of the world; for it is  that
hath created them; and it is I that
granteth unto him that believeth
