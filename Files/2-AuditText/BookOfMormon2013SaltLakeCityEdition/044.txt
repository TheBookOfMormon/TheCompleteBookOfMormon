even that they did murmur against
the Lord.

21 Now it came to pass that I,
Nephi, having been afflicted with
my brethren because of the loss of
my bow, and their bows having lost
their springs, it began to be exceed-
ingly difficult, yea, insomuch that
we could obtain no food.

22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,
did speak much unto my breth-
ren, because they had hardened
their hearts again, even unto com-
plaining against the Lord their God.

23 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, did make out of wood a
bow, and out of a straight stick, an
arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself
with a bow and an arrow, with a
sling and with stones. And I said
unto my father: Whither shall 1 go
to obtain food?

24 And it came to pass that he did
inquire of the Lord, for they had
humbled themselves because of
my words; for I did say many things
unto them in the energy of my soul.

25 And it came to pass that the
voice of the Lord came unto my
father; and he was truly chastened
because of his murmuring against
the Lord, insomuch that he was
brought down into the depths of
sorrow.

26 And it came to pass that the
voice of the Lord said unto him:
Look upon the ball, and behold the
things which are written.

27 And it came to pass that when
my father beheld the things which
were written upon the ball, he did
fear and tremble exceedingly, and
also my brethren and the sons of
Ishmael and our wives.

 

28 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,
beheld the pointers which were in
the ball, that they did work accord-
ing to the faith and diligence and
heed which we did give unto them.

29 And there was also written
upon them a new writing, which
was plain to be read, which did give
us understanding concerning the
ways of the Lord; and it was writ-
ten and changed from time to time,
according to the faith and diligence
which we gave unto it. And thus we
see that by small means the Lord
can bring about great things.

30 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, did go forth up into the top
of the mountain, according to the
directions which were given upon
the ball.

31 And it came to pass that I did
slay wild beasts, insomuch that I
did obtain food for our families.

32 And it came to pass that I did
return to our tents, bearing the
beasts which I had slain; and now
when they beheld that I had ob-
tained food, how great was their
joy! And it came to pass that they
did humble themselves before the
Lord, and did give thanks unto him.

33 And it came to pass that we did
again take our journey, traveling
nearly the same course as in the
beginning; and after we had trav-
eled for the space of many days we
did pitch our tents again, that we
might tarry for the space of a time.

34 And it came to pass that Ish-
mael died, and was buried in the
place which was called Nahom.

35 And it came to pass that the
daughters of Ishmael did mourn
exceedingly, because of the loss of
