and his statutes, according to the
law of Moses.

10 Neither would they observe
the performances of the church,
to continue in prayer and suppli-
cation to God daily, that they might
not enter into temptation.

11 Yea, in fine, they did pervert
the ways of the Lord in very many
instances; therefore, for this cause,
Alma and his brethren went into
the land to preach the word unto
them.

12 Now, when they had come into
the land, behold, to their astonish-
ment they found that the Zoram-
ites had built synagogues, and that
they did gather themselves together
on one day of the week, which day
they did call the day of the Lord;
and they did worship after a man-
ner which Alma and his brethren
had never beheld;

13 For they had a place built up
in the center of their synagogue, a
place for standing, which was high
above the head; and the top thereof
would only admit one person.

14 Therefore, whosoever desired to
worship must go forth and stand
upon the top thereof, and stretch
forth his hands towards heaven,
and cry with a loud voice, saying:

15 Holy, holy God; we believe that
thou art God, and we believe
that thou art holy, and that thou
wast a spirit, and that thou arta
spirit, and that thou wilt be a spirit
forever.

16 Holy God, we believe that thou
hast separated us from our breth-
ren; and we do not believe in the
tradition of our brethren, which
was handed down to them by the
childishness of their fathers; but we
believe that thou hast elected us
to be thy holy children; and also
thou hast made it known unto us
that there shall be no Christ.

 

17 But thou art the same yesterday,
today, and forever; and thou hast
elected us that we shall be saved,
whilst all around us are elected to
be cast by thy wrath down to hell;
for the which holiness, O God,
we thank thee; and we also thank
thee that thou hast elected us, that
we may not be led away after the
foolish traditions of our brethren,
which doth bind them down to a
belief of Christ, which doth lead
their hearts to wander far from thee,
our God.

18 And again we thank thee, O
God, that we are a chosen and a
holy people. Amen.

19 Now it came to pass that after
Alma and his brethren and his sons
had heard these prayers, they were
astonished beyond all measure.

20 For behold, every man did
go forth and offer up these same
prayers.

21 Now the place was called by
them Rameumptom, which, being
interpreted, is the holy stand.

22 Now, from this stand they did
offer up, every man, the selfsame
prayer unto God, thanking their
God that they were chosen of him,
and that he did not lead them away
after the tradition of their brethren,
and that their hearts were not stolen
away to believe in things to come,
which they knew nothing about.

23 Now, after the people had all
offered up thanks after this man-
ner, they returned to their homes,
never speaking of their God again
until they had assembled themselves
together again to the holy stand, to
offer up thanks after their manner.

24 Now when Alma saw this his
heart was grieved; for he saw that
they were a wicked and a perverse
people; yea, he saw that their hearts
were set upon gold, and upon silver,
and upon all manner of fine goods.
