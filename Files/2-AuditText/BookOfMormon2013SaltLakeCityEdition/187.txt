they shall see eye to eye, when the
Lord shall bring again Zion.

30 Break forth into joy, sing to-
gether, ye waste places of Jerusalem;
for the Lord hath comforted his peo-
ple, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.

31 The Lord hath made bare his

holy arm in the eyes of all the na-
tions; and all the ends of the earth
shall see the salvation of our God.

CHAPTER 16

God redeems men from their lost and
fallen state.Those who are carnal
remain as though there were no re-
demption.Christ brings to pass a res-
urrection to endless life or to endless
damnation. About 148 B.c.

AND now, it came to pass that after
Abinadi had spoken these words he
stretched forth his hand and said:
The time shall come when all shall
see the salvation of the Lord; when
’every nation, kindred, tongue, and
people shall see eye to eye and shall
confess before God that his judg-
ments are just.

2 And then shall the wicked be
’cast out, and they shall have cause
to howl, and weep, and wail, and
gnash their teeth; and this because
they would not hearken unto the
voice of the Lord; therefore the Lord
redeemeth them not.

3 For they are carnal and devilish,
and the devil has power over them;
yea, even that old serpent that did

 

beguile our first parents, which was
the cause of their fall; which
was the cause of all mankind be-
coming carnal, sensual, devilish,
knowing evil from good, subject-
ing themselves to the devil.

4 Thus all mankind were lost;
and behold, they would have been
endlessly lost were it not that God
redeemed his people from their lost
and fallen state.

5 But remember that he that per-
sists in his own carnal nature, and
goes on in the ways of sin and re-
bellion against God, remaineth in
his fallen state and the devil hath
all power over him. Therefore he
is as though there was no redemp-
tion made, being an enemy to God;
and also is the 4devil an enemy
to God.

6 And now if Christ had not come
into the world, speaking of things to
come as though they had already
come, there could have been no
redemption.

7 And if Christ had not risen from
the dead, or have broken the bands
of death that the grave should have
no victory, and that death should
have no 4sting, there could have
been no resurrection.

8 But there is a resurrection, there-
fore the grave hath no victory, and
the sting of death is swallowed
up in Christ.

9 He is the light and the life of the
world; yea, a light that is endless,
