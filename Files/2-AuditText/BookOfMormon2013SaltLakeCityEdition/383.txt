church and were baptized unto
repentance.

25 And so great was the prosper-
ity of the church, and so many the
blessings which were poured out
upon the people, that even the high
priests and the teachers were them-
selves astonished beyond measure.

26 And it came to pass that the
work of the Lord did prosper unto
the baptizing and uniting to the
church of God, many souls, yea,
even tens of thousands.

27 Thus we may see that the Lord
is merciful unto all who will, in the
sincerity of their hearts, call upon
his holy name.

28 Yea, thus we see that the gate
of heaven is open unto Â®all, even to
those who will believe on the name
of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God.

29 Yea, we see that whosoever
will may lay hold upon the word
of God, which is quick and pow-
erful, which shall divide asunder
all the cunning and the snares and
the wiles of the devil, and lead the
man of Christ in a strait and nar-
row course across that everlasting
gulf of misery which is prepared
to engulf the wicked.

30 And land their souls, yea, their
immortal souls, at the right hand
of God in the kingdom of heaven,
to sit down with Abraham, and
Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all
our holy fathers, to go no more out.

31 And in this year there was con-
tinual rejoicing in the land of Zara-
hemla, and in all the regions round
about, even in all the land which
was possessed by the Nephites.

32 And it came to pass that there
was peace and exceedingly great
joy in the remainder of the forty

 

and ninth year; yea, and also there
was continual peace and great joy
in the fiftieth year of the reign of
the judges.

33 And in the fifty and first year
of the reign of the judges there
was peace also, save it were the
pride which began to enter into the
church.not into the church of God,
but into the hearts of the people
who professed to belong to the
church of God.

34 And they were lifted up in
pride, even to the persecution of
many of their brethren. Now this
was a great evil, which did cause
the more humble part of the people
to suffer great persecutions, and to
wade through much affliction.

35 Nevertheless they did fast and
pray oft, and did wax stronger and
stronger in their humility, and
firmer and firmer in the faith of
Christ, unto the filling their souls
with joy and consolation, yea, even
to the purifying and the sanctifi-
cation of their hearts, which sanc-
tification cometh because of their
fyielding their hearts unto God.

36 And it came to pass that the
fifty and second year ended in peace
also, save it were the exceedingly
great pride which had gotten into
the hearts of the people; and it was
because of their exceedingly great
riches and their prosperity in the
land; and it did grow upon them
from day to day.

37 And it came to pass in the fifty
and third year of the reign of the
judges, Helaman died, and his el-
dest son Nephi began to reign in
his stead. And it came to pass that
he did fill the judgment-seat with
justice and equity; yea, he did keep
