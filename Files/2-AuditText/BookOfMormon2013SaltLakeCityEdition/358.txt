time in the land of Nephi; it is so
if they are not slain.

13 And now these are the cities of
which the Lamanites have obtained
possession by the shedding of the
blood of so many of our valiant men:

14 The land of Manti, or the city
of Manti, and the city of Zeezrom,
and the city of Cumeni, and the
city of Antiparah.

15 And these are the cities which
they possessed when I arrived at
the city of Judea; and I found Anti-
pus and his men toiling with their
might to fortify the city.

16 Yea, and they were depressed
in body as well as in spirit, for they
had fought valiantly by day and
toiled by night to maintain their
cities; and thus they had suffered
great afflictions of every kind.

17 And now they were determined
to conquer in this place or die; there-
fore you may well suppose that this
little force which 1 brought with
me, yea, those sons of mine, gave
them great hopes and much joy.

18 And now it came to pass that
when the Lamanites saw that Anti-
pus had received a greater strength
to his army, they were compelled
by the orders of Ammoron to not
come against the city of Judea, or
against us, to battle.

19 And thus were we favored of
the Lord; for had they come upon
us in this our weakness they might
have perhaps destroyed our little
army; but thus were we preserved.

20 They were commanded by
Ammoron to maintain those cities
which they had taken. And thus
ended the twenty and sixth year.
And in the commencement of the
twenty and seventh year we had
prepared our city and ourselves for
defence.

21 Now we were desirous that
the Lamanites should come upon
us; for we were not desirous to
make an attack upon them in their
strongholds.

22 And it came to pass that we kept

 

spies out round about, to watch the
movements of the Lamanites, that
they might not pass us by night
nor by day to make an attack upon
our other cities which were on the
northward.

23 For we knew in those cities
they were not sufficiently strong
to meet them; therefore we were
desirous, if they should pass by us,
to fall upon them in their rear, and
thus bring them up in the rear at
the same time they were met in the
front. We supposed that we could
overpower them; but behold, we
were disappointed in this our desire.

24 They durst not pass by us with
their whole army, neither durst
they with a part, lest they should
not be sufficiently strong and they
should fall.

25 Neither durst they march down
against the city of Zarahemla; nei-
ther durst they cross the head of
Sidon, over to the city of Nephihah.

26 And thus, with their forces,
they were determined to maintain
those cities which they had taken.

27 And now it came to pass in the
second month of this year, there was
brought unto us many provisions
from the fathers of those my two
thousand sons.

28 And also there were sent two
thousand men unto us from the
land of Zarahemla. And thus we
were prepared with ten thousand
men, and provisions for them,
and also for their wives and their
children.

29 And the Lamanites, thus seeing
our forces increase daily, and pro-
visions arrive for our support, they
began to be fearful, and began to
sally forth, if it were possible to put
an end to our receiving provisions
and strength.

30 Now when we saw that the
Lamanites began to grow uneasy
on this wise, we were desirous to
bring a stratagem into effect upon
them; therefore Antipus ordered
that I should march forth with my
