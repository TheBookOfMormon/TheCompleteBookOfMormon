shall drink; nor yet for your body,
what ye shall put on. Is not the life
more than meat, and the body than
raiment?

26 Behold the fowls of the air,
for they sow not, neither do they
reap nor gather into barns; yet your
heavenly Father feedeth them. Are
ye not much better than they?

27 Which of you by taking thought
can add one cubit unto his stature?

28 And why take ye thought for
raiment? Consider the lilies of the
field how they grow; they toil not,
neither do they spin;

29 And yet I say unto you, that
even Solomon, in all his glory, was
not arrayed like one of these.

30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the
grass of the field, which today is,
and tomorrow is cast into the oven,
even so will he clothe you, if ye are
not of little faith.

31 Therefore take no thought, say-
ing, What shall we eat? or, What
shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall
we be clothed?

32 For your heavenly Father know-
eth that ye have need of all these
things.

33 But seek ye first the kingdom
of God and his righteousness, and
all these things shall be added
unto you.

34 Take therefore no thought for
the morrow, for the morrow shall
take thought for the things of it-
self. Sufficient is the day unto the
evil thereof.

CHAPTER 14

Jesus commands: Judge not; ask of God;
beware of false prophets.He prom-
ises salvation to those who do the will

of the Father.Compare Matthew 7.
About A.D. 34.

AND now it came to pass that when

 

Jesus had spoken these words he
turned again to the multitude,
and did open his mouth unto them
again, saying: Verily, verily, I say
unto you, Judge not, that ye be not
judged.

27For with what judgment ye
judge, ye shall be judged; and with
what measure ye mete, it shall be
measured to you again.

3 And why beholdest thou the
mote that is in thy brother’s eye,
but considerest not the beam that
is in thine own eye?

4 Or how wilt thou say to thy
brother: Let me pull the mote out
of thine eye.and behold, a beam
is in thine own eye?

5 Thou hypocrite, first cast the
’beam out of thine own eye; and
then shalt thou see clearly to cast the
mote out of thy brother’s eye.

6 Give not that which is holy
unto the dogs, neither cast ye your
pearls before swine, lest they tram-
ple them under their feet, and turn
again and rend you.

7 Ask, and it shall be given unto
you; seek, and ye shall find; knock,
and it shall be opened unto you.

8 For every one that asketh, receiv-
eth; and he that seeketh, findeth;
and to him that knocketh, it shall
be opened.

9 Or what man is there of you,
who, if his son ask bread, will give
him a stone?

10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give
him a serpent?

11 If ye then, being evil, know how
to give good gifts unto your chil-
dren, how much more shall your
Father who is in heaven give good
things to them that ask him?

12 Therefore, all things whatsoever
ye would that men should do to
you, do ye even so to them, for this
is the law and the prophets.
