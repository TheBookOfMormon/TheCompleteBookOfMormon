people of Nephi shall become
extinct.

12 Yea, and this because they
shall dwindle in unbelief and fall
into the works of darkness, and
lasciviousness, and all manner of
iniquities; yea, I say unto you, that
because they shall sin against so
great light and knowledge, yea, I say
unto you, that from that day, even
the fourth generation shall not all
pass away before this great iniquity
shall come.

13 And when that great day
cometh, behold, the time very soon
cometh that those who are now, or
the seed of those who are now num-
bered among the people of Nephi,
shall no more be numbered among
the people of Nephi.

14 But whosoever remaineth, and
is not destroyed in that great and
dreadful day, shall be numbered
among the Lamanites, and shall
become like unto them, all, save
it be a few who shall be called the
disciples of the Lord; and them
shall the Lamanites pursue even
until they shall become extinct.
And now, because of iniquity, this
prophecy shall be fulfilled.

15 And now it came to pass that
after Alma had said these things to
Helaman, he blessed him, and also
his other sons; and he also blessed
the earth for the righteous’ sake.

16 And he said: Thus saith the Lord
God.Cursed shall be the land,
yea, this land, unto every nation,
kindred, tongue, and people, unto
destruction, which do wickedly,
when they are fully ripe; and as IL
have said so shall it be; for this is
the cursing and the blessing of God
upon the land, for the Lord cannot

 

look upon sin with the least degree
of allowance.

17 And now, when Alma had said
these words he blessed the church,
yea, all those who should stand fast
in the faith from that time hence-
forth.

18 And when Alma had done this
he departed out of the land of Zara-
hemla, as if to go into the land of
’Melek. And it came to pass that
he was never heard of more; as to
his death or burial we know not of.

19 Behold, this we know, that he
was a righteous man; and the say-
ing went abroad in the church that
he was taken up by the Spirit, or
’buried by the hand of the Lord,
even as Moses. But behold, the scrip-
tures saith the Lord took Moses unto
himself; and we suppose that he
has also received Alma in the spirit,
unto himself; therefore, for this
cause we know nothing concerning
his death and burial.

20 And now it came to pass in the
commencement of the nineteenth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi, that Helaman
went forth among the people to de-
clare the word unto them.

21 For behold, because of their
wars with the Lamanites and the
many little dissensions and distur-
bances which had been among the
people, it became expedient that the
word of God should be declared
among them, yea, and that a regu-
lation should be made throughout
the church.

22 Therefore, Helaman and his
brethren went forth to establish the
church again in all the land, yea, in
every city throughout all the land
which was possessed by the people
