CHAPTER 1

Ammaron instructs Mormon concerning
the sacred records.War commences be-
tween the Nephites and the Lamanites.
The Three Nephites are taken away.
Wickedness, unbelief, sorceries, and
witchcraft prevail. About A.D. 321-26.

ND now I, Mormon, make a
record of the things which I
have both seen and heard, and

call it the Book of Mormon.

2 And about the time that Am-
maron hid up the records unto the
Lord, he came unto me, (I being
about ten years of age, and I began
to be learned somewhat after the
manner of the learning of my peo-
ple) and Ammaron said unto me: I
perceive that thou art a sober child,
and art quick to observe;

3 Therefore, when ye are about
twenty and four years old I would
that ye should remember the things
that ye have observed concerning
this people; and when ye are of that
age go to the land Antum, unto a
hill which shall be called Shim;
and there have I deposited unto
the Lord all the sacred engravings
concerning this people.

4 And behold, ye shall take the
plates of Nephi unto yourself, and
the remainder shall ye leave in the
place where they are; and ye shall
engrave on the plates of Nephi all
the things that ye have observed
concerning this people.

5 And I, Mormon, being a descen-
dant of Nephi, (and my fatherâ€™s
name was Mormon) I remembered
the things which Ammaron com-
manded me.

6 And it came to pass that I, being
eleven years old, was carried by my

 

father into the land southward, even
to the land of Zarahemla.

7 The whole face of the land had
become covered with buildings, and
the people were as numerous almost,
as it were the sand of the sea.

8 And it came to pass in this year
there began to be a war between
the Nephites, who consisted of the
Nephites and the Jacobites and the
Josephites and the Zoramites; and
this war was between the Nephites,
and the Lamanites and the Lemuel-
ites and the Ishmaelites.

9 Now the Lamanites and the
Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites were
called Lamanites, and the two par-
ties were Nephites and Lamanites.

10 And it came to pass that the
war began to be among them in
the borders of Zarahemla, by the
waters of Sidon.

11 And it came to pass that the
Nephites had gathered together a
great number of men, even to ex-
ceed the number of thirty thousand.
And it came to pass that they did
have in this same year a number
of battles, in which the Nephites
did beat the Lamanites and did slay
many of them.

12 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites withdrew their design,
and there was peace settled in the
land; and peace did remain for the
space of about four years, that there
was no bloodshed.

13 But wickedness did prevail
upon the face of the whole land,
insomuch that the Lord did take
away his beloved disciples, and
the work of miracles and of healing
did cease because of the iniquity of
the people.

14 And there were no gifts from
