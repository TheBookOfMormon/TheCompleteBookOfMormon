iniquities shall smite them at the
last day.

34 Wo unto the liar, for he shall
be thrust down to hell.

35 Wo unto the murderer who
deliberately killeth, for he shall
die.

36 Wo unto them who commit
whoredoms, for they shall be thrust
down to hell.

37 Yea, wo unto those that wor-
ship idols, for the devil of all devils
delighteth in them.

38 And, in fine, wo unto all those
who die in their sins; for they shall

39 O, my beloved brethren, re-
