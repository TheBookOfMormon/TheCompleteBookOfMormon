wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord;
and behold he did visit me, and
did soften my heart that I did be-
lieve all the words which had been
spoken by my father; wherefore, L
did not rebel against him like unto
my brothers.

17 And I spake unto Sam, making
known unto him the things which
the Lord had manifested unto me
by his Holy Spirit. And it came to
pass that he believed in my words.

18 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel
would not hearken unto my words;
and being grieved because of the
hardness of their hearts I cried unto
the Lord for them.

19 And it came to pass that the
Lord spake unto me, saying: Blessed
art thou, Nephi, because of thy
faith, for thou hast sought me
diligently, with lowliness of heart.

20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep
my commandments, ye shall pros-
per, and shall be led to a land of
promise; yea, even a land which I
have prepared for you; yea, a land
which is choice above all other
lands.

21 And inasmuch as thy brethren
shall rebel against thee, they shall
be cut off from the presence of
the Lord.

22 And inasmuch as thou shalt
keep my commandments, thou
shalt be made a ruler and a teacher
over thy brethren.

23 For behold, in that day that
they shall rebel against me, I will
’curse them even with a sore curse,
and they shall have no power over

 

thy seed except they shall rebel
against me also.

24 And if it so be that they rebel
against me, they shall be a scourge
unto thy seed, to stir them up in
the ways of remembrance.

to give the plates up.Nephi exhorts
and encourages his brethren.Laban
steals their property and attempts to
slay them.Laman and Lemuel smite
Nephi and Sam and are reproved by
an angel. About 600-592 B.c.

AND it came to pass that I, Nephi,
returned from speaking with the
Lord, to the tent of my father.

2 And it came to pass that he spake
unto me, saying: Behold I have
dreamed a dream, in the which
the Lord hath commanded me that
thou and thy brethren shall return
to Jerusalem.

3 For behold, Laban hath the
record of the Jews and also a ge-
nealogy of my forefathers, and
they are engraven upon plates of
brass.

4 Wherefore, the Lord hath com-
manded me that thou and thy
brothers should go unto the house
of Laban, and seek the records, and
bring them down hither into the
wilderness.

5 And now, behold thy brothers
murmur, saying it is a hard thing
which I have required of them; but
behold I have not required it of
