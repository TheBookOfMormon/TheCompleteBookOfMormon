repentance all men whosoever
would hearken unto their words.

20 And thus they went forth, and
the people did humble themselves
because of their words, insomuch
that they were highly favored of
the Lord, and thus they were free
from wars and contentions among
themselves, yea, even for the space
of four years.

21 But, as I have said, in the latter
end of the nineteenth year, yea, not-
withstanding their peace amongst
themselves, they were compelled
reluctantly to contend with their
brethren, the Lamanites.

22 Yea, and in fine, their wars
never did cease for the space of
many years with the Lamanites,
notwithstanding their much re-
luctance.

23 Now, they were sorry to take
up arms against the Lamanites, be-
cause they did not delight in the
shedding of blood; yea, and this
was not all.they were sorry to
be the means of sending so many
of their brethren out of this world
into an eternal world, unprepared
to meet their God.

24 Nevertheless, they could not
suffer to lay down their lives, that
their wives and their children
should be massacred by the bar-
barous cruelty of those who were
once their brethren, yea, and had
4dissented from their church, and
had left them and had gone to de-
stroy them by joining the Lamanites.

25 Yea, they could not bear that
their brethren should rejoice over
the blood of the Nephites, so long
as there were any who should keep
the commandments of God, for the
promise of the Lord was, if they
should keep his commandments
they should prosper in the land.

 

CHAPTER 49

The invading Lamanites are unable
to take the fortified cities of Ammoni-
hah and Noah.Amalickiah curses
God and swears to drink the blood of
Moroni.Helaman and his brethren
continue to strengthen the Church.
About 72 B.c.

AND now it came to pass in the elev-
enth month of the nineteenth year,
on the tenth day of the month, the
armies of the Lamanites were seen
approaching towards the land of
-Ammonihah.

2 And behold, the city had been
rebuilt, and Moroni had stationed
an army by the borders of the city,
and they had cast up dirt round
about to shield them from the ar-
rows and the stones of the Laman-
ites; for behold, they fought with
stones and with arrows.

3 Behold, I said that the city of
Ammonihah had been rebuilt. Isay
unto you, yea, that it was in part
rebuilt; and because the Laman-
ites had destroyed it once because
of the iniquity of the people, they
supposed that it would again be-
come an easy prey for them.

4 But behold, how great was their
disappointment; for behold, the
Nephites had dug up a ridge of
earth round about them, which was
so high that the Lamanites could
not cast their stones and their ar-
rows at them that they might take
effect, neither could they come upon
them save it was by their place of
â€™entrance.

5 Now at this time the chief cap-
tains of the Lamanites were aston-
ished exceedingly, because of the
wisdom of the Nephites in prepar-
ing their places of security.

6 Now the leaders of the Lamanites
