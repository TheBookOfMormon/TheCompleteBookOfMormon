Zarahemila, and he was Anti-Christ,
for he began to preach unto the peo-
ple against the prophecies which
had been spoken by the prophets,
concerning the coming of Christ.

7 Now there was no law against a
man’s belief; for it was strictly con-
trary to the commands of God that
there should be a law which should
bring men on to unequal grounds.

8 For thus saith the scripture:
Choose ye this day, whom ye will
serve.

9 Now if a man desired to serve
God, it was his privilege; or rather,
if he believed in God it was his priv-
ilege to serve him; but if he did not
believe in him there was no law to
punish him.

10 But if he murdered he was
punished unto death; and if he
robbed he was also punished; and
if he stole he was also punished;
and if he committed adultery he
was also punished; yea, for all this
wickedness they were punished.

11 For there was a law that men
should be judged according to their
crimes. Nevertheless, there was no
law against a man’s belief; therefore,
a man was punished only for the
crimes which he had done; therefore
all men were on equal grounds.

12 And this Anti-Christ, whose
name was Korihor, (and the law
could have no hold upon him) be-
gan to preach unto the people that
there should be no Christ. And after
this manner did he preach, saying:

13 O ye that are bound down un-
der a foolish and a vain hope, why
do ye yoke yourselves with such
foolish things? Why do ye look for
a Christ? For no man can know of
anything which is to come.

14 Behold, these things which ye

 

call prophecies, which ye say are
handed down by holy prophets,
behold, they are foolish traditions
of your fathers.

15 How do ye know of their surety?
Behold, ye cannot know of things
which ye do not see; therefore ye
cannot know that there shall be a
Christ.

16 Ye look forward and say that
ye see a remission of your sins. But
behold, it is the effect of a frenzied
mind; and this derangement of your
minds comes because of the tradi-
tions of your fathers, which lead
you away into a belief of things
which are not so.

17 And many more such things
did he say unto them, telling them
that there could be no atonement
made for the sins of men, but every
man fared in this life according to
the management of the creature;
therefore every man prospered
according to his genius, and that
every man conquered according
to his strength; and whatsoever a
man did was no crime.

18 And thus he did preach unto
them, leading away the hearts of
many, causing them to lift up their
heads in their wickedness, yea, lead-
ing away many women, and also
men, to commit whoredoms.telling
them that when a man was dead,
that was the end thereof.

19 Now this man went over to the
land of Jershon also, to preach
these things among the people of
Ammon, who were once the people
of the Lamanites.

20 But behold they were more wise
than many of the Nephites; for they
took him, and bound him, and car-
ried him before Ammon, who was
a high priest over that people.
