sin and transgression, they become
more hardened, and thus their state
becomes worse than though they
had never known these things.

CHAPTER 25

Lamanite aggressions spread.The
seed of the priests of Noah perish as
Abinadi prophesied.Many Laman-
ites are converted and join the people
of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.They believe in
Christ and keep the law of Moses. About
90-77 B.c.

AND behold, now it came to pass
that those Lamanites were more
angry because they had slain their
brethren; therefore they swore
vengeance upon the Nephites; and
they did no more attempt to slay
the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi at
that time.

2 But they took their armies and
went over into the borders of the
land of Zarahemla, and fell upon
the people who were in the land of
Ammonihah and destroyed them.

3 And after that, they had many
battles with the Nephites, in the
which they were driven and slain.

4 And among the Lamanites who
were slain were almost all the seed
of Amulon and his brethren, who
were the priests of Noah, and they
were slain by the hands of the
Nephites;

5 And the remainder, having fled
into the east wilderness, and hav-
ing usurped the power and au-
thority over the Lamanites, caused
that many of the Lamanites should
â€™perish by fire because of their
belief.

6 For many of them, after having
suffered much loss and so many
afflictions, began to be stirred
up in remembrance of the words
which Aaron and his brethren had

 

preached to them in their land;
therefore they began to disbelieve
the traditions of their fathers, and
to believe in the Lord, and that he
gave great power unto the Nephites;
and thus there were many of them
converted in the wilderness.

7 And it came to pass that those
rulers who were the remnant of
the children of Amulon caused
that they should be put to death,
yea, all those that believed in these
things.

8 Now this martyrdom caused that
many of their brethren should be
stirred up to anger; and there began
to be contention in the wilderness;
and the Lamanites began to hunt
the seed of Amulon and his breth-
ren and began to slay them; and
they fled into the east wilderness.

9 And behold they are hunted at
this day by the Lamanites. Thus
the words of Abinadi were brought
to pass, which he said concerning
the seed of the priests who caused
that he should suffer death by fire.

10 For he said unto them: What ye
shall do unto me shall be a type
of things to come.

11 And now Abinadi was the first
that suffered death by fire because
of his belief in God; now this is
what he meant, that many should
suffer death by fire, according as
he had suffered.

12 And he said unto the priests of
Noah that their seed should cause
many to be put to death, in the
like manner as he was, and that
they should be scattered abroad
and slain, even as a sheep having
no shepherd is driven and slain by
wild beasts; and now behold, these
words were verified, for they were
driven by the Lamanites, and they
were hunted, and they were smitten.

13 And it came to pass that when
