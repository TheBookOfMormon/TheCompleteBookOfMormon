of men; for he will not suffer that the
wicked shall destroy the righteous.

17 Wherefore, he will preserve the
righteous by his power, even if it
so be that the fulness of his wrath
must come, and the righteous be
preserved, even unto the destruction
of their enemies by fire. Wherefore,
the righteous need not fear; for
thus saith the prophet, they shall
be saved, even if it so be as by fire.

18 Behold, my brethren, I say unto
you, that these things must shortly
come; yea, even blood, and fire, and
vapor of smoke must come; and it
must needs be upon the face of this
earth; and it cometh unto men ac-
cording to the flesh if it so be that
they will harden their hearts against
the Holy One of Israel.

19 For behold, the righteous shall
not perish; for the time surely must
come that all they who fight against
Zion shall be cut off.

20 And the Lord will surely pre-
pare a way for his people, unto the
fulfilling of the words of Moses,
which he spake, saying: A prophet
shall the Lord your God raise up
unto you, like unto me; him shall
ye hear in all things whatsoever
he shall say unto you. And it shall
come to pass that all those who will
not hear that prophet shall be cut
off from among the people.

21 And nowI, Nephi, declare unto
you, that this prophet of whom
Moses spake was the Holy One of
Israel; wherefore, he shall execute
judgment in righteousness.

22 And the righteous need not fear,

 

for they are those who shall not be
confounded. But it is the kingdom
of the devil, which shall be built up
among the children of men, which
kingdom is established among them
which are in the flesh.

23 For the time speedily shall come
that all churches which are built
up to get gain, and all those who
are built up to get power over the
flesh, and those who are built up
to become popular in the eyes of
the world, and those who seek the
lusts of the flesh and the things of
the world, and to do all manner of
iniquity; yea, in fine, all those who
belong to the kingdom of the devil
are they who need fear, and tremble,
and quake; they are those who must
be brought low in the dust; they
are those who must be consumed
as stubble; and this is according to
the words of the prophet.

24 And the time cometh speed-
ily that the righteous must be led
up as calves of the stall, and the
Holy One of Israel must reign in
dominion, and might, and power,
and great glory.

25 And he gathereth his children
from the four quarters of the earth;
and he numbereth his sheep, and
they know him; and there shall be
one fold and one shepherd; and he
shall feed his sheep, and in him
they shall find pasture.

26 And because of the righteous-
ness of his people, Satan has no
power; wherefore, he cannot be
loosed for the space of many years;
for he hath no power over the hearts
