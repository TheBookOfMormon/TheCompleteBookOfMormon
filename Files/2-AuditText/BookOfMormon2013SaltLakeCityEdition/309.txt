bondage and captivity from time
to time.

29 Yea, and he has also brought
our fathers out of the land of Jeru-
salem; and he has also, by his ever-
lasting power, delivered them out of
bondage and captivity, from time
to time even down to the present
day; and I have always retained in
remembrance their captivity; yea,
and ye also ought to retain in re-
membrance, as I have done, their
captivity.

30 But behold, my son, this is not
all; for ye ought to know as I do
know, that inasmuch as ye shall
keep the commandments of God ye
shall prosper in the land; and ye
ought to know also, that inasmuch
as ye will not keep the command-
ments of God ye shall be cut off from
his presence. Now this is according
to his word.

CHAPTER 37

The plates of brass and other scriptures
are preserved to bring souls to salva-
tion.The Jaredites were destroyed
because of their wickedness.Their
secret oaths and covenants must be
kept from the people.Counsel with
the Lord in all your doings.As the

3 And these plates of brass, which
contain these engravings, which
have the records of the holy scrip-
tures upon them, which have the
’genealogy of our forefathers, even
from the beginning.

4 Behold, it has been prophesied
by our fathers, that they should be
kept and handed down from one
generation to another, and be kept
and preserved by the hand of the
Lord until they should go forth unto
every nation, kindred, tongue, and
people, that they shall know of the
’mysteries contained thereon.

5 And now behold, if they are
kept they must retain their bright-
ness; yea, and they will retain their
brightness; yea, and also shall all
the plates which do contain that
which is holy writ.

6 Now ye may suppose that this is
foolishness in me; but behold I say
unto you, that by small and sim-
ple things are great things brought
to pass; and small means in many
instances doth confound the wise.

7 And the Lord God doth work

the salvation of many souls.

8 And now, it has hitherto been
wisdom in God that these things
