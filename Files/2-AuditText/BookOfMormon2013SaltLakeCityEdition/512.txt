7 And it came to pass that Akish
began to be jealous of his son,
therefore he shut him up in prison,
and kept him upon little or no food
until he had suffered death.

8 And now the brother of him that
suffered death, (and his name was
Nimrah) was angry with his father
because of that which his father
had done unto his brother.

9 And it came to pass that Nimrah
gathered together a small number of
men, and fled out of the land, and
came over and dwelt with Omer.

10 And it came to pass that Akish
begat other sons, and they won the
hearts of the people, notwithstand-
ing they had sworn unto him to do
all manner of iniquity according to
that which he desired.

11 Now the people of Akish were
desirous for gain, even as Akish was
desirous for power; wherefore, the
sons of Akish did offer them money,
by which means they drew away the
more part of the people after them.

12 And there began to be a war
between the sons of Akish and
Akish, which lasted for the space
of many years, yea, unto the de-
struction of nearly all the people
of the kingdom, yea, even all, save
it were thirty souls, and they who
fled with the house of Omer.

13 Wherefore, Omer was restored
again to the land of his inheritance.

14 And it came to pass that Omer
began to be old; nevertheless, in
his old age he begat Emer; and he
anointed Emer to be king to reign
in his stead.

15 And after that he had anointed
Emer to be king he saw peace in
the land for the space of two years,
and he died, having seen exceed-
ingly many days, which were full
of sorrow. And it came to pass that
Emer did reign in his stead, and did
fill the steps of his father.

 

16 And the Lord began again to
take the curse from off the land, and
the house of Emer did prosper ex-
ceedingly under the reign of Emer;
and in the space of sixty and two
years they had become exceedingly
strong, insomuch that they became
exceedingly rich.

17 Having all manner of fruit,
and of grain, and of silks, and of
fine linen, and of gold, and of sil-
ver, and of precious things;

18 And also all manner of cattle,
of oxen, and cows, and of sheep,
and of swine, and of goats, and also
many other kinds of animals which
were useful for the food of man.

19 And they also had horses, and
asses, and there were elephants
and cureloms and cumoms; all of
which were useful unto man, and
more especially the elephants and
cureloms and cumoms.

20 And thus the Lord did pour out
his blessings upon this land, which
was choice above all other lands;
and he commanded that whoso
should possess the land should
possess it unto the Lord, or they
should be destroyed when they
were ripened in iniquity; for upon
such, saith the Lord: I will pour out
the fulness of my wrath.

21 And Emer did execute judg-
ment in righteousness all his days,
and he begat many sons and daugh-
ters; and he begat Coriantum, and
he anointed Coriantum to reign in
his stead.

22 And after he had anointed
Coriantum to reign in his stead he
lived four years, and he saw peace
in the land; yea, and he even saw
the Son of Righteousness, and did
rejoice and glory in his day; and he
died in peace.

23 And it came to pass that Corian-
tum did walk in the steps of his
father, and did build many mighty
