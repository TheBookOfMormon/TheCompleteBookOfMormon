the work of the Lord, neither con-
sider the operation of his hands.

13 Therefore, my people are gone
into captivity, because they have
no knowledge; and their honorable
men are famished, and their mul-
titude dried up with thirst.

14 Therefore, hell hath enlarged her-
self, and opened her mouth without
measure; and their glory, and their
multitude, and their pomp, and he
that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.

15 And the mean man shall be
brought down, and the mighty
man shall be humbled, and the
eyes of the lofty shall be humbled.

16 But the Lord of Hosts shall be
exalted in judgment, and God that
is holy shall be sanctified in righ-
teousness.

17 Then shall the lambs feed after
their manner, and the waste places
of the fat ones shall strangers eat.

18 Wo unto them that draw iniq-
uity with cords of vanity, and sin
as it were with a cart rope;

19 That say: Let him make speed,
bhasten his work, that we may see
it; and let the counsel of the Holy
One of Israel draw nigh and come,
that we may know it.

20 Wo unto them that call evil
good, and good evil, that put dark-
ness for light, and light for dark-
ness, that put bitter for sweet, and
sweet for bitter!

21 Wo unto the wise in their own
eyes and prudent in their own sight!

22 Wo unto the mighty to drink
wine, and men of strength to min-
gle strong drink;

 

23 Who justify the wicked for re-
ward, and take away the righteous-
ness of the righteous from him!

24 Therefore, as the fire devoureth
the stubble, and the flame con-
sumeth the chaff, their root shall
be rottenness, and their blossoms
shall go up as dust; because they
have cast away the law of the Lord
of Hosts, and despised the word of
the Holy One of Israel.

25 Therefore, is the anger of the
Lord kindled against his people,
and he hath stretched forth his
hand against them, and hath smit-
ten them; and the hills did trem-
ble, and their carcasses were torn
in the midst of the streets. For all
this his anger is not turned away,
but his hand is stretched out still.

26 And he will lift up an ensign
to the nations from far, and will
hiss unto them from the end of the
earth; and behold, they shall 4come
with speed swiftly; none shall be
weary nor stumble among them.

27 None shall slumber nor sleep;
neither shall the girdle of their
loins be loosed, nor the latchet of
their shoes be broken;

28 Whose arrows shall be sharp,
and all their bows bent, and their
horsesâ€™ hoofs shall be counted like
flint, and their wheels like a whirl-
wind, their roaring like a lion.

29 They shall roar like young li-
ons; yea, they shall roar, and lay
hold of the prey, and shall carry
away safe, and none shall deliver.

30 And in that day they shall roar
against them like the roaring of the
