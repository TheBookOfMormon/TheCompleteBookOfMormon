perverse generation, why hath Sa-
tan got such great hold upon your
hearts? Why will ye yield yourselves
unto him that he may have power
over you, to blind your eyes, that
ye will not understand the words
which are spoken, according to
their truth?

26 For behold, have I testified
against your law? Ye do not un-
derstand; ye say that I have spoken
against your law; but I have not,
but I have spoken in favor of your
law, to your condemnation.

27 And now behold, I say unto you,
that the foundation of the destruc-
tion of this people is beginning to
be laid by the unrighteousness of
your lawyers and your judges.

28 And now it came to pass that
when Amulek had spoken these
words the people cried out against
him, saying: Now we know that this
man is a child of the devil, for he
hath lied unto us; for he hath spo-
ken against our law. And now he says
that he has not spoken against it.

29 And again, he has reviled
against our lawyers, and our judges.

30 And it came to pass that the
lawyers put it into their hearts that
they should remember these things
against him.

31 And there was one among them
whose name was Zeezrom. Now he
was the foremost to accuse Amu-
lek and Alma, he being one of the
most expert among them, having
much business to do among the
people.

32 Now the object of these lawyers
was to get gain; and they got gain
according to their employ.

CHAPTER 11

The Nephite monetary system is set
forth.Amulek contends with Zeez-

 

tom.Christ will not save people in their
sins.Only those who inherit the king-
dom of heaven are saved.All men will
rise in immortality.There is no death
after the Resurrection. About 82 B.C.

Now it was in the law of Mosiah that
every man who was a judge of the
law, or those who were appointed
to be judges, should receive wages
â€™according to the time which they
labored to judge those who were
brought before them to be judged.

2 Now if a man owed another, and
he would not pay that which he
did owe, he was complained of to
the judge; and the judge executed
authority, and sent forth officers
that the man should be brought
before him; and he judged the man
according to the law and the evi-
dences which were brought against
him, and thus the man was com-
pelled to pay that which he owed,
or be stripped, or be cast out from
among the people as a thief and
a robber.

3 And the judge received for his
wages according to his time.a se-
nine of gold for a day, or a senum
of silver, which is equal to a senine
of gold; and this is according to the
law which was given.

4 Now these are the names of the
different pieces of their gold, and
of their silver, according to their
value. And the names are given by
the Nephites, for they did not reckon
after the manner of the Jews who
were at Jerusalem; neither did they
measure after the manner of the
Jews; but they altered their reck-
oning and their measure, according
to the minds and the circumstances
of the people, in every generation,
until the reign of the judges, they
having been established by king
Mosiah.
