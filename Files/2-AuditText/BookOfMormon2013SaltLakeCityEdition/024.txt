beckoned unto them; and I also did
say unto them with a loud voice
that they should come unto me, and
partake of the fruit, which was de-
sirable above all other fruit.

16 And it came to pass that they
did come unto me and partake of
the fruit also.

17 And it came to pass that I was
desirous that Laman and Lemuel
should come and partake of the
fruit also; wherefore, I cast mine
eyes towards the head of the river,
that perhaps I might see them.

18 And it came to pass that I saw
them, but they would not come
unto me and partake of the fruit.

19 And I beheld a rod of iron, and
it extended along the bank of the
river, and led to the tree by which
I stood.

20 And [ also beheld a strait and
narrow path, which came along by
the rod of iron, even to the tree by
which I stood; and it also led by the
head of the fountain, unto a large
and spacious field, as if it had been
a world.

21 And I saw numberless con-
courses of people, many of whom
were pressing forward, that they
might obtain the path which led
unto the tree by which I stood.

22 And it came to pass that they
did come forth, and commence in
the path which led to the tree.

23 And it came to pass that there
arose a mist of darkness; yea, even
an exceedingly great mist of dark-
ness, insomuch that they who had
commenced in the path did lose their

 

way, that they wandered off and
were lost.

24 And it came to pass that I be-
held others pressing forward, and
they came forth and caught hold of
the end of the rod of iron; and they
did press forward through the mist
of darkness, clinging to the rod of
iron, even until they did come forth
and partake of the fruit of the tree.

25 And after they had partaken of
the fruit of the tree they did cast
their eyes about as if they were
ashamed.

26 And [also cast my eyes round
about, and beheld, on the other
side of the river of water, a great
and spacious building; and it stood
as it were in the air, high above
the earth.

27 And it was filled with people,
both old and young, both male and
female; and their manner of dress
was exceedingly fine; and they
were in the attitude of mocking
and pointing their fingers towards
those who had come at and were
partaking of the fruit.

28 And after they had tasted of
the fruit they were ashamed, be-
cause of those that were scoffing
at them; and they fell away into
forbidden paths and were lost.

29 And now I, Nephi, do not speak
all the words of my father.

30 But, to be short in writing,
behold, he saw other multitudes
pressing forward; and they came
and caught hold of the end of the
rod of iron; and they did press their
way forward, continually holding
