all righteousness; therefore, the Lord
has no place in him, for he dwelleth
not in unholy temples.

38 Therefore if that man re-
penteth not, and remaineth and di-
eth an enemy to God, the demands
of divine justice do awaken his
immortal soul to a lively sense of
his own guilt, which doth cause
him to shrink from the presence
of the Lord, and doth fill his breast
with guilt, and pain, and anguish,
which is like an unquenchable fire,
whose flame ascendeth up forever
and ever.

39 And now I say unto you, that
mercy hath no claim on that man;
therefore his final doom is to endure
a never-ending torment.

40 O, all ye old men, and also ye
young men, and you little children
who can understand my words, for
Ihave spoken plainly unto you that
ye might understand, I pray that ye
should awake to a remembrance
of the awful situation of those that
have fallen into transgression.

41 And moreover, I would desire
that ye should consider on the
blessed and happy state of those
that keep the commandments of
God. For behold, they are blessed
in all things, both temporal and
spiritual; and if they hold out faith-
ful to the end they are received
into heaven, that thereby they
may dwell with God in a state of
never-ending happiness. O remem-
ber, remember that these things
are true; for the Lord God hath
spoken it.

 

CHAPTER 3

King Benjamin continues his address.
The Lord Omnipotent will minister

is the only name whereby salvation
comes.Men can put off the natural
man and become Saints through the
Atonement.The torment of the wicked
will be as a lake of fire and brimstone.

AND again my brethren, I would call
your attention, for I have somewhat
more to speak unto you; for behold,
[have things to tell you concerning
that which is to come.

2 And the things which I shall tell
you are made known unto me by
an angel from God. And he said
unto me: Awake; and I awoke, and
behold he stood before me.

3 And he said unto me: Awake,
and hear the words which I shall
tell thee; for behold,  am come to
declare unto you the glad tidings
of great joy.

4 For the Lord hath heard thy
prayers, and hath judged of thy
righteousness, and hath sent me to
declare unto thee that thou may-
est rejoice; and that thou mayest
declare unto thy people, that they
may also be filled with joy.

5 For behold, the time cometh,
and is not far distant, that with
power, the Lord Omnipotent who
reigneth, who was, and is from
all eternity to all eternity, shall
come down from heaven among the
