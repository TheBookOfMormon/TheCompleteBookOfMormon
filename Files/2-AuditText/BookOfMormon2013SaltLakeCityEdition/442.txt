shalt perform unto the Lord thine
oaths;

34 But verily, verily, I say unto
you, swear not at all; neither by
heaven, for it is God’s throne;

35 Nor by the earth, for it is his
footstool;

36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy
head, because thou canst not make
one hair black or white;

37 But let your communication be
>Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever
cometh of more than these is evil.

38 And behold, it is written, an eye
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;

39 But I say unto you, that ye shall
not resist evil, but whosoever shall
smite thee on thy right cheek, turn
to him the other also;

40 And if any man will sue thee at
the law and take away thy coat, let
him have thy cloak also;

41 And whosoever shall compel
thee to go a mile, go with him twain.

42 -Give to him that asketh thee,
and from him that would borrow
of thee turn thou not away.

43 And behold it is written also,
that thou shalt love thy neighbor and
hate thine enemy;

44 But behold I say unto you, love
your enemies, bless them that curse
you, do good to them that hate you,
and pray for them who despitefully
use you and persecute you;

45 That ye may be the children of
your Father who is in heaven; for
he maketh his sun to rise on the
evil and on the good.

 

46 Therefore those things which
were of old time, which were un-
der the law, in me are all fulfilled.

47 Old things are done away, and
all things have become new.

48 Therefore I would that ye should
be perfect even as I, or your Father
who is in heaven is perfect.

CHAPTER 13

Jesus teaches the Nephites the Lord’s
Prayer.They are to lay up treasures in
heaven.The twelve disciples in their
ministry are commanded to take no
thought for temporal things.Compare
Matthew 6. About A.D. 34.

VERILY, verily, I say that 1 would
that ye should do alms unto the
poor; but take heed that ye do not
your alms before men to be seen of
them; otherwise ye have no reward
of your Father who is in heaven.

2 Therefore, when ye shall do your
alms do not sound a trumpet before
you, as will hypocrites do in the
synagogues and in the streets, that
they may have glory of men. Ver-
ily I say unto you, they have their
reward.

3 But when thou doest alms let
not thy left hand know what thy
right hand doeth;

4 That thine alms may be in se-
cret; and thy Father who seeth in
secret, himself shall reward thee
openly.

5 And when thou prayest thou
shalt not do as the hypocrites, for
