their father, and because of their
bafflictions in the wilderness; and
they did murmur against my father,
because he had brought them out of
the land of Jerusalem, saying: Our
father is dead; yea, and we have wan-
dered much in the wilderness, and
we have suffered much affliction,
hunger, thirst, and fatigue; and after
all these sufferings we must perish
in the wilderness with hunger.

36 And thus they did murmur
against my father, and also against
me; and they were desirous to re-
turn again to Jerusalem.

37 And Laman said unto Lemuel
and also unto the sons of Ishmael:
Behold, let us slay our father, and
also our brother Nephi, who has
taken it upon him to be our ruler
and our teacher, who are his elder
brethren.

38 Now, he says that the Lord has
talked with him, and also that an-
gels have ministered unto him. But
behold, we know that he lies unto
us; and he tells us these things, and
he worketh many things by his
cunning arts, that he may deceive
our eyes, thinking, perhaps, that he
may lead us away into some strange
wilderness; and after he has led
us away, he has thought to make
himself a king and a ruler over us,
that he may do with us according
to his will and pleasure. And after
this manner did my brother Laman
’stir up their hearts to anger.

39 And it came to pass that the Lord
was with us, yea, even the voice of
the Lord came and did speak many
words unto them, and did chas-
ten them exceedingly; and after
they were chastened by the voice of
the Lord they did turn away their
anger, and did repent of their sins,

 

insomuch that the Lord did bless
us again with food, that we did not
perish.

His brethren oppose him.He exhorts
them by recounting the history of
God’s dealings with Israel.Nephi is
filled with the power of God.His

AND it came to pass that we did
again take our journey in the wil-
derness; and we did travel nearly
eastward from that time forth. And
we did travel and wade through
much affliction in the wilderness;
and our women did bear children
in the wilderness.

2 And so great were the blessings
of the Lord upon us, that while we
did live upon raw meat in the wil-
derness, our women did give plenty
of suck for their children, and were
strong, yea, even like unto the men;
and they began to bear their jour-
neyings without murmurings.

3 And thus we see that the com-
mandments of God must be fulfilled.
And if it so be that the children
of men keep the commandments
of God he doth nourish them, and
strengthen them, and provide
means whereby they can accom-
plish the thing which he has com-
manded them; wherefore, he did
’provide means for us while we did
sojourn in the wilderness.

4 And we did sojourn for the space
of many years, yea, even eight years
in the wilderness.

5 And we did come to the land
which we called Bountiful, because
