wherefore he was not favored of
the Lord.

14 And his brother did rise up in
rebellion against him, by which he
did bring him into captivity; and
he did remain in captivity all his
days; and he begat sons and daugh-
ters in captivity, and in his old age
he begat Levi; and he died.

15 And it came to pass that Levi
did serve in captivity after the
death of his father, for the space
of forty and two years. And he did
make war against the king of the
land, by which he did obtain unto
himself the kingdom.

16 And after he had obtained
unto himself the kingdom he did
that which was right in the sight
of the Lord; and the people did
prosper in the land; and he did live
to a good old age, and begat sons
and daughters; and he also begat
Corom, whom he anointed king in
his stead.

17 And it came to pass that Corom
did that which was good in the sight
of the Lord all his days; and he be-
gat many sons and daughters; and
after he had seen many days he did
pass away, even like unto the rest
of the earth; and Kish reigned in
his stead.

18 And it came to pass that Kish
passed away also, and Lib reigned
in his stead.

19 And it came to pass that Lib
also did that which was good in the
sight of the Lord. And in the days
of Lib the poisonous serpents were
destroyed. Wherefore they did go
into the land southward, to hunt
food for the people of the land, for
the land was covered with animals
of the forest. And Lib also himself
became a great hunter.

20 And they built a great city by

 

the narrow neck of land, by the
place where the sea divides the land.

21 And they did preserve the land
southward for a wilderness, to get
game. And the whole face of the
land northward was covered with
inhabitants.

22 And they were exceedingly
industrious, and they did buy and
sell and traffic one with another,
that they might get gain.

23 And they did work in all man-
ner of ore, and they did make gold,
and silver, and iron, and brass,
and all manner of metals; and they
did dig it out of the earth; where-
fore, they did cast up mighty heaps
of earth to get ore, of gold, and of
silver, and of iron, and of copper.
And they did work all manner of
fine work.

24 And they did have silks, and
fine-twined linen; and they did
work all manner of cloth, that they
might clothe themselves from their
nakedness.

25 And they did make all man-
ner of tools to till the earth, both
to plow and to sow, to reap and to
hoe, and also to thrash.

26 And they did make all manner
of tools with which they did work
their beasts.

27 And they did make all manner
of weapons of war. And they did
work all manner of work of exceed-
ingly curious workmanship.

28 And never could be a people
more blessed than were they, and
more prospered by the hand of the
Lord. And they were in a land that
was choice above all lands, for the
Lord had spoken it.

29 And it came to pass that Lib
did live many years, and begat sons
and daughters; and he also begat
Hearthom.
