have a perfect knowledge of their
enjoyment, and their righteousness,
being clothed with purity, yea,
even with the robe of righteousness.

15 And it shall come to pass that
when all men shall have passed from
this first death unto life, insomuch
as they have become immortal, they
must appear before the judgment-
seat of the Holy One of Israel; and
then cometh the judgment, and
then must they be judged according
to the holy judgment of God.

16 And assuredly, as the Lord liveth,
for the Lord God hath spoken it, and
it is his eternal word, which cannot
bpass away, that they who are righ-
teous shall be righteous still, and
they who are filthy shall be filthy
still; wherefore, they who are filthy
are the devil and his angels; and
they shall go away into /everlasting
fire, prepared for them; and their
torment is as a lake of fire and
brimstone, whose flame ascendeth
up forever and ever and has no end.

17 O the greatness and the justice
of our God! For he executeth all his
words, and they have gone forth
out of his mouth, and his law must
be fulfilled.

18 But, behold, the righteous,
the saints of the Holy One of Is-
rael, they who have believed in the
Holy One of Israel, they who have

 

endured the crosses of the world,
and despised the shame of it, they
shall 4inherit the kingdom of God,
which was prepared for them from
the foundation of the world, and
their joy shall be full forever.

19 O the greatness of the mercy
of our God, the Holy One of Israel!
For he delivereth his saints from
that awful monster the devil, and
death, and hell, and that lake of
fire and brimstone, which is end-
less torment.

20 O how great the holiness of our
God! For he knoweth all things,
and there is not anything save he
knows it.

21 And he cometh into the world
that he may save all men if they
will hearken unto his voice; for be-
hold, he suffereth the pains of all
men, yea, the pains of every living
creature, both men, women, and
children, who belong to the fam-
ily of Adam.

22 And he suffereth this that the
resurrection might pass upon all
men, that all might stand before
him at the great and judgment day.

23 And he commandeth all men
that they must repent, and be
>â€™baptized in his name, having
perfect faith in the Holy One of
Israel, or they cannot be saved in the
kingdom of God.
