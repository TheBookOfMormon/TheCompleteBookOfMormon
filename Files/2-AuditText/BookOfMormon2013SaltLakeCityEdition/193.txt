he was about his own life; never-
theless, Gideon did spare his life.

9 And the king commanded the
people that they should flee be-
fore the Lamanites, and he himself
did go before them, and they did
flee into the wilderness, with their
women and their children.

10 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites did pursue them, and
did overtake them, and began to
slay them.

11 Now it came to pass that the
king commanded them that all the
men should leave their wives and
their children, and flee before the
Lamanites.

12 Now there were many that
would not leave them, but had
rather stay and perish with them.
And the rest left their wives and
their children and fled.

13 And it came to pass that those
who tarried with their wives and
their children caused that their fair
daughters should stand forth and
plead with the Lamanites that they
would not slay them.

14 And it came to pass that the La-
manites had compassion on them,
for they were charmed with the
beauty of their women.

15 Therefore the Lamanites did
spare their lives, and took them
captives and carried them back
to the land of Nephi, and granted
unto them that they might possess
the land, under the conditions that
they would deliver up king Noah
into the hands of the Lamanites, and
deliver up their property, even one
half of all they possessed, one half
of their gold, and their silver, and
all their precious things, and thus
they should pay tribute to the king
of the Lamanites from year to year.

16 And now there was one of the
sons of the king among those that
were taken captive, whose name
was Limhi.

 

17 And now Limhi was desirous
that his father should not be de-
stroyed; nevertheless, Limhi was
not ignorant of the iniquities of his
father, he himself being a just man.

18 And it came to pass that Gideon
sent men into the wilderness se-
cretly, to search for the king and
those that were with him. And it
came to pass that they met the peo-
ple in the wilderness, all save the
king and his priests.

19 Now they had sworn in their
hearts that they would return to the
land of Nephi, and if their wives
and their children were slain, and
also those that had tarried with
them, that they would seek revenge,
and also perish with them.

20 And the king commanded them
that they should not return; and
they were angry with the king, and
caused that he should suffer, even
unto death by fire.

21 And they were about to take
the priests also and put them to
death, and they fled before them.

22 And it came to pass that they
were about to return to the land
of Nephi, and they met the men
of Gideon. And the men of Gideon
told them of all that had happened
to their wives and their children;
and that the Lamanites had granted
unto them that they might possess
the land by paying a tribute to the
Lamanites of one half of all they
possessed.

23 And the people told the men
of Gideon that they had slain the
king, and his priests had fled from
them farther into the wilderness.

24 And it came to pass that after
they had ended the ceremony, that
they returned to the land of Nephi,
rejoicing, because their wives and
their children were not slain; and
they told Gideon what they had
done to the king.

25 And it came to pass that the
