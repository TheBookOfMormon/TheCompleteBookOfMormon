15 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye
must watch and pray always, lest
ye be tempted by the devil, and ye
be led away captive by him.

16 And as I have prayed among
you even so shall ye pray in my
church, among my people who
do repent and are baptized in my
name. Behold lam the light; I have
set an example for you.

17 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had spoken these words unto
his disciples, he turned again unto
the multitude and said unto them:

18 Behold, verily, verily, lsay unto
you, ye must watch and pray always
lest ye enter into temptation; for
Satan desireth to have you, that
he may sift you as wheat.

19 Therefore ye must always pray
unto the Father in my name;

20 And whatsoever ye shall ask
the Father in my name, which is
right, believing that ye shall receive,
behold it shall be given unto you.

21 Pray in your families unto the
Father, always in my name, that
your wives and your children may
be blessed.

22 And behold, ye shall meet to-
gether oft; and ye shall not forbid
any man from coming unto you
when ye shall meet together, but
suffer them that they may come
unto you and forbid them not;

23 But ye shall pray for them, and
shall not cast them out; and if it so
be that they come unto you oft ye
shall pray for them unto the Father,
in my name.

24 Therefore, hold up your light

 

that it may shine unto the world.
Behold I am the light which ye
shall hold up.that which ye have
seen me do. Behold ye see that I
have prayed unto the Father, and
ye all have witnessed.

25 And ye see that I have com-
manded that @none of you should go
away, but rather have commanded
that ye should come unto me, that
ye might feel and see; even so shall
ye do unto the world; and whoso-
ever breaketh this commandment
suffereth himself to be led into
temptation.

26 And now it came to pass that
when Jesus had spoken these words,
he turned his eyes again upon the
disciples whom he had chosen, and
said unto them:

27 Behold verily, verily, I say unto
you, I give unto you another com-
mandment, and then I must go
unto my Father that I may fulfil
other commandments which he
hath given me.

28 And now behold, this is the
commandment which I give unto
you, that ye shall not suffer any
one knowingly to partake of my
flesh and blood unworthily, when
ye shall minister it;

29 For whoso eateth and drinketh
my flesh and blood unworthily
eateth and drinketh damnation to
his soul; therefore if ye know that
aman is unworthy to eat and drink
of my flesh and blood ye shall for-
bid him.

30 Nevertheless, ye shall not cast
him out from among you, but ye
