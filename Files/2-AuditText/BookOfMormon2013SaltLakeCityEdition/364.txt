from falling into the hands of our
enemies, yea, to contend with an
enemy which was innumerable.

9 And now the cause of these our
embarrassments, or the cause why
they did not send more strength unto
us, we knew not; therefore we were
grieved and also filled with fear, lest
by any means the judgments of God
should come upon our land, to our
overthrow and utter destruction.

10 Therefore we did pour out our
souls in prayer to God, that he would
strengthen us and deliver us out of
the hands of our enemies, yea, and
also give us strength that we might
retain our cities, and our lands, and
our possessions, for the support of
our people.

11 Yea, and it came to pass that
the Lord our God did visit us with
assurances that he would deliver
us; yea, insomuch that he did speak
peace to our souls, and did grant
unto us great faith, and did cause
us that we should hope for our
deliverance in him.

12 And we did take courage with
our small force which we had re-
ceived, and were fixed with a deter-
mination to conquer our enemies,
and to maintain our lands, and our
possessions, and our wives, and
our children, and the cause of our
liberty.

13 And thus we did go forth with
all our might against the Laman-
ites, who were in the city of Manti;
and we did pitch our tents by the
wilderness side, which was near
to the city.

14 And it came to pass that on the
morrow, that when the Lamanites
saw that we were in the borders by
the wilderness which was near the
city, that they sent out their spies
round about us that they might dis-
cover the number and the strength
of our army.

15 And it came to pass that when
they saw that we were not strong,

 

according to our numbers, and
fearing that we should cut them
off from their support except they
should come out to battle against
us and kill us, and also supposing
that they could easily destroy us
with their numerous hosts, therefore
they began to make preparations to
come out against us to battle.

16 And when we saw that they
were making preparations to come
out against us, behold, I caused
that Gid, with a small number of
men, should secrete himself in the
wilderness, and also that Teomner
and a small number of men should
secrete themselves also in the
wilderness.

17 Now Gid and his men were on
the right and the others on the left;
and when they had thus secreted
themselves, behold, I remained,
with the remainder of my army, in
that same place where we had first
pitched our tents against the time
that the Lamanites should come
out to battle.

18 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites did come out with their
numerous army against us. And
when they had come and were about
to fall upon us with the sword, I
caused that my men, those who
were with me, should retreat into
the wilderness.

19 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites did follow after us with
great speed, for they were exceed-
ingly desirous to overtake us that
they might slay us; therefore they did
follow us into the wilderness; and we
did pass by in the midst of Gid and
Teomner, insomuch that they were
not discovered by the Lamanites.

20 And it came to pass that when
the Lamanites had passed by, or
when the army had passed by, Gid
and Teomner did rise up from their
secret places, and did cut off the
spies of the Lamanites that they
should not return to the city.
