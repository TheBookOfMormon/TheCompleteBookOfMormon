4strugglings for my brethren, the
Lamanites.

12 And it came to pass that after
I had prayed and labored with all
diligence, the Lord said unto me: L
will grant unto thee according to
thy desires, because of thy faith.

13 And now behold, this was the
desire which I desired of him.that
if it should so be, that my people,
the Nephites, should fall into trans-
gression, and by any means be de-
stroyed, and the Lamanites should
not be destroyed, that the Lord
God would preserve a record of
my people, the Nephites; even if it
so be by the power of his holy arm,
that it might be brought forth at
some future day unto the Laman-
ites, that, perhaps, they might be
brought unto salvation.

14 For at the present our strug-
glings were vain in restoring them
to the true faith. And they swore in
their wrath that, if it were possible,
they would destroy our records
and us, and also all the traditions
of our fathers.

15 Wherefore, I knowing that the
Lord God was able to preserve our
records, I cried unto him continu-
ally, for he had said unto me: What-
soever thing ye shall ask in faith,
believing that ye shall receive in the
name of Christ, ye shall receive it.

16 And I had faith, and I did cry
unto God that he would preserve
the records; and he covenanted
with me that he would bring them
forth unto the Lamanites in his own
due time.

 

17 And I, Enos, knew it would be
according to the covenant which
he had made; wherefore my soul
did rest.

18 And the Lord said unto me:
Thy fathers have also required of
me this thing; and it shall be done
unto them according to their faith;
for their faith was like unto thine.

19 And now it came to pass that I,
Enos, went about among the people
of Nephi, prophesying of things to
come, and testifying of the things
which I had heard and seen.

20 And I bear record that the
people of Nephi did seek diligently
to restore the Lamanites unto
the true faith in God. But our la-
bors were vain; their hatred was
fixed, and they were led by their
evil nature that they became wild,
and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty
people, full of idolatry and filthi-
ness; feeding upon beasts of prey;
dwelling in #tents, and wandering
about in the wilderness with a short
skin girdle about their loins and
their heads shaven; and their skill
was in the bow, and in the cimeter,
and the ax. And many of them did
eat nothing save it was raw meat;
and they were continually seeking
to destroy us.

21 And it came to pass that the
people of Nephi did till the land,
and raise all manner of grain, and
of fruit, and flocks of herds, and
flocks of all manner of cattle of ev-
ery kind, and goats, and wild goats,
and also many horses.
