CHAPTER 8

The Lamanites seek out and destroy
the Nephites.The Book of Mormon
will come forth by the power of God.
Woes pronounced upon those who
breathe out wrath and strife against the
work of the Lord.The Nephite record
will come forth in a day of wicked-
ness, degeneracy, and apostasy. About
A.D. 400-421.

BEHOLD I, Moroni, do finish the
brecord of my father, Mormon. Be-
hold, I have but few things to write,
which things I have been com-
manded by my father.

2 And now it came to pass that
after the great and tremendous
battle at Cumorah, behold, the
Nephites who had escaped into the
country southward were hunted by
the Lamanites, until they were all
destroyed.

3 And my father also was killed by
them, and I even remain alone to
write the sad tale of the destruction
of my people. But behold, they are
gone, and I fulfil the commandment
of my father. And whether they will
slay me, I know not.

4 Therefore I will write and hide
up the records in the earth; and
whither I go it mattereth not.

5 Behold, my father hath made
this record, and he hath written
the intent thereof. And behold, I
would write it also if I had room
upon the plates, but I have not;
and ore I have none, for lam alone.
My father hath been slain in battle,
and all my kinsfolk, and I have not

 

friends nor whither to go; and how
long the Lord will suffer that  may
live I know not.

6 Behold, four hundred years have
passed away since the coming of
our Lord and Savior.

7 And behold, the Lamanites have
hunted my people, the Nephites,
down from city to city and from
place to place, even until they are
no more; and great has been their
fall; yea, great and marvelous is
the destruction of my people, the
Nephites.

8 And behold, it is the hand of the
Lord which hath done it. And behold
also, the Lamanites are at war one
with another; and the whole face of
this land is one continual round of
murder and bloodshed; and no one
knoweth the end of the war.

9 And now, behold, I say no more
concerning them, for there are none
save it be the Lamanites and rob-
bers that do exist upon the face of
the land.

10 And there are none that do
know the true God save it be the
disciples of Jesus, who did tarry in
the land until the wickedness of the
people was so great that the Lord
would not suffer them to remain
with the people; and whether they
be upon the face of the land no man
knoweth.

11 But behold, my father and I
have seen them, and they have
ministered unto us.

12 And whoso receiveth this record,
and shall not condemn it because of
the imperfections which are in it, the
same shall know of greater things
than these. Behold,  am Moroni;
and were it possible,  would make
all things known unto you.
