soul should be lost than that thou
shouldst be the means of bringing
many souls down to destruction,
by thy lying and by thy flattering
words; therefore if thou shalt deny
again, behold God shall smite thee,
that thou shalt become dumb, that
thou shalt never open thy mouth
any more, that thou shalt not de-
ceive this people any more.

48 Now Korihor said unto him: Ido
not deny the existence of a God, but
Ido not believe that there is a God;
and I say also, that ye do not know
that there is a God; and except ye
show me a sign, I will not believe.

49 Now Alma said unto him: This
willl give unto thee for a sign, that
thou shalt be struck dumb, accord-
ing to my words; and I say, that in
the name of God, ye shall be struck
dumb, that ye shall no more have
utterance.

50 Now when Alma had said these
words, Korihor was struck dumb,
that he could not have utterance,
according to the words of Alma.

51 And now when the chief judge
saw this, he put forth his hand and
wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art thou
convinced of the power of God?
In whom did ye desire that Alma
should show forth his sign? Would
ye that he should afflict others, to
show unto thee a sign? Behold, he
has showed unto you a sign; and
now will ye dispute more?

52 And Korihor put forth his hand
and wrote, saying: I know that I
am dumb, for I cannot speak; and
I know that nothing save it were
the power of God could bring this
upon me; yea, and I always knew
that there was a God.

53 But behold, the devil hath
deceived me; for he appeared
unto me in the form of an angel,
and said unto me: Go and reclaim
this people, for they have all gone

 

astray after an unknown God. And
he said unto me: There is 4no God;
yea, and he taught me that which
I should say. And I have taught his
words; and I taught them because
they were pleasing unto the car-
nal mind; and I taught them, even
untill had much success, insomuch
that I verily believed that they were
true; and for this cause I withstood
the truth, even until I have brought
this great curse upon me.

54 Now when he had said this, he
besought that Alma should pray
unto God, that the curse might be
taken from him.

55 But Alma said unto him: If this
curse should be taken from thee thou
wouldst again lead away the hearts
of this people; therefore, it shall
be unto thee even as the Lord will.

56 And it came to pass that the
curse was not taken off of Kori-
hor; but he was cast out, and went
about from house to house begging
for his food.

57 Now the knowledge of what
had happened unto Korihor was
immediately published throughout
all the land; yea, the proclamation
was sent forth by the chief judge to
all the people in the land, declar-
ing unto those who had believed
in the words of Korihor that they
must speedily repent, lest the same
judgments would come unto them.

58 And it came to pass that they
were all convinced of the wicked-
ness of Korihor; therefore they were
all converted again unto the Lord;
and this put an end to the iniquity
after the manner of Korihor. And
Korihor did go about from house to
house, begging food for his support.

59 And it came to pass that as he
went forth among the people, yea,
among a people who had separated
themselves from the Nephites and
called themselves Zoramites, being
