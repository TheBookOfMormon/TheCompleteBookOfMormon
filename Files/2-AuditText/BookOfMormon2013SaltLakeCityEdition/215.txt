anything contrary to that which
is right; but it is common for the
lesser part of the people to desire
that which is not right; therefore
this shall ye observe and make it
your law.to do your business by
the voice of the people.

27 And if the time comes that
the voice of the people doth choose
iniquity, then is the time that the
judgments of God will come upon
you; yea, then is the time he will
visit you with great destruction even
as he has hitherto visited this land.

28 And now if ye have judges, and
they do not judge you according to
the law which has been given, ye
can cause that they may be judged
of a higher judge.

29 If your higher judges do not
judge righteous judgments, ye shall
cause that a small number of your
lower judges should be gathered
together, and they shall judge your
higher judges, according to the voice
of the people.

30 And Icommand you to do these
things in the fear of the Lord; and
Icommand you to do these things,
and that ye have no king; that if
these people commit sins and iniq-
uities they shall be answered upon
their own heads.

31 For behold I say unto you, the
sins of many people have been
caused by the iniquities of their
kings; therefore their iniquities
are answered upon the heads of
their kings.

32 And now  desire that this in-
equality should be no more in this
land, especially among this my peo-
ple; but I desire that this land be a
land of liberty, and every man may
enjoy his rights and privileges alike,
so long as the Lord sees fit that we
may live and inherit the land, yea,

 

even as long as any of our posterity
remains upon the face of the land.

33 And many more things did king
Mosiah write unto them, unfolding
unto them all the trials and trou-
bles of a righteous king, yea, all the
travails of soul for their people, and
also all the murmurings of the peo-
ple to their king; and he explained
it all unto them.

34 And he told them that these
things ought not to be; but that
the burden should come upon all
the people, that every man might
bear his part.

35 And he also unfolded unto them
all the disadvantages they labored
under, by having an unrighteous
king to rule over them;

36 Yea, all his iniquities and
abominations, and all the wars, and
contentions, and bloodshed, and the
stealing, and the plundering, and
the committing of whoredoms, and
all manner of iniquities which can-
not be enumerated.telling them
that these things ought not to be,
that they were expressly repugnant
to the commandments of God.

37 And now it came to pass, after
king Mosiah had sent these things
forth among the people they were
convinced of the truth of his words.

38 Therefore they relinquished
their desires for a king, and became
exceedingly anxious that every
man should have an equal chance
throughout all the land; yea, and
every man expressed a willingness
to answer for his own sins.

39 Therefore, it came to pass that
they assembled themselves together
in bodies throughout the land, to
cast in their voices concerning who
should be their judges, to judge
them according to the law which
had been given them; and they were
