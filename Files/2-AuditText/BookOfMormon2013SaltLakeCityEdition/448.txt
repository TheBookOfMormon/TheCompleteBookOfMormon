7 Behold, because of their belief
in me, saith the Father, and because
of the unbelief of you, O house of
Israel, in the latter day shall the
truth come unto the Gentiles, that
the fulness of these things shall be
made known unto them.

8 But wo, saith the Father, unto the
unbelieving of the Gentiles.for
notwithstanding they have come
forth upon the face of this land,
and have scattered my people who
are of the house of Israel; and my
people who are of the house of Is-
rael have been cast out from among
them, and have been trodden under
feet by them;

9 And because of the mercies of the
Father unto the Gentiles, and also
the judgments of the Father upon
my people who are of the house of
Israel, verily, verily, lsay unto you,
that after all this, and I have caused
my people who are of the house of
Israel to be smitten, and to be af-
flicted, and to be slain, and to be
cast out from among them, and to
become hated by them, and to be-
come a hiss and a byword among
them.

10 And thus commandeth the
Father that I should say unto you:
At that day when the Gentiles shall
sin against my gospel, and shall re-
ject the fulness of my gospel, and
shall be lifted up in the pride of
their hearts above all nations, and
above all the people of the whole
earth, and shall be filled with all
manner of lyings, and of deceits,
and of mischiefs, and all manner

 

of hypocrisy, and murders, and
4priestcrafts, and whoredoms, and
of secret abominations; and if they
shall do all those things, and shall
reject the fulness of my gospel,
behold, saith the Father, I will
bring the fulness of my gospel from
among them.

11 And then will I remember my
covenant which I have made unto
my people, O house of Israel, and
I will bring my gospel unto them.

12 And I will show unto thee, O
house of Israel, that the Gentiles
shall not have power over you; but
I will remember my covenant unto
you, O house of Israel, and ye shall
come unto the knowledge of the
fulness of my gospel.

13 But if the Gentiles will repent
and return unto me, saith the
Father, behold they shall be num-
bered among my people, O house
of Israel.

14 And I will not suffer my people,
who are of the house of Israel, to
go through among them, and tread
them down, saith the Father.

15 But if they will not turn unto
me, and hearken unto my voice, I
will suffer them, yea, I will suffer
my people, O house of Israel, that
they shall go through among them,
and shall tread them down, and
they shall be as salt that hath lost
its savor, which is thenceforth good
for nothing but to be cast out, and
to be trodden under foot of my
people, O house of Israel.

16 Verily, verily, I say unto you,
thus hath the Father commanded
