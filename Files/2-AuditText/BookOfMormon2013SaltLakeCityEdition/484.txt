Lamanites could have had no power
over them.

5 But, behold, the judgments of
God will overtake the wicked; and
it is by the wicked that the wicked
are punished; for it is the wicked
that stir up the hearts of the chil-
dren of men unto bloodshed.

6 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites did make preparations
to come against the city Teancum.

7 And it came to pass in the
three hundred and sixty and fourth
year the Lamanites did come
against the city Teancum, that they
might take possession of the city
Teancum also.

8 And it came to pass that they
were repulsed and driven back by
the Nephites. And when the Neph-
ites saw that they had driven the
Lamanites they did again boast
of their own strength; and they
went forth in their own might, and
took possession again of the city
Desolation.

9 And now all these things had
been done, and there had been
thousands slain on both sides, both
the Nephites and the Lamanites.

10 And it came to pass that the
three hundred and sixty and sixth
year had passed away, and the La-
manites came again upon the Neph-
ites to battle; and yet the Nephites
repented not of the evil they had
done, but persisted in their wick-
edness continually.

11 And it is impossible for the
tongue to describe, or for man to
write a perfect description of the
horrible scene of the blood and
carnage which was among the
people, both of the Nephites and
of the Lamanites; and every heart
was hardened, so that they de-
lighted in the shedding of blood
continually.

 

12 And there never had been so
great wickedness among all the
children of Lehi, nor even among
all the house of Israel, according
to the words of the Lord, as was
among this people.

13 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites did take possession of
the city Desolation, and this be-
cause their number did exceed the
number of the Nephites.

14 And they did also march for-
ward against the city Teancum, and
did drive the inhabitants forth out
of her, and did take many prisoners
both women and children, and did
offer them up as sacrifices unto
their idol gods.

15 And it came to pass that in
the three hundred and sixty and
seventh year, the Nephites being
angry because the Lamanites had
sacrificed their women and their
children, that they did go against
the Lamanites with exceedingly
great anger, insomuch that they
did beat again the Lamanites, and
drive them out of their lands.

16 And the Lamanites did not
come again against the Nephites
until the three hundred and sey-
enty and fifth year.

17 And in this year they did come
down against the Nephites with all
their powers; and they were not
numbered because of the greatness
of their number.

18 And from this time forth did
the Nephites gain no power over the
Lamanites, but began to be swept
off by them even as a dew before
the sun.

19 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites did come down against
the city Desolation; and there was
an exceedingly sore battle fought in
the land Desolation, in the which
they did beat the Nephites.
