rid my garments of your blood,
at this period of time when I am
about to go down to my grave, that
I might go down in peace, and my
immortal spirit may join the choirs
above in singing the praises of a
just God.

29 And moreover, I say unto you
that I have caused that ye should
assemble yourselves together, that
I might declare unto you that I
can no longer be your teacher, nor
your king;

30 For even at this time, my whole
frame doth tremble exceedingly
while attempting to speak unto
you; but the Lord God doth sup-
port me, and hath suffered me that
I should speak unto you, and hath
commanded me that I should de-
clare unto you this day, that my
son Mosiah is a king and a ruler
over you.

31 And now, my brethren, I would
that ye should do as ye have hitherto
done. As ye have kept my command-
ments, and also the commandments
of my father, and have prospered,
and have been kept from falling into
the hands of your enemies, even so
if ye shall keep the commandments
of my son, or the commandments of
God which shall be delivered unto
you by him, ye shall prosper in the
land, and your enemies shall have
no power over you.

32 But, O my people, beware lest
there shall arise contentions among
you, and ye list to obey the evil
spirit, which was spoken of by my
father Mosiah.

33 For behold, there is a wo pro-
nounced upon him who listeth to

 

obey that spirit; for if he listeth
to obey him, and remaineth and
dieth in his sins, the same drin-
keth damnation to his own soul;
for he receiveth for his wages an
4everlasting punishment, having
transgressed the law of God con-
trary to his own knowledge.

34 I say unto you, that there are not
any among you, except it be your
little children that have not been
taught concerning these things, but
what knoweth that ye are eternally
indebted to your heavenly Father,
to render to him all that you have
and are; and also have been taught
concerning the records which con-
tain the prophecies which have been.
spoken by the holy prophets, even
down to the time our father, Lehi,
left Jerusalem;

35 And also, all that has been
spoken by our fathers until now.
And behold, also, they spake that
which was commanded them of
the Lord; therefore, they are just
and true.

36 And now, I say unto you, my
brethren, that after ye have known
and have been taught all these
things, if ye should transgress and
go contrary to that which has been
spoken, that ye do withdraw your-
selves from the Spirit of the Lord,
that it may have no place in you to
guide you in wisdomâ€™s paths that
ye may be blessed, prospered, and
preserved.

37 [say unto you, that the man that
doeth this, the same cometh out in
open rebellion against God; there-
fore he listeth to obey the evil
spirit, and becometh an enemy to
