Amilicites came upon the hill Am-
nihu, which was east of the river
Sidon, which ran by the land of
Zarahemla, and there they began
to make war with the Nephites.

16 Now Alma, being the chief
judge and the governor of the peo-
ple of Nephi, therefore he went up
with his people, yea, with his cap-
tains, and chief captains, yea, at
the head of his armies, against the
Amilicites to battle.

17 And they began to slay the Am-
licites upon the hill east of Sidon.
And the Amilicites did contend with
the Nephites with great strength,
insomuch that many of the Neph-
ites did fall before the Amlicites.

18 Nevertheless the Lord did
strengthen the hand of the Nephites,
that they slew the Amlicites with
great slaughter, that they began to
flee before them.

19 And it came to pass that the
Nephites did pursue the Amlicites
all that day, and did slay them with
much slaughter, insomuch that there
were slain of the Amlicites twelve
thousand five hundred thirty and
two souls; and there were slain of
the Nephites six thousand five hun-
dred sixty and two souls.

20 And it came to pass that when
Alma could pursue the Amlicites
no longer he caused that his peo-
ple should pitch their tents in the
valley of Gideon, the valley being
called after that Gideon who was
slain by the hand of Nehor with
the sword; and in this valley the
Nephites did pitch their tents for
the night.

21 And Alma sent spies to follow
the remnant of the Amlicites, that
he might know of their plans and
their plots, whereby he might guard
himself against them, that he might
preserve his people from being
destroyed.

 

22 Now those whom he had sent
out to watch the camp of the Amli-
cites were called Zeram, and Amnor,
and Manti, and Limher; these were
they who went out with their men
to watch the camp of the Amlicites.

23 And it came to pass that on the
morrow they returned into the camp
of the Nephites in great haste, be-
ing greatly astonished, and struck
with much fear, saying:

24 Behold, we followed the camp
of the 'Amlicites, and to our great
astonishment, in the land of Mi-
non, above the land of Zarahemla,
in the course of the land of Nephi,
we saw a numerous host of the La-
manites; and behold, the Amlicites
have joined them;

25 And they are upon our brethren
in that land; and they are fleeing
before them with their flocks, and
their wives, and their children, to-
wards our city; and except we make
haste they obtain possession of our
city, and our fathers, and our wives,
and our children be slain.

26 And it came to pass that the
people of Nephi took their tents,
and departed out of the valley of
Gideon towards their city, which
was the city of Zarahemla.

27 And behold, as they were cross-
ing the river Sidon, the Lamanites
and the Amlicites, being as nu-
merous almost, as it were, as the
sands of the sea, came upon them
to destroy them.

28 Nevertheless, the Nephites be-
ing strengthened by the hand of
the Lord, having prayed mightily
to him that he would deliver them
out of the hands of their enemies,
therefore the Lord did hear their
cries, and did strengthen them, and
the Lamanites and the Amlicites
did fall before them.

29 And it came to pass that Alma
fought with Amlici with the sword,
