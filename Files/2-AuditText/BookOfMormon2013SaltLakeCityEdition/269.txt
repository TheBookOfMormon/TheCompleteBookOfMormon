thither, they met the father of
Lamoni, who was king over all
the land.

9 And behold, the father of La-
moni said unto him: Why did ye
not come to the feast on that great
day when I made a feast unto my
sons, and unto my people?

10 And he also said: Whither art
thou going with this Nephite, who
is one of the children of a liar?

11 And it came to pass that La-
moni rehearsed unto him whither
he was going, for he feared to offend
him.

12 And he also told him all the
cause of his tarrying in his own
kingdom, that he did not go unto
his father to the feast which he had
prepared.

13 And now when Lamoni had re-
hearsed unto him all these things,
behold, to his astonishment, his
father was angry with him, and said:
Lamoni, thou art going to deliver
these Nephites, who are sons of a
liar. Behold, he robbed our fathers;
and now his children are also come
amongst us that they may, by their
cunning and their lyings, deceive
us, that they again may rob us of
our property.

14 Now the father of Lamoni com-
manded him that he should slay
Ammon with the sword. And he
also commanded him that he should
not go to the land of Middoni, but
that he should return with him to
the land of Ishmael.

15 But Lamoni said unto him: I
will not slay Ammon, neither will
Ireturn to the land of Ishmael, but
I go to the land of Middoni that L
may release the brethren of Ammon,
for I know that they are just men
and holy prophets of the true God.

16 Now when his father had heard
these words, he was angry with
him, and he drew his sword that
he might smite him to the earth.

 

17 But Ammon stood forth and
said unto him: Behold, thou shalt
not slay thy son; nevertheless, it
were better that he should fall than
thee, for behold, he has repented
of his sins; but if thou shouldst fall
at this time, in thine anger, thy soul
could not be saved.

18 And again, it is expedient that
thou shouldst forbear; for if thou
shouldst slay thy son, he being an
innocent man, his blood would cry
from the ground to the Lord his
God, for vengeance to come upon
thee; and perhaps thou wouldst
lose thy soul.

19 Now when Ammon had said
these words unto him, he answered
him, saying: I know that if  should
slay my son, that I should shed in-
nocent blood; for it is thou that hast
sought to destroy him.

20 And he stretched forth his hand
to slay Ammon. But Ammon with-
stood his blows, and also smote his
arm that he could not use it.

21 Now when the king saw that
Ammon could slay him, he began
to plead with Ammon that he would
spare his life.

22 But Ammon raised his sword,
and said unto him: Behold, I will
smite thee except thou wilt grant
unto me that my brethren may be
cast out of prison.

23 Now the king, fearing he should
lose his life, said: If thou wilt spare
me I will grant unto thee whatso-
ever thou wilt ask, even to half of
the kingdom.

24 Now when Ammon saw that he
had wrought upon the old king ac-
cording to his desire, he said unto
him: If thou wilt grant that my
brethren may be cast out of prison,
and also that Lamoni may retain his
kingdom, and that ye be not dis-
pleased with him, but grant that he
may do according to his own desires
in whatsoever thing he thinketh,
