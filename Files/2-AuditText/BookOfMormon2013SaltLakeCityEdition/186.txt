15 And O how beautiful upon the
mountains were their feet!

16 And again, how beautiful upon
the mountains are the feet of those
that are still publishing peace!

17 And again, how beautiful upon
the mountains are the feet of those
who shall hereafter publish peace,
yea, from this time henceforth and
forever!

18 And behold, I say unto you,
this is not all. For O how beautiful
upon the mountains are the feet
of him that bringeth good tidings,
that is the founder of peace, yea,
even the Lord, who has redeemed
his people; yea, him who has granted
salvation unto his people;

19 For were it not for the redemp-
tion which he hath made for his
people, which was prepared from
the foundation of the world, I say
unto you, were it not for this, all
mankind must have perished.

20 But behold, the bands of
death shall be broken, and the
Son reigneth, and hath power over
the dead; therefore, he bringeth to
pass the resurrection of the dead.

21 And there cometh a resurrec-
tion, even a first resurrection; yea,
even a resurrection of those that
have been, and who are, and who
shall be, even until the resurrection.
of Christ.for so shall he be called.

22 And now, the resurrection of
all the prophets, and all those that
have believed in their words, or all
those that have kept the command-
ments of God, shall come forth in
the first resurrection; therefore, they
are the first resurrection.

23 They are raised to dwell with

 

God who has redeemed them; thus
they have eternal life through
Christ, who has broken the bands
of death.

24 And these are those who have
part in the first resurrection; and
these are they that have died before
Christ came, in their ignorance, not
having salvation declared unto
them. And thus the Lord bringeth
about the restoration of these; and
they have a part in the first resur-
rection, or have eternal life, being
redeemed by the Lord.

25 And little children also have
eternal life.

26 But behold, and fear, and
tremble before God, for ye ought
to tremble; for the Lord redeemeth
none such that rebel against him
and die in their sins; yea, even all
those that have perished in their
sins ever since the world began,
that have wilfully rebelled against
God, that have known the command-
ments of God, and would not keep
them; these are they that have no
part in the first resurrection.

27 Therefore ought ye not to trem-
ble? For salvation cometh to none
such; for the Lord hath redeemed
none such; yea, neither can the
Lord redeem such; for he cannot
deny himself; for he cannot deny
justice when it has its claim.

28 And now I say unto you that
the time shall come that the salva-
tion of the Lord shall be declared to
every nation, kindred, tongue, and
people.

29 Yea, Lord, thy watchmen
shall lift up their voice; with the
voice together shall they sing; for
