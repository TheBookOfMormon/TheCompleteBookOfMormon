people unto him, or their utter de-
struction; for I know that they must
perish except they repent and re-
turn unto him.

23 And if they perish it will be like
unto the Jaredites, because of the
wilfulness of their hearts, seeking
for blood and revenge.

24 And if it so be that they perish,
we know that many of our brethren
have deserted over unto the Laman-
ites, and many more will also desert
over unto them; wherefore, write
somewhat a few things, if thou art
spared and I shall perish and not
see thee; but I trust that I may see
thee soon; for I have sacred records
that I would deliver up unto thee.

25 My son, be faithful in Christ;
and may not the things which I have
written grieve thee, to weigh thee
down unto death; but may Christ
lift thee up, and may his suffer-
ings and death, and the showing
his body unto our fathers, and his
mercy and long-suffering, and the
hope of his glory and of eternal life,
rest in your mind forever.

26 And may the grace of God the
Father, whose throne is high in the
heavens, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
who sitteth on the right hand of
his power, until all things shall
become subject unto him, be, and
abide with you forever. Amen.

A testimony of the Book of Mormon

company faith.Moroniâ€™s words speak
from the dust.Come unto Christ, be

Now I, Moroni, write somewhat
as seemeth me good; and I write
unto my brethren, the Lamanites;
and I would that they should know
that more than four hundred and
twenty years have passed away since
the sign was given of the coming
of Christ.

2 And I 4seal up these records,
after I have spoken a few words by
way of exhortation unto you.

3 Behold, I would exhort you that
when ye shall read these things, if
it be wisdom in God that ye should
read them, that ye would remember
how merciful the Lord hath been
unto the children of men, from the
creation of Adam even down until
the time that ye shall receive these
things, and ponder it in your hearts.

4 And when ye shall receive these
things, I would exhort you that ye
would ask God, the Eternal Father,
in the name of Christ, if these things
are not true; and if ye shall ask
with a sincere heart, with real in-
tent, having faith in Christ, he will
fmanifest the truth of it unto you,
by the power of the Holy Ghost.

5 And by the power of the Holy
Ghost ye may know the truth of
all things.
