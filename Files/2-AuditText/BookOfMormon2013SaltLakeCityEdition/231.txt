and dominion. Yea, my beloved
brethren, I say unto you, that the
Spirit saith: Behold the glory of
the King of all the earth; and
also the King of heaven shall very
soon shine forth among all the chil-
dren of men.

51 And also the Spirit saith unto
me, yea, crieth unto me with a
mighty voice, saying: Go forth and
say unto this people.Repent, for
except ye repent ye can in nowise
inherit the kingdom of heaven.

52 And again I say unto you,
the Spirit saith: Behold, the ax is
laid at the root of the tree; there-
fore every tree that bringeth not
forth good fruit shall be hewn
down and cast into the fire, yea,
a fire which cannot be consumed,
even an unquenchable fire. Behold,
and remember, the Holy One hath
spoken it.

53 And now my beloved brethren,
I say unto you, can ye withstand
these sayings; yea, can ye lay aside
these things, and trample the Holy
One under your feet; yea, can ye be
puffed up in the pride of your hearts;
yea, will ye still persist in the wear-
ing of costly apparel and setting
your hearts upon the vain things
of the world, upon your riches?

54 Yea, will ye persist in supposing
that ye are better one than another;
yea, will ye persist in the persecu-
tion of your brethren, who humble
themselves and do walk after the
holy order of God, wherewith they
have been brought into this church,
having been sanctified by the Holy
Spirit, and they do bring forth works
which are meet for repentance.

 

55 Yea, and will you persist in
turning your backs upon the poor,
and the needy, and in withholding
your substance from them?

56 And finally, all ye that will per-
sist in your wickedness, I say unto
you that these are they who shall
be hewn down and cast into the
fire except they speedily repent.

57 And now I say unto you, all
you that are desirous to follow the
voice of the good shepherd, come
ye out from the wicked, and be
ye separate, and touch not their
unclean things; and behold, their
names shall be blotted out, that
the names of the wicked shall not
be numbered among the names
of the righteous, that the word of
God may be fulfilled, which saith:
The names of the wicked shall
not be mingled with the names of
my people;

58 For the names of the righteous
shall be written in the book of life,
and unto them will I grant an inheri-
tance at my right hand. And now,
my brethren, what have ye to say
against this? I say unto you, if ye
speak against it, it matters not, for
the word of God must be fulfilled.

59 For what shepherd is there
among you having many sheep
doth not watch over them, that the
wolves enter not and devour his
flock? And behold, if a wolf enter
his flock doth he not drive him
out? Yea, and at the last, if he can,
he will destroy him.

60 And now I say unto you that
the good shepherd doth call after
you; and if you will hearken unto
his voice he will bring you into his
