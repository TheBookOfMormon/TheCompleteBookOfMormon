AND now, it came to pass that there
were many who heard the words
of Samuel, the Lamanite, which he
spake upon the walls of the city.
And as many as believed on his word
went forth and sought for Nephi;
and when they had come forth and
found him they confessed unto him
their sins and denied not, desiring
that they might be baptized unto
the Lord.

2 But as many as there were who
did not believe in the words of Sam-
uel were angry with him; and they
cast stones at him upon the wall,
and also many shot arrows at him
as he stood upon the wall; but the
Spirit of the Lord was with him,
insomuch that they could not hit
him with their stones neither with
their arrows.

3 Now when they saw that they
could not hit him, there were many
more who did believe on his words,
insomuch that they went away unto
Nephi to be baptized.

4 For behold, Nephi was baptizing,
and prophesying, and preaching,
crying repentance unto the people,
showing signs and wonders, working
miracles among the people, that
they might know that the Christ
must shortly come.

5 Telling them of things which
must shortly come, that they might
know and remember at the time of
their coming that they had been
made known unto them beforehand,
to the intent that they might believe;
therefore as many as believed on the
words of Samuel went forth unto
him to be baptized, for they came
repenting and confessing their sins.

6 But the more part of them did
not believe in the words of Samuel;
therefore when they saw that they
could not hit him with their stones
and their arrows, they cried unto
their captains, saying: Take this
fellow and bind him, for behold

 

he hath a devil; and because of the
power of the devil which is in him
we cannot hit him with our stones
and our arrows; therefore take him
and bind him, and away with him.

7 And as they went forth to lay
their hands on him, behold, he did
cast himself down from the wall,
and did flee out of their lands, yea,
even unto his own country, and
began to preach and to prophesy
among his own people.

8 And behold, he was never heard
of more among the Nephites; and
thus were the affairs of the people.

9 And thus ended the eighty and
sixth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi.

10 And thus ended also the eighty
and seventh year of the reign of the
judges, the more part of the people
remaining in their pride and wick-
edness, and the lesser part walking
more circumspectly before God.

11 And these were the conditions
also, in the eighty and eighth year
of the reign of the judges.

12 And there was but little altera-
tion in the affairs of the people,
save it were the people began to be
more hardened in iniquity, and do
more and more of that which was
contrary to the commandments of
God, in the eighty and ninth year
of the reign of the judges.

13 But it came to pass in the nine-
tieth year of the reign of the judges,
there were great signs given unto
the people, and wonders; and the
words of the prophets began to
be fulfilled.

14 And angels did appear unto
men, wise men, and did declare
unto them glad tidings of great joy;
thus in this year the scriptures be-
gan to be fulfilled.

15 Nevertheless, the people began
to harden their hearts, all save it
were the most believing part of them,
both of the Nephites and also of the
