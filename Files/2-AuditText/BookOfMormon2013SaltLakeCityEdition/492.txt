beasts nor poisonous serpents, be-
cause of the power of his word.

25 And behold, their prayers
were also in behalf of him that the
Lord should suffer to bring these
things forth.

26 And no one need say they shall
not come, for they surely shall, for
the Lord hath spoken it; for <out of
the earth shall they come, by the
hand of the Lord, and none can stay
it; and it shall come in a day when it
shall be said that miracles are done
away; and it shall come even as if
one should speak from the dead.

27 And it shall come ina day when
the blood of saints shall cry unto
the Lord, because of secret combi-
nations and the works of darkness.

28 Yea, it shall come in aday when
the power of God shall be denied,
and churches become defiled and
be lifted up in the pride of their
hearts; yea, even in a day when lead-
ers of churches and teachers shall
rise in the pride of their hearts,
even to the envying of them who
belong to their churches.

29 Yea, it shall come in aday when
there shall be heard of fires, and
tempests, and vapors of smoke in
foreign lands;

30 And there shall also be heard
of wars, rumors of wars, and earth-
quakes in divers places.

31 Yea, it shall come in aday when
there shall be great pollutions upon
the face of the earth; there shall be
â€™murders, and robbing, and lying,

 

and deceivings, and whoredoms, and

for they are in the gall of bitter-
ness and in the bonds of iniquity.

32 Yea, it shall come ina day when
there shall be churches built up
that shall say: Come unto me, and
for your money you shall be for-
given of your sins.

33 O ye wicked and perverse and
astiffnecked people, why have ye
built up churches unto yourselves
to get 'gain? Why have ye trans-
figured the holy word of God, that
ye might bring damnation upon
your souls? Behold, look ye unto
the revelations of God; for behold,
the time cometh at that day when
all these things must be fulfilled.

34 Behold, the Lord hath shown
unto me great and marvelous things
concerning that which must shortly
come, at that day when these things
shall come forth among you.

35 Behold, I speak unto you as if
ye were present, and yet ye are not.
But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown
you unto me, and I know your
doing.

36 And I know that ye do walk in
the pride of your hearts; and there
are none save a few only who do
not lift themselves up in the pride
of their hearts, unto the wearing of
very fine apparel, unto envying,
