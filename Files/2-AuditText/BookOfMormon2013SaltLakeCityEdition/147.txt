many prophets among us. And the
people were a stiffnecked people,
hard to understand.

23 And there was nothing save it
was exceeding harshness, preach-
ing and prophesying of wars, and
contentions, and destructions, and
continually reminding them of
death, and the duration of eternity,
and the judgments and the power of
God, and all these things.stirring
them up continually to keep them
in the fear of the Lord. I say there
was nothing short of these things,
and exceedingly great plainness of
speech, would keep them from go-
ing down speedily to destruction.
And after this manner do I write
concerning them.

24 And I saw wars between the
Nephites and Lamanites in the
course of my days.

25 And it came to pass that I be-
gan to be old, and an hundred and

seventy and nine years had passed
away from the time that our father
Lehi left Jerusalem.

26 And I saw that I must soon
go down to my grave, having been
wrought upon by the power of God
that I must preach and prophesy
unto this people, and declare the
word according to the truth which
is in Christ. And I have declared it
in all my days, and have rejoiced
in it above that of the world.

27 And Isoon go to the place of my
rest, which is with my Redeemer;
for I know that in him I shall rest.
And I rejoice in the day when my
mortal shall put on immortality,
and shall stand before him; then
shall I see his face with pleasure,
and he will say unto me: Come unto
me, ye blessed, there is a place pre-
pared for you in the mansions of
my Father. Amen.

THE BOOK OF JAROM

The Nephites keep the law of Moses,
look forward to the coming of Christ,
and prosper in the land.Many proph-
ets labor to keep the people in the way
of truth. About 399-361 B.c.

OW behold, I, Jarom, write
a few words according to
the commandment of my
father, Enos, that our genealogy

may be kept.
2 And as these plates are small,

and as these things are written
for the intent of the benefit of our
brethren the Lamanites, wherefore,
it must needs be that I write a little;
but I shall not write the things of
my prophesying, nor of my revela-
tions. For what could I write more
than my fathers have written? For
have not they revealed the plan of
salvation? I say unto you, Yea; and
this sufficeth me.
