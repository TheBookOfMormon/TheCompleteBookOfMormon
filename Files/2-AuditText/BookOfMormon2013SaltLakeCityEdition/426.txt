gone hence, who were the holy ones,
should be fulfilled according to their
faith, should make a record of these
things which have been done.

15 Yea, asmall record of that which
hath taken place from the time that
Lehi left Jerusalem, even down un-
til the present time.

16 Therefore I do make my record
from the accounts which have been
given by those who were before me,
until the commencement of my day;

17 And then I do make a record of
the things which I have seen with
mine own eyes.

18 And I know the record which I
make to be a just and a true record;
nevertheless there are many things
which, according to our language,
we are not able to write.

19 And now I make an end of my
saying, which is of myself, and
proceed to give my account of the
things which have been before me.

20 1 am Mormon, and a pure de-
scendant of Lehi. I have reason to
bless my God and my Savior Jesus
Christ, that he brought our fathers
out of the land of Jerusalem, (and
â€™no one knew it save it were him-
self and those whom he brought
out of that land) and that he hath
given me and my people so much
knowledge unto the salvation of
our souls.

21 Surely he hath blessed the
house of Jacob, and hath been
merciful unto the seed of Joseph.

22 And insomuch as the children
of Lehi have kept his command-
ments he hath blessed them and
prospered them according to his
word.

 

23 Yea, and surely shall he again
bring a remnant of the seed of Jo-
seph to the knowledge of the Lord
their God.

24 And as surely as the Lord lLiv-
eth, will he gather in from the four
quarters of the earth all the rem-
nant of the seed of Jacob, who are
scattered abroad upon all the face
of the earth.

25 Andas he hath covenanted with
all the house of Jacob, even so shall
the covenant wherewith he hath
covenanted with the house of Jacob
be fulfilled in his own due time,
unto the restoring all the house
of Jacob unto the knowledge of the
covenant that he hath covenanted
with them.

26 And then shall they know their
Redeemer, who is Jesus Christ, the
Son of God; and then shall they be
gathered in from the four quarters
of the earth unto their own lands,
from whence they have been dis-
persed; yea, as the Lord liveth so
shall it be. Amen.

CHAPTER 6

The Nephites prosper.Pride, wealth,
and class distinctions arise.The
Church is rent with dissensions.Sa-
tan leads the people in open rebellion.
Many prophets cry repentance and are
slain.Their murderers conspire to take
over the government. About A.D. 26-30.

AND now it came to pass that the
people of the Nephites did all return
to their own lands in the twenty
and sixth year, every man, with
his family, his flocks and his herds,
his horses and his cattle, and all
