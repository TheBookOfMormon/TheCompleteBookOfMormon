gathered into the garners, that they
are not wasted.

6 Yea, they shall not be beaten
down by the storm at the last day;
yea, neither shall they be harrowed
up by the whirlwinds; but when the
storm cometh they shall be gath-
ered together in their place, that
the storm cannot penetrate to them;
yea, neither shall they be driven
with fierce winds whithersoever
the enemy listeth to carry them.

7 But behold, they are in the hands
of the Lord of the harvest, and they
are his; and he will raise them up
at the last day.

8 Blessed be the name of our God;
let us sing to his praise, yea, let us
give thanks to his holy name, for
he doth work righteousness forever.

9 For if we had not come up out
of the land of Zarahemla, these
our dearly beloved brethren, who
have so dearly beloved us, would
still have been racked with hatred
against us, yea, and they would also
have been strangers to God.

10 And it came to pass that when.
Ammon had said these words, his
brother Aaron rebuked him, saying:
Ammon, I fear that thy joy doth
carry thee away unto boasting.

11 But Ammon said unto him: I
do not boast in my own strength,
nor in my own wisdom; but behold,
my joy is full, yea, my heart is
brim with joy, and I will rejoice in
my God.

12 Yea, I know that I am noth-
ing; as to my strength  am weak;
therefore I will not boast of myself,
but I will boast of my God, for in

 

his strength I can do all things;
yea, behold, many mighty mira-
cles we have wrought in this land,
for which we will praise his name
forever.

13 Behold, how many thousands of
our brethren has he loosed from the
pains of hell; and they are brought
to sing redeeming love, and this
because of the power of his word
which is in us, therefore have we
not great reason to rejoice?

14 Yea, we have reason to praise
him forever, for he is the Most High
God, and has loosed our brethren
from the chains of hell.

15 Yea, they were encircled about
with everlasting darkness and
destruction; but behold, he has
brought them into his everlasting
light, yea, into everlasting salvation;
and they are encircled about with
the matchless bounty of his love;
yea, and we have been instruments
in his hands of doing this great
and marvelous work.

16 Therefore, let us glory, yea,
we will glory in the Lord; yea, we
will rejoice, for our joy is full; yea,
we will praise our God forever. Be-
hold, who can glory too much in the
Lord? Yea, who can say too much of
his great power, and of his mercy,
and of his long-suffering towards
the children of men? Behold, I say
unto you, I cannot say the smallest
part which I feel.

17 Who could have supposed that
our God would have been so merci-
ful as to have snatched us from our
awful, sinful, and polluted state?

18 Behold, we went forth even in
