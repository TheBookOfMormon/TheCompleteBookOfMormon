AND again, I, Alma, having been
commanded of God that I should
take Amulek and go forth and
preach again unto this people, or
the people who were in the city of
Ammonihah, it came to pass as I
began to preach unto them, they
began to contend with me, saying:

2 Who art thou? Suppose ye that we
shall believe the testimony of one
man, although he should preach
unto us that the earth should pass
away?

3 Now they understood not the
words which they spake; for they
knew not that the earth should
pass away.

4 And they said also: We will not
believe thy words if thou shouldst
prophesy that this great city should
be destroyed in one day.

5 Now they knew not that God
could do such marvelous works,
for they were a hard-hearted and
a stiffnecked people.

6 And they said: Who is God, that
sendeth no more authority than one
man among this people, to declare
unto them the truth of such great
and marvelous things?

7 And they stood forth to lay their
hands on me; but behold, they did
not. And I stood with boldness to
declare unto them, yea, I did boldly
testify unto them, saying:

8 Behold, O ye wicked and perverse
generation, how have ye forgotten
the tradition of your fathers; yea,
how soon ye have forgotten the
commandments of God.

9 Do ye not remember that our
father, Lehi, was brought out of Je-
rusalem by the hand of God? Do
ye not remember that they were all
led by him through the wilderness?

10 And have ye forgotten so soon

 

how many times he delivered our
fathers out of the hands of their
enemies, and preserved them from
being destroyed, even by the hands
of their own brethren?

11 Yea, and if it had not been for
his matchless power, and his mercy,
and his long-suffering towards us,
we should unavoidably have been
cut off from the face of the earth
long before this period of time, and
perhaps been consigned to a state
of endless misery and woe.

12 Behold, now I say unto you that
he commandeth you to repent; and
except ye repent, ye can in nowise
inherit the kingdom of God. But
behold, this is not all.he has com-
manded you to repent, or he will
utterly destroy you from off the
face of the earth; yea, he will visit
you in his anger, and in his fierce
anger he will not turn away.

13 Behold, do ye not remember the
words which he spake unto Lehi, say-
ing that: 4Inasmuch as ye shall keep
my commandments, ye shall pros-
per in the land? And again it is said
that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep
my commandments ye shall be cut
off from the presence of the Lord.

14 Now I would that ye should
remember, that inasmuch as the
Lamanites have not kept the com-
mandments of God, they have been.
cut off from the presence of the
Lord. Now we see that the word of
the Lord has been verified in this
thing, and the Lamanites have been
cut off from his presence, from the
beginning of their transgressions
in the land.

15 Nevertheless I say unto you,
that it shall be more tolerable for
them in the day of judgment than
for you, if ye remain in your sins,
