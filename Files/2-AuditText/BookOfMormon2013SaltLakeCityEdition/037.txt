against the Lamb of God, they shall
be numbered among the seed of thy
father; yea, they shall be numbered
among the house of Israel; and they
shall be a blessed people upon the
promised land forever; they shall
be no more brought down into cap-
tivity; and the house of Israel shall
no more be confounded.

3 And that great pit, which hath
been digged for them by that great
and abominable church, which
was founded by the devil and his
children, that he might lead away
the souls of men down to hell.
yea, that great pit which hath been
digged for the destruction of men
shall be filled by those who digged
it, unto their utter destruction,
saith the Lamb of God; not the de-
struction of the soul, save it be the
casting of it into that hell which
hath no end.

4 For behold, this is according to
the captivity of the devil, and also
according to the justice of God, upon.

8 And it came to pass that when
the angel had spoken these words,
he said unto me: Rememberest thou
the covenants of the Father unto the
