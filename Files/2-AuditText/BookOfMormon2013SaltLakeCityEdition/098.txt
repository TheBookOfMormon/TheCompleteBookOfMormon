that peep and mutter.should not
a people seek unto their God for
the living to hear from the dead?

20 To the law and to the testi-
mony; and if they speak not ac-
cording to this word, it is because
there is no light in them.

21 And they shall pass through it
hardly bestead and hungry; and it
shall come to pass that when they
shall be hungry, they shall fret
themselves, and curse their king
and their God, and look upward.

22 And they shall look unto the
earth and behold trouble, and dark-
ness, dimness of anguish, and shall
be driven to darkness.

CHAPTER 19

Isaiah speaks messianically.The peo-
ple in darkness will see a great light.
Unto us a child is born.He will be
the Prince of Peace and will reign on
Davidâ€™s throne.Compare Isaiah 9.
About 559-545 B.C.

NEVERTHELESS, the dimness shall
not be such as was in her vexation,
when at first he lightly afflicted the
land of Zebulun, and the land of
4Naphtali, and afterwards did more
grievously afflict by the way of the
Red Sea beyond Jordan in Galilee
of the nations.

2 The people that walked in dark-
ness have seen a great light; they
that dwell in the land of the shadow
of death, upon them hath the light
shined.

3 Thou hast multiplied the nation,
and increased the joy.they joy
before thee according to the joy in
harvest, and as men rejoice when
they divide the spoil.

 

4 For thou hast broken the yoke
of his burden, and the staff of his
shoulder, the rod of his oppressor.

5 For every battle of the warrior is
with confused noise, and garments
rolled in blood; but this shall be
with burning and fuel of fire.

6 For unto us a child is born, unto
us a son is given; and the govern-
ment shall be upon his shoulder;
and his name shall be called, Won-
derful, Counselor, The Mighty God,
The Everlasting Father, The Prince
of Peace.

7 Of the increase of government
and peace there is no end, upon
the throne of David, and upon his
kingdom to order it, and to estab-
lish it with judgment and with jus-
tice from henceforth, even forever.
The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will
perform this.

8 The Lord sent his word unto Ja-
cob and it hath lighted upon Israel.

9 And all the people shall know,
even Ephraim and the inhabitants
of Samaria, that say in the pride
and stoutness of heart:

10 The bricks are fallen down, but
we will build with hewn stones;
the sycamores are cut down, but
we will change them into cedars.

11 Therefore the Lord shall set up
the adversaries of Rezin against
him, and join his enemies together;

12 The Syrians before and the Phi-
listines behind; and they shall de-
vour Israel with open mouth. For all
this his anger is not turned away,
but his hand is stretched out still.

13 For the people turneth not unto
him that smiteth them, neither do
they seek the Lord of Hosts.

14 Therefore will the Lord cut off
