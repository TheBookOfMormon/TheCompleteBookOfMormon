according to his desires, and marched
forth into the wilderness, and
headed the armies of Amalickiah.

33 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah fled with a small number of
his men, and the remainder were
delivered up into the hands of Mo-
roni and were taken back into the
land of Zarahemla.

34 Now, Moroni being a man who
was appointed by the chief judges
and the voice of the people, there-
fore he had power according to his
will with the armies of the Neph-
ites, to establish and to exercise
authority over them.

35 And it came to pass that whom-
soever of the Amalickiahites that
would not enter into a covenant to
support the cause of freedom, that
they might maintain a free govern-
ment, he caused to be put to death;
and there were but few who denied
the covenant of freedom.

36 And it came to pass also, that
he caused the title of liberty to be
hoisted upon every tower which was
in all the land, which was possessed
by the Nephites; and thus Moroni
planted the standard of liberty
among the Nephites.

37 And they began to have peace
again in the land; and thus they did
maintain peace in the land until
nearly the end of the nineteenth
year of the reign of the judges.

38 And Helaman and the high
priests did also maintain order in
the church; yea, even for the space
of four years did they have much
peace and rejoicing in the church.

39 And it came to pass that there
were many who died, firmly believ-
ing that their souls were redeemed
by the Lord Jesus Christ; thus they
went out of the world rejoicing.

40 And there were some who died

 

with fevers, which at some seasons
of the year were very frequent in
the land.but not so much so with
fevers, because of the excellent
qualities of the many plants and
roots which God had prepared to re-
move the cause of diseases, to which
men were subject by the nature of
the climate.

41 But there were many who died
with old age; and those who died
in the faith of Christ are happy in
him, as we must needs suppose.

CHAPTER 47

Amalickiah uses treachery, murder,
and intrigue to become king of the La-
manites.The Nephite dissenters are
more wicked and ferocious than the
Lamanites. About 72 B.c.

Now we will return in our record
to Amalickiah and those who had
fled with him into the wilderness;
for, behold, he had taken those who
went with him, and went up in the
land of Nephi among the Laman-
ites, and did stir up the Lamanites
to anger against the people of
Nephi, insomuch that the king of
the Lamanites sent a proclamation
throughout all his land, among all
his people, that they should gather
themselves together again to go to
battle against the Nephites.

2 And it came to pass that when
the proclamation had gone forth
among them they were exceedingly
afraid; yea, they feared to displease
the king, and they also feared to go
to battle against the Nephites lest
they should lose their lives. And it
came to pass that they would not,
or the more part of them would
not, obey the commandments of
the king.

3 And now it came to pass that
