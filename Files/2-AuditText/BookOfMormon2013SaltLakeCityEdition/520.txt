28 Behold, I will show unto the
Gentiles their weakness, and I will
show unto them that faith, hope
and charity bringeth unto me.the
fountain of all righteousness.

29 And I, Moroni, having heard
these words, was comforted, and
said: O Lord, thy righteous will be
done, for I know that thou workest
unto the children of men according
to their faith;

30 For the brother of Jared said
unto the mountain Zerin, Re-
move.and it was removed. And if
he had not had faith it would not
have moved; wherefore thou work-
est after men have faith.

31 For thus didst thou manifest
thyself unto thy disciples; for after
they had faith, and did speak in
thy name, thou didst show thyself
unto them in great power.

32 And also remember that thou
hast said that thou hast prepared a
house for man, yea, even among the
@mansions of thy Father, in which
man might have a more excellent
hope; wherefore man must hope,
or he cannot receive an inheri-
tance in the place which thou hast
prepared.

33 And again, I remember that
thou hast said that thou hast loved
the world, even unto the laying
down of thy life for the world, that
thou mightest take it again to pre-
pare a place for the children of men.

34 And now I know that this love
which thou hast had for the chil-
dren of men is charity; wherefore,
except men shall have charity they
cannot inherit that place which thou

 

hast prepared in the mansions of
thy Father.

35 Wherefore, I know by this thing
which thou hast said, that if the
Gentiles have not charity, because
of our weakness, that thou wilt
prove them, and take away their
talent, yea, even that which they
have received, and give unto them
who shall have more abundantly.

36 And it came to pass that I prayed
unto the Lord that he would give unto
the Gentiles grace, that they might
have charity.

37 And it came to pass that the
Lord said unto me: If they have not
charity it mattereth not unto thee,
thou hast been faithful; wherefore,
thy garments shall be made clean.
And because thou hast seen thy
â€™weakness thou shalt be made strong,
even unto the sitting down in the
place which I have prepared in
the mansions of my Father.

38 And now I, Moroni, bid farewell
unto the Gentiles, yea, and also unto
my brethren whom  love, until we
shall meet before the judgment-
seat of Christ, where all men shall
know that my garments are not
spotted with your blood.

39 And then shall ye know that I
have seen Jesus, and that he hath
talked with me face to face, and
that he told me in plain humility,
even as a man telleth another in
mine own language, concerning
these things;

40 And only a few have I written,
because of my weakness in writing.

41 And now, I would commend
you to 4seek this Jesus of whom the
