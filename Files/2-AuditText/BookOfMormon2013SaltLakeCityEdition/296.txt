25 Yea, and he also saw that their
hearts were lifted up unto great
boasting, in their pride.

26 And he lifted up his voice to
heaven, and cried, saying: O, how
long, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that
thy servants shall dwell here below
in the flesh, to behold such gross
wickedness among the children of
men?

27 Behold, O God, they cry unto
thee, and yet their hearts are swal-
lowed up in their pride. Behold, O
God, they cry unto thee with their
mouths, while they are puffed up,
even to greatness, with the vain
things of the world.

28 Behold, O my God, their costly
apparel, and their ringlets, and their
bracelets, and their ornaments of
gold, and all their precious things
which they are ornamented with;
and behold, their hearts are set upon
them, and yet they cry unto thee
and say.We thank thee, O God, for
we are a chosen people unto thee,
while others shall perish.

29 Yea, and they say that thou hast
made it known unto them that there
shall be no Christ.

30 O Lord God, how long wilt thou
suffer that such wickedness and in-
fidelity shall be among this people?
O Lord, wilt thou give me strength,
that I may bear with mine infir-
mities. For  am infirm, and such
wickedness among this people doth
pain my soul.

31 OLord, my heart is exceedingly
sorrowful; wilt thou comfort my soul
4in Christ. O Lord, wilt thou grant
unto me that I may have strength,
that I may suffer with patience
these afflictions which shall come
upon me, because of the iniquity
of this people.

 

32 O Lord, wilt thou comfort my
soul, and give unto me success, and
also my fellow Laborers who are with
me.yea, Ammon, and Aaron, and
Omner, and also Amulek and Zeez-
rom, and also my two sons.yea,
even all these wilt thou comfort, O
Lord. Yea, wilt thou comfort their
souls in Christ.

33 Wilt thou grant unto them that
they may have strength, that they
may bear their afflictions which
shall come upon them because of
the iniquities of this people.

34 O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us
that we may have success in bring-
ing them again unto thee in Christ.

35 Behold, O Lord, their souls are
precious, and many of them are
our brethren; therefore, give unto
us, O Lord, power and wisdom that
we may bring these, our brethren,
again unto thee.

36 Now it came to pass that when
Alma had said these words, that
he clapped his hands upon all
them who were with him. And be-
hold, as he clapped his hands upon
them, they were filled with the
Holy Spirit.

37 And after that they did sepa-
rate themselves one from another,
taking no thought for themselves
what they should eat, or what they
should drink, or what they should
put on.

38 And the Lord provided for
them that they should hunger not,
neither should they thirst; yea,
and he also gave them strength,
that they should suffer no manner
of afflictions, save it were swal-
lowed up in the joy of Christ. Now
this was according to the prayer of
Alma; and this because he prayed
in faith.
