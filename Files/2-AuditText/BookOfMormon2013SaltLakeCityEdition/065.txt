life; yea, and he hath suffered much
sorrow because of you.

25 And I exceedingly fear and
tremble because of you, lest he
shall suffer again; for behold, ye
have accused him that he sought
power and authority over you; but
1 know that he hath not sought for
power nor authority over you, but
he hath sought the glory of God,
and your own eternal welfare.

26 And ye have murmured because
he hath been plain unto you. Ye
say that he hath used sharpness;
ye say that he hath been angry
with you; but behold, his sharpness
was the sharpness of the power of
the word of God, which was in him;
and that which ye call anger was
the truth, according to that which
is in God, which he could not re-
strain, manifesting boldly concern-
ing your iniquities.

27 And it must needs be that the
power of God must be with him,
even unto his commanding you
that ye must obey. But behold, it
was not he, but it was the Spirit of
the Lord which was in him, which
opened his mouth to utterance that
he could not shut it.

28 And now my son, Laman, and
also Lemuel and Sam, and also my
sons who are the sons of Ishmael,
behold, if ye will hearken unto the
voice of Nephi ye shall not perish.
And if ye will hearken unto him
I leave unto you a blessing, yea,
even my first blessing.

29 But if ye will not hearken unto
him I take away my first blessing,
yea, even my blessing, and it shall
rest upon him.

30 And now, Zoram, I speak unto
you: Behold, thou art the servant
of Laban; nevertheless, thou hast

 

been brought out of the land of Je-
rusalem, and I know that thou art
a true friend unto my son, Nephi,
forever.

31 Wherefore, because thou hast
been faithful thy seed shall be
blessed with his seed, that they
dwell in prosperity long upon the
face of this land; and nothing, save it
shall be iniquity among them, shall
harm or disturb their prosperity
upon the face of this land forever.

32 Wherefore, if ye shall keep the
commandments of the Lord, the
Lord hath consecrated this land
for the security of thy seed with
the seed of my son.

CHAPTER 2

essential to existence and progression.
Adam fell that men might be.Men are
free to choose liberty and eternal life.

AND now, Jacob, I speak unto you:
Thou art my firstborn in the days
of my tribulation in the wilderness.
And behold, in thy childhood thou
hast suffered afflictions and much
sorrow, because of the rudeness of
thy brethren.

2 Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn
in the wilderness, thou knowest
the greatness of God; and he shall
consecrate thine afflictions for
thy gain.

3 Wherefore, thy soul shall be
blessed, and thou shalt dwell safely
with thy brother, Nephi; and thy
days shall be spent in the service
of thy God. Wherefore, I know that
thou art redeemed, because of the
righteousness of thy Redeemer; for
thou hast beheld that in the fulness
