as in the time that he should mani-
fest himself unto the children of
men.

18 For he is the same yesterday,
today, and forever; and the way is
prepared for all men from the foun-
dation of the world, if it so be that
they repent and come unto him.

19 For he that diligently seeketh
shall find; and the mysteries of God
shall be unfolded unto them, by the
power of the Holy Ghost, as well in
these times as in times of old, and
as well in times of old as in times
to come; wherefore, the course of
the Lord is one eternal round.

20 Therefore remember, O man,
for all thy doings thou shalt be
brought into judgment.

21 Wherefore, if ye have sought
to do wickedly in the days of your
â€™probation, then ye are found un-
clean before the judgment-seat of
God; and no unclean thing can dwell
with God; wherefore, ye must be
cast off forever.

22 And the Holy Ghost giveth au-
thority that I should speak these
things, and deny them not.

the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an
exceedingly high mountain, which
I never had before seen, and upon
which I never had before set my foot.

2 And the Spirit said unto me: Be-
hold, what desirest thou?

3 And I said: I desire to behold
the things which my father saw.

4 And the Spirit said unto me:
Believest thou that thy father saw
the tree of which he hath spoken?

5 And I said: Yea, thou knowest
that I believe all the words of my
father.

6 And when I had spoken these
words, the Spirit cried with a loud
voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord,

over all the earth, yea, even above
all. And blessed art thou, Nephi,
