33 Wherefore, if they should die
in their wickedness they must be
’cast off also, as to the things which
are spiritual, which are pertaining
to righteousness; wherefore, they
must be brought to stand before
God, to be judged of their works;
and if their works have been filthi-
ness they must needs be filthy; and
if they be filthy it must needs be
that they cannot dwell in the king-
dom of God; if so, the kingdom of
God must be filthy also.

34 But behold, I say unto you, the
kingdom of God is not filthy, and
there cannot any unclean thing
enter into the kingdom of God;
wherefore there must needs be a
place of filthiness prepared for
that which is filthy.

35 And there is a place prepared,
yea, even that awful hell of which
Ihave spoken, and the devil is the
preparator of it; wherefore the fi-
nal state of the souls of men is to
dwell in the kingdom of God, or to
be cast out because of that justice
of which I have spoken.

36 Wherefore, the wicked are re-
jected from the righteous, and also
from that tree of life, whose fruit is
most precious and most desirable
above all other fruits; yea, and it is
the greatest of all the gifts of God.
And thus I spake unto my brethren.
Amen.

CHAPTER 16

The wicked take the truth to be hard.
Lehi’s sons marry the daughters of

 

Ishmael.The Liahona guides their
course in the wilderness.Messages
from the Lord are written on the Lia-
hona from time to time.Ishmael dies;
his family murmurs because of afflic-
tions. About 600-592 B.c.

AND now it came to pass that after I,
Nephi, had made an end of speaking
to my brethren, behold they said
unto me: Thou hast declared unto
us hard things, more than we are
able to bear.

2 And it came to pass that I said
unto them that I knew that I had
spoken hard things against the
wicked, according to the truth;
and the righteous have I justified,
and testified that they should be
lifted up at the last day; where-
fore, the guilty taketh the truth
to be hard, for it cutteth them to
the very center.

3 And now my brethren, if ye
were righteous and were willing to
hearken to the truth, and give heed
unto it, that ye might walk up-
rightly before God, then ye would
not murmur because of the truth,
and say: Thou speakest hard things
against us.

4 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,
did exhort my brethren, with all
diligence, to keep the command-
ments of the Lord.

5 And it came to pass that they
did humble themselves before the
Lord; insomuch that I had joy and
great hopes of them, that they would
walk in the paths of righteousness.

6 Now, all these things were said
