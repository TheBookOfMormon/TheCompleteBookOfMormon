CHAPTER 3

Joseph in Egypt saw the Nephites in vi-
sion.He prophesied of Joseph Smith,
the latter-day seer; of Moses, who would
deliver Israel; and of the coming forth of
the Book of Mormon. About 588-570 B.C.

AND now I speak unto you, Joseph,
my last-born. Thou wast born in
the wilderness of mine afflictions;
yea, in the days of my greatest sor-
row did thy mother bear thee.

2 And may the Lord consecrate
also unto thee this land, which is
a most precious land, for thine in-
heritance and the inheritance of
thy seed with thy brethren, for thy
security forever, if it so be that ye
shall keep the commandments of
the Holy One of Israel.

3 And now, Joseph, my last-born,
whom I have brought out of the
wilderness of mine afflictions, may
the Lord bless thee forever, for thy
4seed shall not utterly be destroyed.

4 For behold, thou art the fruit of
my loins; and lama descendant of
Joseph who was carried captive
into Egypt. And great were the cov-
enants of the Lord which he made
unto Joseph.

5 Wherefore, Joseph truly saw our
day. And he obtained a promise
of the Lord, that out of the fruit of
his loins the Lord God would raise

 

up a righteous branch unto the
house of Israel; not the Messiah, but
a branch which was to be broken
off, nevertheless, to be remembered
in the covenants of the Lord that
the Messiah should be made mani-
fest unto them in the latter days, in
the spirit of power, unto the bring-
ing of them out of darkness unto
light.yea, out of hidden darkness
and out of captivity unto freedom.

6 For Joseph truly testified, say-
ing: A seer shall the Lord my God
raise up, who shall be a choice seer
unto the fruit of my loins.

7 Yea, Joseph truly said: Thus saith
the Lord unto me: A choice seer
will  raise up out of the fruit of
thy loins; and he shall be esteemed
highly among the fruit of thy loins.
And unto him will I give command-
ment that he shall do a work for
the fruit of thy loins, his brethren,
which shall be of great worth unto
them, even to the bringing of them
to the knowledge of the covenants
which I have made with thy fathers.

8 And I will give unto him a com-
mandment that he shall do none
other work, save the work which
I shall command him. And I will
make him great in mine eyes; for
he shall do my work.

9 And he shall be great like unto
Moses, whom I have said I would
raise up unto you, to deliver my
people, O house of Israel.

10 And Moses will I raise up, to
deliver thy people out of the land of
Egypt.

11 But a seer will I raise up out
