AND it came to pass that Jesus com-
manded his disciples that they
should bring forth some bread and
wine unto him.

2 And while they were gone for
bread and wine, he commanded
the multitude that they should sit
themselves down upon the earth.

3 And when the disciples had come
with bread and wine, he took of
the bread and brake and blessed it;
and he gave unto the disciples and
commanded that they should eat.

4 And when they had eaten and
were filled, he commanded that
they should give unto the multitude.

5 And when the multitude had
eaten and were filled, he said unto
the disciples: Behold there shall one
be ordained among you, and to
him will I give power that he shall
>break bread and bless it and give
it unto the people of my church,
unto all those who shall believe and
be baptized in my name.

6 And this shall ye always observe
to do, even as I have done, even as
Ihave broken bread and blessed it
and given it unto you.

7 And this shall ye do in 4remem-
brance of my body, which I have
shown unto you. And it shall be
a testimony unto the Father that
ye do always remember me. And if ye
do always remember me ye shall
have my Spirit to be with you.

8 And it came to pass that when

 

he said these words, he commanded
his disciples that they should take
of the wine of the cup and drink
of it, and that they should also give
unto the multitude that they might
drink of it.

9 And it came to pass that they
did so, and did drink of it and were
filled; and they gave unto the mul-
titude, and they did drink, and they
were filled.

10 And when the disciples had
done this, Jesus said unto them:
Blessed are ye for this thing which
ye have done, for this is fulfilling
my commandments, and this doth
witness unto the Father that ye are
willing to do that which I have
commanded you.

11 And this shall ye always do to
those who repent and are baptized
in my name; and ye shall do it in
4remembrance of my blood, which
I have shed for you, that ye may
witness unto the Father that ye do
always remember me. And if ye
do always remember me ye shall
have my Spirit to be with you.

12 And I give unto you a com-
mandment that ye shall do these
things. And if ye shall always do
these things blessed are ye, for ye
are built upon my rock.

13 But whoso among you shall
do more or less than these are not
built upon my rock, but are built
upon. a sandy foundation; and when
the rain descends, and the floods
come, and the winds blow, and beat
upon them, they shall fall, and the
gates of hell are ready open to re-
ceive them.

14 Therefore blessed are ye if ye
shall keep my commandments,
which the Father hath commanded
me that I should give unto you.
