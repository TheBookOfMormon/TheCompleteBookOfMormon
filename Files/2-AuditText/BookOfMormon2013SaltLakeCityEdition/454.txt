4 And it came to pass that on the
morrow, when the multitude was
gathered together, behold, Nephi
and his brother whom he had raised
from the dead, whose name was
Timothy, and also his son, whose
name was Jonas, and also Mathoni,
and Mathonihah, his brother, and
Kumen, and Kumenonhi, and Jere-
miah, and Shemnon, and Jonas,
and Zedekiah, and Isaiah.now
these were the names of the dis-
ciples whom Jesus had chosen.
and it came to pass that they went
forth and stood in the midst of the
multitude.

5 And behold, the multitude was
so great that they did cause that
they should be separated into twelve
bodies.

6 And the twelve did teach the
multitude; and behold, they did
cause that the multitude should
kneel down upon the face of the
earth, and should pray unto the
Father in the name of Jesus.

7 And the disciples did pray unto
the Father also in the name of Jesus.
And it came to pass that they arose
and ministered unto the people.

8 And when they had ministered
those same words which Jesus had
spoken.nothing varying from the
words which Jesus had spoken.be-
hold, they knelt again and prayed
to the Father in the name of Jesus.

9 And they did pray for that which
they most desired; and they desired
that the Holy Ghost should be given
unto them.

10 And when they had thus prayed
they went down unto the water’s
edge, and the multitude followed
them.

11 And it came to pass that Nephi
went down into the water and was
’baptized.

12 And he came up out of the

 

water and began to baptize. And
he baptized all those whom Jesus
had chosen.

13 And it came to pass when they
were all baptized and had come up
out of the water, the Holy Ghost
did fall upon them, and they were
filled with the Holy Ghost and
with fire.

14 And behold, they were en-
circled about as if it were by fire;
and it came down from heaven, and
the multitude did witness it, and did
bear record; and angels did come
down out of heaven and did min-
ister unto them.

15 And it came to pass that while
the angels were ministering unto
the disciples, behold, Jesus came
and stood in the midst and minis-
tered unto them.

16 And it came to pass that he
spake unto the multitude, and
commanded them that they should
kneel down again upon the earth,
and also that his disciples should
kneel down upon the earth.

17 And it came to pass that when
they had all knelt down upon the
earth, he commanded his disciples
that they should pray.

18 And behold, they began to
pray; and they did pray unto Jesus,
calling him their Lord and their
God.

19 And it came to pass that Jesus
departed out of the midst of them,
and went a little way off from
them and bowed himself to the
earth, and he said:

20 Father, I thank thee that thou
hast given the Holy Ghost unto these
whom I have chosen; and it is be-
cause of their belief in me that I
have chosen them out of the world.

21 Father, I pray thee that thou wilt
give the Holy Ghost unto all them
that shall believe in their words.
