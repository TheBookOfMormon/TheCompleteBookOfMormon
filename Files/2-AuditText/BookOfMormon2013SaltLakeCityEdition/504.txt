me that I should seal them up;
and he also hath commanded that
I should seal up the interpretation
thereof; wherefore I have sealed up
the interpreters, according to the
commandment of the Lord.

6 For the Lord said unto me: They
shall not go forth unto the Gentiles
until the day that they shall repent
of their iniquity, and become clean
before the Lord.

7 And in that day that they shall
exercise faith in me, saith the Lord,
even as the brother of Jared did, that
they may become sanctified in me,
then will 1 manifest unto them the
things which the brother of Jared
saw, even to the unfolding unto
them all my revelations, saith Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, the Father
of the heavens and of the earth, and
all things that in them are.

8 And he that will contend against
the word of the Lord, let him be
accursed; and he that shall deny
these things, let him be accursed;
for unto them will I show no greater
things, saith Jesus Christ; for 1 am
he who speaketh.

9 And at my command the heav-
ens are opened and are shut; and

Father hath laid up for you, from
the foundation of the world; and it
hath not come unto you, because of
