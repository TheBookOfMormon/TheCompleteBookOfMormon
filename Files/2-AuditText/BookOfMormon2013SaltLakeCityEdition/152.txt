ND now 1, Mormon, being about

to deliver up the record which

I have been making into the
hands of my son Moroni, behold I
have witnessed almost all the de-
struction of my people, the Nephites.

2 And it is many hundred years
after the coming of Christ that I de-
liver these records into the hands of
my son; and it supposeth me that he
will witness the entire destruction
of my people. But may God grant
that he may survive them, that he
may write somewhat concerning
them, and somewhat concerning
Christ, that perhaps some day it
may profit them.

3 And now, I speak somewhat con-
cerning that which I have written;
for after I had made an abridgment
from the plates of Nephi, down to

number, and took their journey
again into the wilderness.

30 And I, Amaleki, had a brother,
who also went with them; and I
have not since known concerning
them. And I am about to lie down
in my grave; and these plates are
full. And I make an end of my
speaking.

OF MORMON

the reign of this king Benjamin, of
whom Amaleki spake, I searched
among the records which had been
delivered into my hands, and I found
these plates, which contained this
small account of the prophets, from
Jacob down to the reign of this king
Benjamin, and also many of the
words of Nephi.

4 And the things which are upon
these plates pleasing me, because
of the prophecies of the coming of
Christ; and my fathers knowing that
many of them have been fulfilled;
yea, and I also know that as many
things as have been prophesied
concerning us down to this day
have been fulfilled, and as many
as go beyond this day must surely
come to pass.

5 Wherefore, I chose these things,
to finish my record upon them,
which remainder of my record I
shall take from the plates of Nephi;
and I cannot write the hundredth
part of the things of my people.

6 But behold, I shall take these
