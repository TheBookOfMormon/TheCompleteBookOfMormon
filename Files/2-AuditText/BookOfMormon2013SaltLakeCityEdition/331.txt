of Nephi. And it came to pass that
they did appoint priests and teach-
ers throughout all the land, over all
the churches.

23 And now it came to pass that
after Helaman and his brethren
had appointed priests and teachers
over the churches that there arose a
dissension among them, and they
would not give heed to the words
of Helaman and his brethren;

24 But they grew proud, being
lifted up in their hearts, because
of their exceedingly great riches;
therefore they grew rich in their
own eyes, and would not give heed
to their words, to walk uprightly
before God.

CHAPTER 46

Amalickiah conspires to be king.Mo-
roni raises the title of liberty.He rallies
the people to defend their religion.
True believers are called Christians.A
remnant of Joseph will be preserved.
Amalickiah and the dissenters flee to
the land of Nephi.Those who will not
support the cause of freedom are put to
death. About 73-72 B.c.

AND it came to pass that as many
as would not hearken to the words
of Helaman and his brethren were
gathered together against their
brethren.

2 And now behold, they were ex-
ceedingly wroth, insomuch that
they were determined to slay them.

3 Now the leader of those who
were wroth against their brethren
was a large and a strong man; and
his name was Amalickiah.

4 And Amalickiah was desirous to
be a king; and those people who
were wroth were also desirous that

 

he should be their king; and they
were the greater part of them the
lower judges of the land, and they
were seeking for power.

5 And they had been led by the
flatteries of Amalickiah, that if they
would support him and establish
him to be their king that he would
make them rulers over the people.

6 Thus they were led away by
Amalickiah to dissensions, notwith-
standing the preaching of Helaman
and his brethren, yea, notwith-
standing their exceedingly great
care over the church, for they were
high priests over the church.

7 And there were many in the
church who believed in the flat-
tering words of Amalickiah, there-
fore they dissented even from the
church; and thus were the affairs
of the people of Nephi exceed-
ingly precarious and dangerous,
notwithstanding their great vic-
tory which they had had over the
Lamanites, and their great rejoic-
ings which they had had because
of their deliverance by the hand of
the Lord.

8 Thus we see how quick the chil-
dren of men do forget the Lord their
God, yea, how quick to do iniquity,
and to be led away by the evil one.

9 Yea, and we also see the great
wickedness one very wicked man
can cause to take place among the
children of men.

10 Yea, we see that Amalickiah,
because he was a man of cunning
device and a man of many flattering
words, that he led away the hearts
of many people to do wickedly; yea,
and to seek to destroy the church of
God, and to destroy the foundation
of liberty which God had granted
