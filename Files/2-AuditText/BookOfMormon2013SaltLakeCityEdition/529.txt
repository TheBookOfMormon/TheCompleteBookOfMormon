ask thee, in the name of thy Son,
Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify
this wine to the souls of all those
who drink of it, that they may do
it in remembrance of the blood of
thy Son, which was shed for them;
that they may witness unto thee, O
God, the Eternal Father, that they
do always remember him, that
they may have his Spirit to be with
them. Amen.

CHAPTER 6

Repentant persons are baptized and
fellowshipped.Church members who
repent are forgiven.Meetings are con-
ducted by the power of the Holy Ghost.
About A.D. 401-21.

AND now I speak concerning bap-
tism. Behold, elders, priests, and
teachers were baptized; and they
were not baptized save they brought
forth fruit meet that they were
oworthy of it.

2 Neither did they receive any unto
baptism save they came forth witha
broken heart and a contrite spirit,
and witnessed unto the church
that they truly repented of all
their sins.

3 And none were received unto
baptism save they took upon them
the name of Christ, having a deter-
mination to serve him to the end.

4 And after they had been received
unto baptism, and were wrought
upon and cleansed by the power of.
the Holy Ghost, they were numbered

 

among the people of the church
of Christ; and their names were
taken, that they might be remem-
bered and nourished by the good
word of God, to keep them in the
right way, to keep them continu-
ally watchful unto prayer, relying
alone upon the merits of Christ,
who was the author and the finisher
of their faith.

5 And the church did meet to-
gether oft, to fast and to pray, and
to speak one with another concern-
ing the welfare of their souls.

6 And they did meet together
oft to partake of bread and wine,
in remembrance of the Lord
Jesus.

7 And they were strict to observe
that there should be no iniquity
among them; and whoso was found
to commit iniquity, and three wit-
nesses of the church did condemn
them before the elders, and if they
repented not, and 4confessed not,
their names were blotted out, and
they were not numbered among
the people of Christ.

8 But as oft as they repented and
sought forgiveness, with real intent,
they were forgiven.

9 And their meetings were con-
ducted by the church after the man-
ner of the workings of the Spirit,
and by the power of the Holy Ghost;
for as the power of the Holy Ghost
led them whether to preach, or to
exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate,
or to sing, even so it was done.
