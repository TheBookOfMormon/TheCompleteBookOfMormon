come down unto the tent of our
father. And after Land my brethren
and all the house of Ishmael had come
down unto the tent of my father, they
did give thanks unto the Lord their
God; and they did offer sacrifice
and burnt offerings unto him.

CHAPTER 8

Lehi sees a vision of the tree of life.
He partakes of its fruit and desires his
family to do likewise.He sees a rod of
iron, a strait and narrow path, and the
mists of darkness that enshroud men.
Sariah, Nephi, and Sam partake of the
fruit, but Laman and Lemuel refuse.
About 600-592 B.c.

AND it came to pass that we had
gathered together all manner of
4seeds of every kind, both of grain
of every kind, and also of the seeds
of fruit of every kind.

2 And it came to pass that while
my father tarried in the wilderness
he spake unto us, saying: Behold, I
have dreamed a dream; or, in other
words, I have seen a vision.

3 And behold, because of the thing
which I have seen, I have reason to
rejoice in the Lord because of Nephi
and also of Sam; for I have reason
to suppose that they, and also many
of their seed, will be saved.

4 But behold, Laman and Lemuel,
I fear exceedingly because of you;
for behold, methought I saw in my
dream, a dark and dreary wilderness.

5 And it came to pass that I saw
a man, and he was dressed in a
white robe; and he came and stood
before me.

6 And it came to pass that he spake
unto me, and bade me follow him.

 

7 And it came to pass that as I
followed him I beheld myself that
I was in a dark and dreary waste.

8 And after I had traveled for the
space of many hours in darkness, I
began to pray unto the Lord that he
would have mercy on me, accord-

mercies.

9 And it came to pass after I had
prayed unto the Lord I beheld a
large and spacious field.

10 And it came to pass that I beheld
a tree, whose fruit was desirable
to make one happy.

11 And it came to pass that I did
go forth and partake of the fruit
thereof; and I beheld that it was most
sweet, above all that I ever before
tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the
fruit thereof was white, to exceed
all the whiteness that I had ever
seen.

12 And as I partook of the fruit
thereof it filled my soul with ex-
ceedingly great joy; wherefore, I
began to be desirous that my family
should partake of it also; for knew
that it was desirable above all other
fruit.

13 And as I cast my eyes round
about, that perhaps I might discover
my family also, I beheld a river of
water; and it ran along, and it was
near the tree of which I was par-
taking the fruit.

14 And I looked to behold from
whence it came; and I saw the head
thereof a little way off; and at the
head thereof I beheld your mother
Sariah, and Sam, and Nephi; and
they stood as if they knew not
whither they should go.

15 And it came to pass that I
