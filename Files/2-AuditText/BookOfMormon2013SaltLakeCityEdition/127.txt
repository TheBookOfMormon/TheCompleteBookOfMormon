people should be engraven upon his
other plates, and that I should pre-
serve these plates and hand them
down unto my seed, from generation
to generation.

4 And if there were preaching
which was sacred, or revelation
which was great, or prophesying,
that I should engraven the heads of
them upon these plates, and touch
upon them as much as it were pos-
sible, for Christâ€™s sake, and for the
sake of our people.

5 For because of faith and great
anxiety, it truly had been made
manifest unto us concerning our
people, what things should hap-
pen unto them.

6 And wealso had many revelations,
and the spirit of much prophecy;
wherefore, we knew of Christ and
his kingdom, which should come.

7 Wherefore we labored diligently
among our people, that we might
persuade them to come unto Christ,
and partake of the goodness of God,
that they might enter into his rest,
lest by any means he should swear
in his wrath they should not enter
in, as in the provocation in the days
of temptation while the children of
Israel were in the wilderness.

8 Wherefore, we would to God that
we could persuade all men not to
rebel against God, to provoke him
to anger, but that all men would be-
lieve in Christ, and view his death,
and suffer his cross and bear the
shame of the world; wherefore, I,

 

Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the
commandment of my brother Nephi.

9 Now Nephi began to be old,
and he saw that he must soon die;
wherefore, he anointed a man to be
a king and a ruler over his people
now, according to the reigns of the
ckings.

10 The people having loved Nephi
exceedingly, he having been a great
protector for them, having wielded
the sword of Laban in their defence,
and having labored in all his days
for their welfare.

11 Wherefore, the people were de-
sirous to retain in remembrance his
name. And whoso should reign in
his stead were called by the people,
second Nephi, third Nephi, and so
forth, according to the reigns of the
kings; and thus they were called by
the people, let them be of whatever
name they would.

12 And it came to pass that Nephi
died.

13 Now the people which were not
Lamanites were Nephites; never-
theless, they were called Nephites,
Jacobites, Josephites, Zoramites,
Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ish-
maelites.

14 But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter
distinguish them by these names,
but I shall call them Lamanites
that seek to destroy the people of
Nephi, and those who are friendly
to Nephi I shall call Nephites, or
the people of Nephi, according to
the reigns of the kings.
