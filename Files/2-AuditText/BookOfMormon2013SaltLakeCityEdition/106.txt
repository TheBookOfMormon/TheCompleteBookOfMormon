Messiah.He will first come six hundred
years after Lehi left Jerusalem.The
Nephites keep the law of Moses and
believe in Christ, who is the Holy One
of Israel. About 559-545 B.C.

Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat
concerning the words which I have
written, which have been spoken
by the mouth of Isaiah. For behold,
Isaiah spake many things which
were hard for many of my people
to understand; for they know not
concerning the manner of prophe-
sying among the Jews.

2 For I, Nephi, have not taught
them many things concerning the
manner of the Jews; for their works
were works of darkness, and their
doings were doings of abominations.

3 Wherefore, I write unto my peo-
ple, unto all those that shall receive
hereafter these things which I write,
that they may know the judgments
of God, that they come upon all na-
tions, according to the word which
he hath spoken.

4 Wherefore, hearken, O my peo-
ple, which are of the house of Is-
rael, and give ear unto my words;
for because the words of Isaiah are
not plain unto you, nevertheless
they are plain unto all those that
are filled with the spirit of proph-
ecy. But I give unto you aprophecy,
according to the spirit which is in
me; wherefore I shall prophesy ac-
cording to the plainness which hath
been with me from the time that I
came out from Jerusalem with my
father; for behold, my soul delight-
eth in plainness unto my people,
that they may learn.

5 Yea, and my soul delighteth in

 

the words of Isaiah, for I came out
from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath
beheld the things of the Jews, and
I know that the Jews do understand
the things of the prophets, and there
is none other people that under-
stand the things which were spoken
unto the Jews like unto them, save
it be that they are taught after the
manner of the things of the Jews.

6 But behold, I, Nephi, have not
taught my children after the man-
ner of the Jews; but behold, I, of
myself, have dwelt at Jerusalem,
wherefore I know concerning the
regions round about; and I have
made mention unto my children
concerning the judgments of God,
which hath come to pass among the
Jews, unto my children, according
to all that which Isaiah hath spo-
ken, and I do not write them.

7 But behold, I proceed with mine
own prophecy, according to my
4plainness; in the which I know
that no man can err; nevertheless,
in the days that the prophecies of
Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall
know ofa surety, at the times when
they shall come to pass.

8 Wherefore, they are of worth
unto the children of men, and he
that supposeth that they are not,
unto them will I speak particularly,
and confine the words unto mine
â€™own people; for I know that they
shall be of great worth unto them in
the last days; for in that day shall
they understand them; wherefore,
for their good have I written them.

9 And as one generation hath
been destroyed among the Jews be-
cause of iniquity, even so have they
been destroyed from generation to
