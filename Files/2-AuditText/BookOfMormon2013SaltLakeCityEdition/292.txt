the commencement of the reign of
the judges until now, with mine
own hands for my support, notwith-
standing my many travels round
about the land to declare the word
of God unto my people.

33 And notwithstanding the many
labors which I have performed in
the church, I have never received
so much as even one senine for my
labor; neither has any of my breth-
ren, save it were in the judgment-
seat; and then we have received
only according to law for our time.

34 And now, if we do not receive
anything for our labors in the
church, what doth it profit us to
labor in the church save it were to
declare the truth, that we may have
rejoicings in the joy of our brethren?

35 Then why sayest thou that we
preach unto this people to get gain,
when thou, of thyself, knowest that
we receive no gain? And now, be-
lievest thou that we deceive this
people, that causes such joy in
their hearts?

36 And Korihor answered him, Yea.

37 And then Alma said unto him:
Believest thou that there is a God?

38 And he answered, Nay.

39 Now Alma said unto him: Willye
deny again that there is a God, and
also deny the Christ? For behold, I
say unto you, I know there is a God,
and also that Christ shall come.

40 And now what evidence have ye
that there is no God, or that Christ
cometh not? I say unto you that ye
have none, save it be your word only.

41 But, behold, I have all things as
a testimony that these things are
true; and ye also have all things
as a testimony unto you that they
are true; and will ye deny them?

 

Believest thou that these things
are true?

42 Behold, I know that thou be-
lievest, but thou art possessed with
a lying spirit, and ye have put
off the Spirit of God that it may
have no place in you; but the devil
has power over you, and he doth
carry you about, working devices
that he may destroy the children
of God.

43 And now Korihor said unto
Alma: If thou wilt show me a sign,
that I may be convinced that there
is a God, yea, show unto me that he
hath power, and then willI be con-
vinced of the truth of thy words.

44 But Alma said unto him: Thou
hast had signs enough; will ye tempt
your God? Will ye say, Show unto
me a sign, when ye have the tes-
timony of all these thy brethren,
and also all the holy prophets? The
scriptures are laid before thee, yea,
and all things denote there is a
God; yea, even the earth, and all
things that are upon the face of it,
yea, and its motion, yea, and also
all the planets which move in their
regular form do witness that there
is a Supreme Creator.

45 And yet do ye go about, lead-
ing away the hearts of this people,
testifying unto them there is no
God? And yet will ye deny against
all these witnesses? And he said:
Yea, I will deny, except ye shall show
me a sign.

46 And now it came to pass that
Alma said unto him: Behold, I am
grieved because of the hardness of
your heart, yea, that ye will still re-
sist the spirit of the truth, that thy
soul may be destroyed.

47 But behold, it is better that thy
