are they found no more blameless
in the sight of God, only according
to the words which I have spoken
unto thee.

23 And now I have spoken the
words which the Lord God hath
commanded me.

24 And thus saith the Lord: They
shall stand as a bright testimony
against this people, at the judgment
day; whereof they shall be judged,
every man according to his works,
whether they be good, or whether
they be evil.

25 And if they be evil they are
consigned to an awful view of their
own guilt and abominations, which
doth cause them to shrink from the
presence of the Lord into a state of
misery and endless torment, from
whence they can no more return;
therefore they have drunk damna-
tion to their own souls.

26 Therefore, they have drunk out
of the cup of the wrath of God,
which justice could no more deny
unto them than it could deny that
Adam should fall because of his
partaking of the forbidden fruit;
therefore, mercy could have claim
on them no more forever.

27 And their torment is asa lake
of fire and brimstone, whose flames
are unquenchable, and whose smoke
ascendeth up forever and ever.
Thus hath the Lord commanded
me. Amen.

CHAPTER 4

King Benjamin continues his address.
Salvation comes because of the Atonement
.Believe in God to be saved.Retain

 

a remission of your sins through faith-
fulness.Impart of your substance to
the poor.Do all things in wisdom and
order. About 124 B.c.

AND now, it came to pass that when
king Benjamin had made an end
of speaking the words which had
been delivered unto him by the
angel of the Lord, that he cast his
eyes round about on the multitude,
and behold they had fallen to the
earth, for the fear of the Lord had
come upon them.

2 And they had viewed themselves
in their own carnal state, even less
than the dust of the earth. And they
all cried aloud with one voice, say-
ing: O have mercy, and apply the
atoning blood of Christ that we may
receive forgiveness of our sins, and
our hearts may be purified; for we
believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of
God, who created heaven and earth,
and all things; who shall come down
among the children of men.

3 And it came to pass that af-
ter they had spoken these words
the Spirit of the Lord came upon
them, and they were filled with
joy, having received a remission
of their sins, and having peace of
â€™conscience, because of the exceed-
ing faith which they had in Jesus
Christ who should come, according
to the words which king Benjamin
had spoken unto them.

4 And king Benjamin again opened.
his mouth and began to speak
unto them, saying: My friends and
my brethren, my kindred and my
people, I would again call your
attention, that ye may hear and
