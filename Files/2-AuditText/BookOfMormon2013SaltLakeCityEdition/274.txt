prostrate himself upon the earth,
and cried mightily, saying:

18 O God, Aaron hath told me that
there is a God; and if there is aGod,
and if thou art God, wilt thou make
thyself known unto me, and I will
give away all my sins to know thee,
and that I may be raised from the
dead, and be saved at the last day.
And now when the king had said
these words, he was struck as if he
were dead.

19 And it came to pass that his
servants ran and told the queen all
that had happened unto the king.
And she came in unto the king; and
when she saw him lay as if he were
dead, and also Aaron and his breth-
ren standing as though they had
been the cause of his fall, she was
angry with them, and commanded
that her servants, or the servants
of the king, should take them and
slay them.

20 Now the servants had seen the
cause of the king’s fall, therefore
they durst not lay their hands on
Aaron and his brethren; and they
pled with the queen saying: Why
commandest thou that we should
slay these men, when behold one
of them is mightier than us all?
Therefore we shall fall before them.

21 Now when the queen saw the
fear of the servants she also be-
gan to fear exceedingly, lest there
should some evil come upon her.
And she commanded her servants
that they should go and call the
people, that they might slay Aaron
and his brethren.

22 Now when Aaron saw the de-
termination of the queen, he, also
knowing the hardness of the hearts
of the people, feared lest that a
multitude should assemble them-
selves together, and there should
be a great contention and a distur-
bance among them; therefore he

 

put forth his hand and raised the
king from the earth, and said unto
him: Stand. And he stood upon his
feet, receiving his strength.

23 Now this was done in the pres-
ence of the queen and many of the
servants. And when they saw it
they greatly marveled, and began
to fear. And the king stood forth,
and began to minister unto them.
And he did minister unto them, in-
somuch that his whole household
were converted unto the Lord.

24 Now there was a multitude
gathered together because of the
commandment of the queen, and
there began to be great murmur-
ings among them because of Aaron
and his brethren.

25 But the king stood forth among
them and administered unto them.
And they were pacified towards
Aaron and those who were with him.

26 And it came to pass that when
the king saw that the people were
pacified, he caused that Aaron and
his brethren should stand forth in the
midst of the multitude, and that they
should preach the word unto them.

27 And it came to pass that the
king sent a proclamation through-
out all the land, amongst all his
people who were in all his land,
who were in all the regions round
about, which was bordering even
to the sea, on the east and on the
’west, and which was divided from
the land of Zarahemla by a narrow
strip of wilderness, which ran from
the sea east even to the sea west,
and round about on the borders of
the seashore, and the borders of the
wilderness which was on the north
by the land of Zarahemla, through
the borders of Manti, by the head
of the river Sidon, running from
the east towards the west.and
thus were the Lamanites and the
Nephites divided.
