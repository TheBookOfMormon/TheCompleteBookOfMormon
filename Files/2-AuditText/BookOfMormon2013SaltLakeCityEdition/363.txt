had been sent out to watch the camp
of the Lamanites.

31 And they cried unto us, say-
ing.Behold, the armies of the La-
manites are marching towards the
city of Cumeni; and behold, they
will fall upon them, yea, and will
destroy our people.

32 And it came to pass that our
prisoners did hear their cries, which
caused them to take courage; and
they did rise up in rebellion against
us.

33 And it came to pass because of
their rebellion we did cause that
our swords should come upon them.
And it came to pass that they did
in a body run upon our swords, in
the which, the greater number of
them were slain; and the remainder
of them broke through and fled
from us.

34 And behold, when they had fled
and we could not overtake them, we
took our march with speed towards
the city Cumeni; and behold, we did
arrive in time that we might assist
our brethren in preserving the city.

35 And behold, we are again de-
livered out of the hands of our en-
emies. And blessed is the name of
our God; for behold, it is he that
has delivered us; yea, that has done
this great thing for us.

36 Now it came to pass that when
I, Helaman, had heard these words
of Gid, I was filled with exceeding
joy because of the goodness of God
in preserving us, that we might
not all perish; yea, and I trust that
the souls of them who have been
slain have entered into the rest of
their God.

CHAPTER 58

Helaman, Gid, and Teomner take the
city of Manti by a stratagem.The
Lamanites withdraw.The sons of the
people of Ammon are preserved as they
stand fast in defense of their liberty and
faith. About 63-62 B.c.

 

AND behold, now it came to pass
that our next object was to obtain
the city of Manti; but behold, there
was no way that we could lead them
out of the city by our small bands.
For behold, they remembered that
which we had hitherto done; there-
fore we could not decoy them away
from their strongholds.

2 And they were so much more
numerous than was our army that
we durst not go forth and attack
them in their strongholds.

3 Yea, and it became expedient
that we should employ our men to
the maintaining those parts of the
land which we had regained of our
possessions; therefore it became ex-
pedient that we should wait, that we
might receive more strength from
the land of Zarahemla and also a
new supply of provisions.

4 And it came to pass that I thus
did send an embassy to the governor
of our land, to acquaint him con-
cerning the affairs of our people.
And it came to pass that we did wait
to receive provisions and strength
from the land of Zarahemla.

5 But behold, this did profit us but
little; for the Lamanites were also
receiving great strength from day
to day, and also many provisions;
and thus were our circumstances
at this period of time.

6 And the Lamanites were sallying
forth against us from time to time,
resolving by stratagem to destroy us;
nevertheless we could not come to
battle with them, because of their
retreats and their strongholds.

7 And it came to pass that we did
wait in these difficult circumstances
for the space of many months, even
until we were about to perish for
the want of food.

8 But it came to pass that we did
receive food, which was guarded to
us by an army of two thousand men
to our assistance; and this is all the
assistance which we did receive, to
defend ourselves and our country
