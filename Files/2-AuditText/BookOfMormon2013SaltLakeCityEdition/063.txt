with me should be a land for the
inheritance of my seed. Yea, the
Lord hath covenanted this land
unto me, and to my children for-
ever, and also all those who should
be led out of other countries by the
hand of the Lord.

6 Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy
according to the workings of the
Spirit which is in me, that there
shall none come into this land save
they shall be brought by the hand
of the Lord.

7 Wherefore, this land is conse-
crated unto him whom he shall
bring. And if it so be that they shall
serve him according to the com-
mandments which he hath given,
it shall be a land of liberty unto
them; wherefore, they shall never
be brought down into captivity; if
so, it shall be because of iniquity;
for if iniquity shall abound cursed
shall be the land for their sakes,
but unto the righteous it shall be
blessed forever.

8 And behold, it is wisdom that
this land should be kept as yet from.
the knowledge of other nations; for
behold, many nations would over-
run the land, that there would be
no place for an inheritance.

9 Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained
a promise, that inasmuch as those
whom the Lord God shall bring out
of the land of Jerusalem shall keep
his commandments, they shall pros-
per upon the face of this land; and
they shall be kept from all other
nations, that they may possess this
land unto themselves. And if it so be
that they shall keep his command-
ments they shall be blessed upon
the face of this land, and there shall

 

be none to molest them, nor to take
away the land of their inheritance;
and they shall dwell safely forever.

10 But behold, when the time
cometh that they shall dwindle in
unbelief, after they have received
so great blessings from the hand of
the Lord.having a knowledge of
the creation of the earth, and all
men, knowing the great and mar-
velous works of the Lord from the
creation of the world; having power
given them to do all things by faith;
having all the commandments from
the beginning, and having been
brought by his infinite goodness
into this precious land of promise.
behold, I say, if the day shall come
that they will reject the Holy One
of Israel, the true Messiah, their
Redeemer and their God, behold,
the judgments of him that is just
shall rest upon them.

11 Yea, he will bring other na-
tions unto them, and he will give
unto them power, and he will take
away from them the lands of their
possessions, and he will cause them
to be scattered and smitten.

12 Yea, as one generation passeth
to another there shall be blood-
sheds, and great visitations among
them; wherefore, my sons, I would
that ye would remember; yea, I
would that ye would hearken unto
my words.

13 O that ye would awake; awake
from a deep sleep, yea, even from
the sleep of hell, and shake off
the awful chains by which ye are
bound, which are the chains which
bind the children of men, that they
are carried away captive down to the
eternal gulf of misery and woe.
