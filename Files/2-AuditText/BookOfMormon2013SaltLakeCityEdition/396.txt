behold he doth condemn all this
people, even unto destruction; yea,
and also that these our great cit-
ies shall be taken from us, that we
shall have no place in them.

6 And now we know that this is
impossible, for behold, we are pow-
erful, and our cities great, therefore
our enemies can have no power
over us.

7 And it came to pass that thus
they did stir up the people to anger
against Nephi, and raised conten-
tions among them; for there were
some who did cry out: Let this man
alone, for he is a good man, and
those things which he saith will
surely come to pass except we repent;

8 Yea, behold, all the judgments
will come upon us which he has
testified unto us; for we know that
he has testified aright unto us con-
cerning our iniquities. And behold
they are many, and he knoweth as
well all things which shall befall
us as he knoweth of our iniquities;

9 Yea, and behold, if he had not
been a prophet he could not have
testified concerning those things.

10 And it came to pass that those
people who sought to destroy Nephi
were compelled because of their fear,
that they did not lay their hands
on him; therefore he began again
to speak unto them, seeing that
he had gained favor in the eyes of
some, insomuch that the remainder
of them did fear.

11 Therefore he was constrained
to speak more unto them saying:
Behold, my brethren, have ye not
read that God gave power unto one
man, even Moses, to smite upon the
waters of the Red Sea, and they
parted hither and thither, insomuch

 

that the Israelites, who were our
fathers, came through upon dry
ground, and the waters closed upon
the armies of the Egyptians and
swallowed them up?

12 And now behold, if God gave
unto this man such power, then
why should ye dispute among your-
selves, and say that he hath given
unto me no power whereby I may
know concerning the judgments
that shall come upon you except
ye repent?

13 But, behold, ye not only deny
my words, but ye also deny all the
words which have been spoken
by our fathers, and also the words
which were spoken by this man,
Moses, who had such great power
given unto him, yea, the words
which he hath spoken concerning
the coming of the Messiah.

14 Yea, did he not bear record that
the Son of God should come? And
as he lifted up the brazen serpent
in the wilderness, even so shall he
be lifted up who should come.

15 And as many as should look
upon that serpent should live, even
so as many as should look upon the
Son of God with faith, having a con-
trite spirit, might live, even unto
that life which is eternal.

16 And now behold, Moses did
not only testify of these things, but
also all the holy prophets, from his
days even to the days of Abraham.

17 Yea, and behold, Abraham saw
of his coming, and was filled with
gladness and did rejoice.

18 Yea, and behold I say unto you,
that Abraham not only knew of
these things, but there were many
before the days of Abraham who
were called by the order of God;
