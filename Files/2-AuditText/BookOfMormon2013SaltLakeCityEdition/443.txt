they love to pray, standing in the
synagogues and in the corners of
the streets, that they may be seen
of men. Verily I say unto you, they
have their reward.

6 But thou, when thou prayest,
enter into thy closet, and when
thou hast shut thy door, pray to
thy Father who is in secret; and thy
Father, who seeth in secret, shall
reward thee openly.

7 But when ye pray, use not vain
repetitions, as the heathen, for they
think that they shall be heard for
their much speaking.

8 Be not ye therefore like unto
them, for your Father knoweth
what things ye have need of before
ye ask him.

9 After this manner therefore
â€™pray ye: Our Father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

10 Thy will be done on earth as it
is in heaven.

11 And forgive us our debts, as we
forgive our debtors.

12 And lead us not into tempta-
tion, but deliver us from evil.

13 For thine is the kingdom, and the
power, and the glory, forever. Amen.

14 For, if ye forgive men their
trespasses your heavenly Father
will also forgive you;

15 But if ye forgive not men their
trespasses neither will your Father
forgive your trespasses.

16 Moreover, when ye fast be not
as the hypocrites, of a sad counte-
nance, for they disfigure their faces
that they may appear unto men to
fast. Verily I say unto you, they have
their reward.

 

17 But thou, when thou fastest,
anoint thy head, and wash thy face;

18 That thou appear not unto
men to fast, but unto thy Father, who
is in secret; and thy Father, who
seeth in secret, shall reward thee
openly.

19 Lay not up for yourselves trea-
sures upon earth, where moth and
rust doth corrupt, and thieves break
through and steal;

20 But lay up for yourselves trea-
sures in heaven, where neither moth
nor rust doth corrupt, and where
thieves do not break through nor
steal.

21 For where your treasure is, there
will your heart be also.

22 The light of the body is the eye;
if, therefore, thine eye be single,
thy whole body shall be full of
light.

23 But if thine eye be evil, thy
whole body shall be full of dark-
ness. If, therefore, the light that is in
thee be darkness, how great is that
darkness!

24 No man can serve two masters;
for either he will hate the one and
love the other, or else he will hold
to the one and despise the other.
Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.

25 And now it came to pass that
when Jesus had spoken these words
he looked upon the twelve whom
he had chosen, and said unto them:
Remember the words which I have
spoken. For behold, ye are they
whom I have chosen to minister
unto this people. Therefore I say
unto you, take no thought for your
life, what ye shall eat, or what ye
