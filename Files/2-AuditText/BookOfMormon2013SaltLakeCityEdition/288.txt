they are raised to dwell at the right
hand of God, in a state of never-
ending happiness.

13 And thus we see how great
the inequality of man is because
of sin and transgression, and the
power of the devil, which comes
by the cunning plans which he
hath devised to ensnare the hearts
of men.

14 And thus we see the great call
of diligence of men to labor in the
vineyards of the Lord; and thus we
see the great reason of sorrow, and
also of rejoicing.sorrow because
of death and destruction among
men, and joy because of the light
of Christ unto life.

CHAPTER 29

Alma desires to cry repentance with an-
gelic zeal.The Lord grants teachers for
all nations.Alma glories in the Lordâ€™s
work and in the success of Ammon and
his brethren. About 76 B.C.

O THAT I were an angel, and could
have the wish of mine heart, that 1
might go forth and speak with the
trump of God, with a voice to shake
the earth, and cry repentance unto
every people!

2 Yea,  would declare unto every
soul, as with the voice of thunder,
repentance and the plan of redemp-
tion, that they should repent and
come unto our God, that there
might not be more sorrow upon all
the face of the earth.

3 But behold, Iam a man, and do
sin in my wish; for I ought to be
content with the things which the
Lord hath allotted unto me.

41 ought not to harrow up in my
desires the firm decree of a just God,

 

for I know that he granteth unto men
according to their desire, whether
it be unto death or unto life; yea,
I know that he allotteth unto men,
yea, decreeth unto them decrees
which are unalterable, according to
their wills, whether they be unto
salvation or unto destruction.

5 Yea, and I know that good and
evil have come before all men; he
that knoweth not good from evil is
blameless; but he that knoweth
good and evil, to him it is given ac-
cording to his desires, whether he
desireth good or evil, life or death,
joy or remorse of conscience.

6 Now, seeing that I know these
things, why should I desire more
than to perform the work to which
I have been called?

7 Why should I desire that I were
an angel, that I could speak unto
all the ends of the earth?

8 For behold, the Lord doth grant
unto all nations, of their own na-
tion and tongue, to teach his word,
yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth
fit that they should have; therefore
we see that the Lord doth counsel
in wisdom, according to that which
is just and true.

9 [know that which the Lord hath
commanded me, and I glory in it.
I do not glory of myself, but I
glory in that which the Lord hath
commanded me; yea, and this is
my glory, that perhaps I may be an
instrument in the hands of God to
bring some soul to repentance; and
this is my joy.

10 And behold, when I see many
of my brethren truly penitent, and
coming to the Lord their God, then
is my soul filled with joy; then dol
remember what the Lord has done
