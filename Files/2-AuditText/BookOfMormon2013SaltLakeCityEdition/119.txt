got a Bible, and there cannot be
any more Bible.

4 But thus saith the Lord God: O
fools, they shall have a Bible; and
it shall proceed forth from the Jews,
mine ancient covenant people. And
what thank they the Jews for the
Bible which they receive from them?
Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do
they remember the travails, and the
labors, and the pains of the Jews, and
their diligence unto me, in bringing
forth salvation unto the Gentiles?

5 Oye Gentiles, have ye remembered
the Jews, mine ancient covenant
people? Nay; but ye have cursed
them, and have hated them, and
have not sought to recover them. But
behold, I will return all these things
upon your own heads; for I the Lord
have not forgotten my people.

6 Thou fool, that shall say: A Bible,
we have got a Bible, and we need
no more Bible. Have ye obtained
a Bible save it were by the Jews?

7 Know ye not that there are more
nations than one? Know ye not
that I, the Lord your God, have cre-
ated all men, and that I remember
those who are upon the isles of the
sea; and that I rule in the heavens
above and in the earth beneath;
and I bring forth my word unto the
children of men, yea, even upon all
the nations of the earth?

8 Wherefore murmur ye, because
that ye shall receive more of my
word? Know ye not that the testi-

 

mony of two nations is a witness
unto you that  am God, that I re-
member one nation like unto an-
other? Wherefore, I speak the same
words unto one nation like unto
another. And when the two nations
shall run together the testimony of
the two nations shall run together
also.

9 And I do this that I may prove
unto many that lam the same yes-
terday, today, and forever; and that
I speak forth my words according
to mine own pleasure. And be-
cause that I have spoken one word
ye need not suppose that I cannot
speak another; for my work is not
yet finished; neither shall it be until
the end of man, neither from that
time henceforth and forever.

10 Wherefore, because that ye have
a Bible ye need not suppose that
it contains all my words; neither
â€™need ye suppose that I have not
caused more to be written.

11 For I command 2all men, both
in the east and in the west, and in
the north, and in the south, and
in the islands of the sea, that they
shall write the words which I speak
unto them; for out of the books
which shall be written I will judge
the world, every man according to
their works, according to that which
is written.

12 For behold, I shall speak unto
the Jews and they shall write
it; and I shall also speak unto the
