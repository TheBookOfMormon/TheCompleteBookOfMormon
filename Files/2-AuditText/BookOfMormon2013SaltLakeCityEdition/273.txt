Behold, this is the thing which doth
trouble me.

6 And also, what is this that Am-
mon said.If ye will repent ye shall
be saved, and if ye will not repent,
ye shall be cast off at the last day?

7 And Aaron answered him and
said unto him: Believest thou that
there is a God? And the king said: I
know that the Amalekites say that
there is a God, and I have granted
unto them that they should build
sanctuaries, that they may assem-
ble themselves together to worship
him. And if now thou sayest there
is a God, behold I will believe.

8 And now when Aaron heard this,
his heart began to rejoice, and he
said: Behold, assuredly as thou liv-
est, O king, there is a God.

9 And the king said: Is God that
Great Spirit that brought our
fathers out of the land of Jerusalem?

10 And Aaron said unto him: Yea,
he is that Great Spirit, and he cre-
ated all things both in heaven and
in earth. Believest thou this?

11 And he said: Yea, I believe that
the Great Spirit created all things,
and I desire that ye should tell me
concerning all these things, and I
will believe thy words.

12 And it came to pass that when
Aaron saw that the king would
believe his words, he began from
the creation of Adam, reading the
scriptures unto the king.how God
â€™created man after his own image,
and that God gave him command-
ments, and that because of trans-

13 And Aaron did expound unto

which was prepared from the foun-

for all whosoever would believe on.
his name.

14 And since man had fallen he
could not merit anything of him-
self; but the sufferings and death
of Christ atone for their sins,
through faith and repentance, and
so forth; and that he breaketh the
bands of death, that the grave shall
have no victory, and that the sting
of death should be swallowed up
in the hopes of glory; and Aaron
did expound all these things unto
the king.

15 And it came to pass that after
Aaron had expounded these things
unto him, the king said: What shall
Ido that I may have this eternal life
of which thou hast spoken? Yea,
what shall I do that I may be born
of God, having this wicked spirit
rooted out of my breast, and receive
his Spirit, that I may be filled with
joy, that I may not be cast off at the
last day? Behold, said he, I will give
up all that I possess, yea, I will for-
sake my kingdom, that I may receive

16 But Aaron said unto him: If
thou desirest this thing, if thou wilt
bow down before God, yea, if thou
wilt repent of all thy sins, and will
bow down before God, and call on
his name in faith, believing that ye
