13 Enter ye in at the strait gate;
for wide is the gate, and broad is
the way, which leadeth to destruc-
tion, and many there be who go in
thereat;

14 Because strait is the gate, and
’narrow is the way, which leadeth
unto life, and few there be that
find it.

15 Beware of false prophets, who
come to you in sheep’s clothing, but
inwardly they are ravening wolves.

16 Ye shall know them by their
fruits. Do men gather grapes of
thorns, or figs of thistles?

17 Even so every good tree bring-
eth forth good fruit; but a corrupt
tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

18 A good tree cannot bring forth
evil fruit, neither a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit.

19 Every tree that bringeth not
forth good fruit is hewn down, and
cast into the fire.

20 Wherefore, by their fruits ye
shall know them.

21 Not every one that saith unto
me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
the kingdom of heaven; but he that
doeth the will of my Father who is
in heaven.

22 Many will say to me in that day:
Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
in thy name, and in thy name have
cast out devils, and in thy name
done many wonderful works?

23 And then will 1 profess unto
them: I never knew you; depart
from me, ye that work iniquity.

24 Therefore, whoso heareth these
sayings of mine and doeth them,

 

I will liken him unto a wise man,
who built his house upon a rock.

25 And the rain descended, and
the floods came, and the winds blew,
and beat upon that house; and it
fell not, for it was founded upon
a rock.

26 And every one that heareth
these sayings of mine and doeth
them not shall be likened unto a
foolish man, who built his house
upon the sand.

27 And the rain descended, and
the floods came, and the winds
blew, and beat upon that house; and
it fell, and great was the fall of it.

CHAPTER 15

Jesus announces that the law of Moses
is fulfilled in Him.The Nephites are
the other sheep of whom He spoke in
Jerusalem.Because of iniquity, the
Lord’s people in Jerusalem do not know
of the scattered sheep of Israel. About
A.D. 34.

AND now it came to pass that when
Jesus had ended these sayings he
cast his eyes round about on the
multitude, and said unto them:
Behold, ye have heard the things
which I taught before I ascended
to my Father; therefore, whoso re-
membereth these sayings of mine
and doeth them, him will I raise
up at the last day.

2 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had said these words he per-
ceived that there were some among
them who marveled, and wondered
what he would concerning the law
