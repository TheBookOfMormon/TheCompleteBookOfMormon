again, saying: Thus shall be the de-
struction of all nations, kindreds,
tongues, and people, that shall
fight against the twelve apostles
of the Lamb.

CHAPTER 12

Nephi sees in vision the land of promise;
the righteousness, iniquity, and down-
fall of its inhabitants; the coming of
the Lamb of God among them; how the
Twelve Disciples and the Twelve Apos-
tles will judge Israel; and the loathsome
and filthy state of those who dwindle
in unbelief. About 600-592 B.c.

AND it came to pass that the angel
said unto me: Look, and behold
thy seed, and also the seed of thy
brethren. And I looked and beheld
the land of promise; and I beheld
multitudes of people, yea, even as
it were in number as many as the
sand of the sea.

2 And it came to pass that I beheld
multitudes gathered together to
battle, one against the other; and I
beheld wars, and rumors of wars,
and great slaughters with the sword
among my people.

3 And it came to pass that I be-
held many generations pass away,
after the manner of wars and con-
tentions in the land; and I beheld
many cities, yea, even that I did not
number them.

4 And it came to pass that I saw
a mist of darkness on the face
of the land of promise; and I saw
lightnings, and I heard thunderings,
and earthquakes, and all manner of
tumultuous noises; and I saw the
earth and the rocks, that they rent;
and Isaw mountains tumbling into

 

pieces; and I saw the plains of the
earth, that they were broken up;
and Isaw many cities that they were
4sunk; and 1 saw many that they
were burned with fire; and I saw
many that did tumble to the earth,
because of the quaking thereof.

5 And it came to pass after I saw
these things, I saw the vapor of
darkness, that it passed from off
the face of the earth; and behold, I
saw multitudes who had not fallen
because of the great and terrible
judgments of the Lord.

6 And I saw the heavens open, and
the Lamb of God descending out
of heaven; and he came down and
showed himself unto them.

7 And  also saw and bear record
that the Holy Ghost fell upon twelve
others; and they were ordained of
God, and chosen.

8 And the angel spake unto me,
saying: Behold the twelve disci-
ples of the Lamb, who are chosen
to minister unto thy seed.

9 And he said unto me: Thou
rememberest the twelve apostles
of the Lamb? Behold they are they
who shall judge the twelve tribes
of Israel; wherefore, the twelve
ministers of thy seed shall be judged
of them; for ye are of the house of
Israel.

10 And these twelve ministers
whom thou beholdest shall judge
thy seed. And, behold, they are
righteous forever; for because of
their faith in the Lamb of God their
â€™earments are made white in his
blood.

11 And the angel said unto me:
Look! And I looked, and beheld
three generations pass away in
