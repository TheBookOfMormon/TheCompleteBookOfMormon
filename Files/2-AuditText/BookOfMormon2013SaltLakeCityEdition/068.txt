children; yea, even the family of
all the earth.

21 And the days of the children
of men were prolonged, accord-
ing to the will of God, that they
might repent while in the flesh;
wherefore, their state became a
state of probation, and their time
was lengthened, according to the
commandments which the Lord God
gave unto the children of men. For
he gave commandment that all men
must repent; for he showed unto all
men that they were lost, because of
the transgression of their parents.

22 And now, behold, if Adam
had not transgressed he would not
have fallen, but he would have
remained in the garden of Eden.
And all things which were created
must have remained in the same
state in which they were after they
were created; and they must have
remained forever, and had no end.

23 And they would have had no
children; wherefore they would
have remained in a state of inno-
cence, having no joy, for they knew
no misery; doing no good, for they
knew no sin.

24 But behold, all things have
been done in the wisdom of him
who knoweth all things.

25 Adam fell that men might
be; and men are, that they might
have joy.

26 And the Messiah cometh in
the fulness of time, that he may

 

redeem the children of men from
the fall. And because that they are
redeemed from the fall they have
become free forever, knowing good
from evil; to act for themselves
and not to be acted upon, save it
be by the punishment of the law
at the great and last day, according
to the commandments which God
hath given.

27 Wherefore, men are free ac-
cording to the flesh; and all things
are given them which are expedi-
ent unto man. And they are free to
choose liberty and eternal life,
through the great Mediator of all
men, or to choose captivity and
death, according to the captivity and
power of the devil; for he seeketh
that all men might be miserable
like unto himself.

28 And now, my sons, I would
that ye should look to the great
Mediator, and hearken unto his
great commandments; and be faith-
ful unto his words, and choose eter-
nal life, according to the will of his
Holy Spirit;

29 And not choose eternal death,
according to the will of the flesh
and the evil which is therein, which
giveth the spirit of the devil power
to captivate, to bring you down to
hell, that he may reign over you in
his own kingdom.

30 I have spoken these few words
unto you all, my sons, in the last
days of my probation; and I have
