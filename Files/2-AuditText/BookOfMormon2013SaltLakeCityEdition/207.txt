unto the end a place at my right
hand.

24 For behold, in my name are they
called; and if they know me they
shall come forth, and shall have a
place eternally at my right hand.

25 And it shall come to pass that
when the second trump shall sound
then shall they that never knew
me come forth and shall stand be-
fore me.

26 And then shall they know that
lam the Lord their God, that lam
their Redeemer; but they would not
be redeemed.

27 And then I will confess unto
them that I never knew them; and
they shall depart into everlasting
fire prepared for the devil and his
angels.

28 Therefore I say unto you, that
he that will not hear my voice, the
same shall ye not receive into my
church, for him I will not receive
at the last day.

29 Therefore I say unto you, Go;
and whosoever transgresseth against
me, him shall ye judge according
to the sins which he has commit-
ted; and if he confess his sins be-
fore thee and me, and /repenteth
in the sincerity of his heart, him
shall ye forgive, and I will forgive
him also.

30 Yea, and as often as my people
’repent will I forgive them their
trespasses against me.

31 And ye shall also forgive one
another your trespasses; for verily
I say unto you, he that forgiveth
not his neighbor’s trespasses when.
he says that he repents, the same

 

hath brought himself under con-
demnation.

32 Now I say unto you, Go; and
whosoever will not repent of his
sins the same shall not be numbered
among my people; and this shall be
observed from this time forward.

33 And it came to pass when Alma
had heard these words he wrote
them down that he might have
them, and that he might judge the
people of that church according to
the commandments of God.

34 And it came to pass that Alma
went and judged those that had
been taken in iniquity, according
to the word of the Lord.

35 And whosoever repented of
their sins and did confess them,
them he did number among the
people of the church;

36 And those that would not con-
fess their sins and repent of their in-
iquity, the same were not numbered
among the people of the church,
and their names were blotted out.

37 And it came to pass that Alma
did regulate all the affairs of the
church; and they began again to
have peace and to prosper exceed-
ingly in the affairs of the church,
walking circumspectly before God,
receiving many, and baptizing many.

38 And now all these things did
Alma and his fellow laborers do
who were over the church, walking
in all diligence, teaching the word
of God in all things, suffering all
manner of afflictions, being per-
secuted by all those who did not
belong to the church of God.

39 And they did admonish their
