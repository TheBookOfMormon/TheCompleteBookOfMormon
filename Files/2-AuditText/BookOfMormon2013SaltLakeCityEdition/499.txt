into that quarter where there never
had man been. And it came to pass
that the Lord did go before them,
and did talk with them as he stood
in a cloud, and gave directions
whither they should travel.

6 And it came to pass that they
did travel in the wilderness, and did
build barges, in which they did
cross many waters, being directed
continually by the hand of the Lord.

7 And the Lord would not suffer
that they should stop beyond the
sea in the wilderness, but he would
that they should come forth even
unto the land of promise, which
was choice above all other lands,
which the Lord God had preserved
for a righteous people.

8 And he had sworn in his wrath
unto the brother of Jared, that
whoso should possess this land of
promise, from that time henceforth
and forever, should serve him, the
true and only God, or they should
be swept off when the fulness of
his wrath should come upon them.

9 And now, we can behold the de-
crees of God concerning this land,
that it is a land of promise; and
whatsoever nation shall possess it
shall serve God, or they shall be
swept off when the fulness of his
wrath shall come upon them. And
the fulness of his wrath cometh
upon them when they are ripened
in iniquity.

10 For behold, this is a land which
is choice above all other lands;
wherefore he that doth possess it
shall serve God or shall be swept
off; for it is the everlasting decree of
God. And it is not until the fulness
of iniquity among the children of
the land, that they are swept off.

 

11 And this cometh unto you, O
ye Gentiles, that ye may know the
decrees of God.that ye may repent,
and not continue in your iniqui-
ties until the fulness come, that
ye may not bring down the fulness
of the wrath of God upon you as
the inhabitants of the land have
hitherto done.

12 Behold, this is a choice land,
and whatsoever nation shall pos-
sess it shall be free from bondage,
and from captivity, and from all
other nations under heaven, if they
will but serve the God of the land,
who is Jesus Christ, who hath been
manifested by the things which we
have written.

13 And now I proceed with my
record; for behold, it came to pass
that the Lord did bring Jared and
his brethren forth even to that great
sea which divideth the lands. And
as they came to the sea they pitched
their tents; and they called the
name of the place Moriancumer;
and they dwelt in tents, and dwelt
in tents upon the seashore for the
space of four years.

14 And it came to pass at the end
of four years that the Lord came
again unto the brother of Jared,
and stood in a cloud and talked
with him. And for the space of three
hours did the Lord talk with the
brother of Jared, and chastened
him because he remembered not
to call upon the name of the Lord.

15 And the brother of Jared re-
pented of the evil which he had done,
and did call upon the name of the
Lord for his brethren who were with
him. And the Lord said unto him: 1
will forgive thee and thy brethren
of their sins; but thou shalt not sin
