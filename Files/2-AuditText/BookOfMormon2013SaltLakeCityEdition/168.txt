may seal you his, that you may be
brought to heaven, that ye may have
everlasting salvation and eternal
life, through the wisdom, and power,
and justice, and mercy of him who
4created all things, in heaven and
in earth, who is God above all.
Amen.

CHAPTER 6

King Benjamin records the names of
the people and appoints priests to teach
them.Mosiah reigns as a righteous
king. About 124-121 B.c.

AND now, king Benjamin thought
it was expedient, after having fin-
ished speaking to the people, that
he should take the names of all
those who had entered into a cov-
enant with God to keep his com-
mandments.

2 And it came to pass that there
was not one soul, except it were little
children, but who had entered into
the covenant and had taken upon
them the name of Christ.

3 And again, it came to pass that
when king Benjamin had made an
end of all these things, and had
consecrated his son Mosiah to be
a ruler and a king over his people,
and had given him all the charges
concerning the kingdom, and also
had appointed priests to teach
the people, that thereby they might
hear and know the commandments
of God, and to stir them up in re-
membrance of the oath which they
had made, he dismissed the multi-
tude, and they returned, every one,
according to their families, to their
own houses.

4 And Mosiah began to reign in
his father’s stead. And he began to
reign in the thirtieth year of his
age, making in the whole, about
four hundred and seventy-six

 

years from the time that Lehi left
Jerusalem.

5 And king Benjamin lived three
years and he died.

6 And it came to pass that king
Mosiah did walk in the ways of the
Lord, and did observe his judgments
and his statutes, and did keep his
commandments in all things what-
soever he commanded him.

7 And king Mosiah did cause his
people that they should till the
earth. And he also, himself, did till
the earth, that thereby he might not
become burdensome to his people,
that he might do according to that
which his father had done in all
things. And there was no conten-
tion among all his people for the
space of three years.

CHAPTER 7

Ammon finds the land of Lehi-Nephi,
where Limhi is king.Limhi’s people are
in bondage to the Lamanites.Limhi
recounts their history.A prophet (Abin-
adi) had testified that Christ is the God
and Father of all things.Those who
sow filthiness reap the whirlwind, and
those who put their trust in the Lord
will be delivered. About 121 B.c.

AND now, it came to pass that af-
ter king Mosiah had had continual
peace for the space of three years,
he was desirous to know concerning
the people who went up to dwell
in the land of Lehi-Nephi, or in
the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his peo-
ple had heard nothing from them
from the time they left the land of
Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied
him with their teasings.

2 And it came to pass that king
Mosiah granted that sixteen of their
strong men might go up to the land
of Lehi-Nephi, to inquire concern-
ing their brethren.
