city, and they called the name of
the city Moroni; and it was by the
east sea; and it was on the south by
the line of the possessions of the
Lamanites.

14 And they also began a foun-
dation for a city between the city
of Moroni and the city of Aaron,
joining the borders of Aaron and
Moroni; and they called the name
of the city, or the land, Nephihah.

15 And they also began in that
same year to build many cities on
the north, one ina particular man-
ner which they called Lehi, which
was in the north by the borders of
the seashore.

16 And thus ended the twentieth
year.

17 And in these prosperous circum-
stances were the people of Nephi in
the commencement of the twenty
and first year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi.

18 And they did prosper exceed-
ingly, and they became exceedingly
rich; yea, and they did multiply and
wax strong in the land.

19 And thus we see how merci-
ful and just are all the dealings of
the Lord, to the fulfilling of all his
words unto the children of men; yea,
we can behold that his words are
verified, even at this time, which
he spake unto Lehi, saying:

20 Blessed art thou and thy chil-
dren; and they shall be blessed,
inasmuch as they shall keep my
commandments they shall pros-
per in the land. But remember, in-
asmuch as they will not keep my
commandments they shall be cut
off from the presence of the Lord.

21 And we see that these prom-
ises have been verified to the peo-
ple of Nephi; for it has been their
quarrelings and their contentions,
yea, their murderings, and their

 

plunderings, their idolatry, their
whoredoms, and their abomina-
tions, which were among them-
selves, which brought upon them
their wars and their destructions.

22 And those who were faithful
in keeping the commandments of
the Lord were delivered at all times,
whilst thousands of their wicked
brethren have been consigned to
bondage, or to perish by the sword,
or to dwindle in unbelief, and min-
gle with the Lamanites.

23 But behold there never was a
happier time among the people of
Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than
in the days of Moroni, yea, even at
this time, in the twenty and first
year of the reign of the judges.

24 And it came to pass that the
twenty and second year of the reign
of the judges also ended in peace;
yea, and also the twenty and third
year.

25 And it came to pass that in
the commencement of the twenty
and fourth year of the reign of the
judges, there would also have been
peace among the people of Nephi
had it not been for a contention
which took place among them con-
cerning the land of Lehi, and the
land of Morianton, which joined
upon the borders of Lehi; both of
which were on the borders by the
seashore.

26 For behold, the people who
possessed the land of Morianton
did claim a part of the land of Lehi;
therefore there began to be a warm
contention between them, inso-
much that the people of Morianton
took up arms against their breth-
ren, and they were determined by
the sword to slay them.

27 But behold, the people who pos-
sessed the land of Lehi fled to the
camp of Moroni, and appealed unto
