fiery flying serpents among them;
and after they were bitten he pre-
pared a way that they might be
healed; and the labor which they
had to perform was to look; and
because of the simpleness of the
way, or the easiness of it, there were
many who perished.

42 And they did harden their hearts
from time to time, and they did re-
vile against Moses, and also against
God; nevertheless, ye know that
they were led forth by his matchless
power into the land of promise.

43 And now, after all these things,
the time has come that they have
become wicked, yea, nearly unto
ripeness; and I know not but they are
at this day about to be destroyed;
for I know that the day must surely
come that they must be destroyed,
save a few only, who shall be led
away into captivity.

44 Wherefore, the Lord com-
manded my father that he should
depart into the wilderness; and the
Jews also sought to take away his
life; yea, and ye also have sought
to take away his life; wherefore, ye
are murderers in your hearts and
ye are like unto them.

45 Ye are swift to do iniquity but
slow to remember the Lord your
God. Ye have seen an angel, and he
spake unto you; yea, ye have heard
his voice from time to time; and he
hath spoken unto you ina still small
voice, but ye were past feeling, that
ye could not feel his words; where-
fore, he has spoken unto you like
unto the voice of thunder, which
did cause the earth to shake as if
it were to divide asunder.

46 And ye also know that by the

 

power of his almighty word he can
cause the earth that it shall pass
away; yea, and ye know that by his
word he can cause the rough places to
be made smooth, and smooth places
shall be broken up. O, then, why is it,
that ye can be so hard in your hearts?

47 Behold, my soul is rent with
anguish because of you, and my
heart is pained; I fear lest ye shall
be cast off forever. Behold, lam full
of the Spirit of God, insomuch that
my frame has no strength.

48 And now it came to pass that
when  had spoken these words they
were angry with me, and were desir-
ous to throw me into the depths of
the sea; and as they came forth to lay
their hands upon me I spake unto
them, saying: In the name of the
Almighty God, [command you that
ye touch me not, for lam filled with
the power of God, even unto the
consuming of my flesh; and whoso
shall lay his hands upon me shall
ewither even as a dried reed; and he
shall be as naught before the power
of God, for God shall smite him.

49 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, said unto them that they
should murmur no more against
their father; neither should they
withhold their labor from me, for
God had commanded me that I
should build a ship.

50 And I said unto them: If God
had commanded me to do all things
I could do them. If he should com-
mand me that I should say unto
this water, be thou earth, it should
be earth; and if I should say it, it
would be done.

51 And now, if the Lord has such
great power, and has wrought so
