10 And they did all, both they who
had been healed and they who were
whole, bow down at his feet, and
did worship him; and as many as
could come for the multitude did
kiss his feet, insomuch that they
did bathe his feet with their tears.

11 And it came to pass that he
commanded that their little chil-
dren should be brought.

12 So they brought their little
children and set them down upon
the ground round about him, and
Jesus stood in the midst; and the
multitude gave way till they had
all been brought unto him.

13 And it came to pass that when
they had all been brought, and Jesus
stood in the midst, he commanded
the multitude that they should
kneel down upon the ground.

14 And it came to pass that when.
they had knelt upon the ground,
Jesus groaned within himself, and
said: Father, I am troubled because
of the wickedness of the people of
the house of Israel.

15 And when he had said these
words, he himself also knelt upon
the earth; and behold he prayed
unto the Father, and the things
which he prayed cannot be written,
and the multitude did bear record
who heard him.

16 And after this manner do they
bear record: The eye hath never
seen, neither hath the ear heard,
before, so great and marvelous
things as we saw and heard Jesus
speak unto the Father;

17 And no tongue can speak, nei-
ther can there be written by any
man, neither can the hearts of men
conceive so great and marvelous
things as we both saw and heard

 

Jesus speak; and no one can conceive
of the joy which filled our souls at
the time we heard him pray for us
unto the Father.

18 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had made an end of praying
unto the Father, he arose; but so
great was the joy of the multitude
that they were overcome.

19 And it came to pass that Jesus
spake unto them, and bade them
arise.

20 And they arose from the earth,
and he said unto them: Blessed are
ye because of your faith. And now
behold, my joy is full.

21 And when he had said these
words, he wept, and the multitude
bare record of it, and he took their
little children, one by one, and
blessed them, and prayed unto the
Father for them.

22 And when he had done this he
wept again;

23 And he spake unto the multi-
tude, and said unto them: Behold
your little ones.

24 And as they looked to behold
they cast their eyes towards heaven,
and they saw the heavens open, and
they saw angels descending out of
heaven as it were in the midst of fire;
and they came down and encircled
those little ones about, and they
were encircled about with fire; and
the angels did minister unto them.

25 And the multitude did see and
hear and bear record; and they
know that their record is true for
they all of them did see and hear,
every man for himself; and they
were in number about two thou-
sand and five hundred souls; and
they did consist of men, women,
and children.
