possible, that we might get them
together in one body.

8 But behold, the land was filled
with robbers and with Lamanites;
and notwithstanding the great de-
struction which hung over my peo-
ple, they did not repent of their evil
doings; therefore there was blood
and carnage spread throughout all
the face of the land, both on the
part of the Nephites and also on
the part of the Lamanites; and it was
one complete revolution through-
out all the face of the land.

9 And now, the Lamanites had a
king, and his name was Aaron; and
he came against us with an army of
forty and four thousand. And be-
hold, I withstood him with forty and
two thousand. And it came to pass
that I beat him with my army that
he fled before me. And behold, all
this was done, and three hundred
and thirty years had passed away.

10 And it came to pass that the
Nephites began to repent of their
iniquity, and began to cry even as
had been prophesied by Samuel the
prophet; for behold no man could
keep that which was his own, for
the thieves, and the robbers, and
the murderers, and the magic art,
and the witchcraft which was in
the land.

11 Thus there began to be amourn-
ing and a lamentation in all the
land because of these things, and
more especially among the people
of Nephi.

12 And it came to pass that when I,
Mormon, saw their lamentation and
their mourning and their sorrow
before the Lord, my heart did begin
to rejoice within me, knowing the
mercies and the long-suffering of

 

the Lord, therefore supposing that
he would be merciful unto them
that they would again become a
righteous people.

13 But behold this my joy was vain,
for their sorrowing was not unto
repentance, because of the goodness
of God; but it was rather the sor-
rowing of the damned, because the
Lord would not always suffer them
to take happiness in sin.

14 And they did not come unto
Jesus with broken hearts and con-
trite spirits, but they did curse God,
and wish to die. Nevertheless they
would struggle with the sword for
their lives.

15 And it came to pass that my
sorrow did return unto me again,
and I saw that the day of grace
was passed with them, both tem-
porally and spiritually; for 1 saw
thousands of them hewn down in
open rebellion against their God,
and heaped up as dung upon the
face of the land. And thus three
hundred and forty and four years
had passed away.

16 And it came to pass that in the
three hundred and forty and fifth
year the Nephites did begin to flee
before the Lamanites; and they were
pursued until they came even to the
land of Jashon, before it was pos-
sible to stop them in their retreat.

17 And now, the city of Jashon
was near the land where Amma-
ron had deposited the records unto
the Lord, that they might not be
destroyed. And behold I had gone
according to the word of Ammaron,
and taken the plates of Nephi, and
did make a record according to the
words of Ammaron.

18 And upon the plates of Nephil
