Behold, my sons and my daughters,
who are the sons and the daughters
of my second son; behold I leave
unto you the same blessing which
I left unto the sons and daughters
of Laman; wherefore, thou shalt not
utterly be destroyed; but in the end
thy seed shall be blessed.

10 And it came to pass that when
my father had made an end of speak-
ing unto them, behold, he spake
unto the sons of Ishmael, yea, and
even all his household.

11 And after he had made an end
of speaking unto them, he spake
unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou,
and thy seed; for thou shalt in-
herit the land like unto thy brother
Nephi. And thy seed shall be num-
bered with his seed; and thou shalt
be even like unto thy brother, and
thy seed like unto his seed; and
thou shalt be blessed in all thy
days.

12 And it came to pass after my
father, Lehi, had spoken unto all
his household, according to the
feelings of his heart and the Spirit
of the Lord which was in him, he
waxed old. And it came to pass that
he died, and was buried.

13 And it came to pass that not
many days after his death, Laman
and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael
were angry with me because of the
admonitions of the Lord.

14 For I, Nephi, was constrained to
speak unto them, according to his
word; for  had spoken many things
unto them, and also my father, be-
fore his death; many of which say-
ings are written upon mine other

 

plates; for a more history part are
written upon mine other plates.

15 And upon these I write the
things of my soul, and many of
the scriptures which are engraven
upon the plates of brass. For my
soul delighteth in the scriptures,
and my heart pondereth them, and
writeth them for the learning and
the profit of my children.

16 Behold, my soul delighteth
in the things of the Lord; and my
heart pondereth continually upon
the things which I have seen and
heard.

17 Nevertheless, notwithstanding
the great goodness of the Lord, in
showing me his great and marvel-
ous works, my heart exclaimeth:
O wretched man that I am! Yea,
my heart sorroweth because of my
flesh; my soul grieveth because of
mine iniquities.

181 am encompassed about, be-
cause of the temptations and the
sins which do so easily beset me.

19 And when I desire to rejoice,
my heart groaneth because of my
sins; nevertheless, I know in whom
I have trusted.

20 My God hath been my support;
he hath led me through mine af-
flictions in the wilderness; and he
hath preserved me upon the waters
of the great deep.

21 He hath filled me with his
love, even unto the consuming
of my flesh.

22 He hath confounded mine en-
emies, unto the causing of them to
quake before me.

23 Behold, he hath heard my cry by
