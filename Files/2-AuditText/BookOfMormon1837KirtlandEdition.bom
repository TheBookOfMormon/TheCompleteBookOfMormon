Â§c
.
This
is
according
io
the
account
of
Nephi
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
I
Nephi
wrote
this
record
.
I
,
Neput
,
having
been
born
of
goodly
parents
,
therefore
I
was
taught
somewhat
in
all
the
learning
of
my
father
;
and
have
seen
many
afflictions
in
the
course
of
my
days
.
nevertheless
,
having
been
highly
favored
of
the
Lord
in
all
my
days
;
yea
,
having
had
a
great
knowledge
of
the
goodness
and
the
mysteries
of
God
,
therefore
I
make
a
record
of
my
proceedings
in
my
days
;
yea
,
1
make
a
record
in
the
language
of
my
father
,
which
consists
of
the
learning
of
the
Jews
and
the
language
of
the
Egyptians
.
And
I
know
that
the
record
which
I
make
is
true
;
and
I
make
it
with
mine
own
hand
;
and
I
make
it
according
to
my
knowledge
.
For
it
came
to
.
pass
,
in
the
commencement
of
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of
Zedekiah
,
king
of
Judah
,
(
my
father
Lehi
having
dwelt
.
at
Jerusalem
in
all
his
days
;)
andin'that
same
year
there
came
many
prophets
,
prophesying
unto
the
people
,
that
they
must
repent
,
or
the
great
city
Jerusalem
must
be
destroyed
.
[File:006]
Wherefore
it
came
to
pass
,
that
my
father
Lehi
,
as
he
went
forth
,
prayed
unto
the
Lord
,
yea
,
even
with
all
his
heart
,
in
behalf
of
his
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
,
as
he
prayed
unto
the
Lord
,
there
came
a
pillar
of
fire
and
dwelt
upona
rock
before
him
;
and
he
saw
and
heard
much
;
and
because
of
the
things
which
he
saw
and
heard
,
he
did
quake
and
tremble
exceedingly
.
And
it
eame
to
pass
that
he
returned
to
his
own
house
at
Jerusalem
;
and
he
cast
himself
upon
his
bed
,
being
overcome
with
the
spirit
and
the
things
which
he
had
seen
;
and
being
thus
overcome
with
the
spirit
,
he
was
carried
away
in
a
vision
,
even
that
he
saw
the
heavens
open
,
and
he
thought
he
saw
God
sitting
upon
his
throne
,
surrounded
with
numberless
concourses
a
angels
in
the
attitude
of
singing
and
praising
their
od
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
saw
one
descending
out
of
the
midst
of
heaven
,
and
he
beheld
that
his
lustre
was
above
that
of
the
sun
at
noon
-
day
;
and
he
also
saw
twelve
others
following
him
,
and
their
brightness
did
exeeed
that
of
the
stars
in
the
firmament
;
and
they
came
down
and
went
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
;
and
the
first
came
and
stood
before
my
father
,
and
gave
unto
him
a
beok
,
and
bade
him
that
he
should
read
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
he
read
,
he
was
filled
with
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
,
and
he
read
,
saying
,
Wo
,
wo
unto
Jerusalem
!
for
J
have
seen
thine
abominations
;
yea
,
and
many
things
did
my
father
read
concerning
Jerusalem
.
that
it
should
be
destroyed
,
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
,
many
should
perish
by
the
sword
,
and
many
should
be
:
carried
away
captive
into
Babylon
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
had
read
and
saw
many
great
and
marvellous
things
,
he
did
exclaim
many
things
unto
the
Lord
;
such
as
,
great
and
marvellous
are
thy
works
,
O
Lord
God
Almighty
!
Thy
throne
is
high
in
the
heavens
,
and
thy
power
,
and
goodness
,
and
mercy
are
overall
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
;
and
because
thou
art
merciful
,
thou
wilt
not
suffer
those
who
come
unto
thee
that
they
shall
perish
!
And
after
this
manner
was
the
language
of
my
father
in
the
praising
of
his
God
;
for
.
his
soul
did
rejoice
,
and
his
whole
heart
was
filled
,
because
of
the
things
which
he
had
seen
;
yea
,
which
the
Lord
:
had
shewn
unto
him
.
And
now
I
,
Nephi
,
do
not
make
.
a
full
account
of
the
things
.
which
my
father'
hath
.
written
,
for
he
[File:007]
hath
written
many
things
which
he
saw
in
visions
and
in
dreams
;
and
he
also
hath
written
many
things
which
he
prophesied
and
spake
unto
his
children
,
of
which
I
shall
not
make
a
full
account
;
but
I
shall
make
an
account
of
my
proceedings
.
in
my
days
.
~Behold
I
make
an
abridgement
of
the
record
of
my
father
,
upon
plates
which
i
have
made
with
mine
own
hands
;
wherefore
,
after
I
have
abridged
the
record
of
my
father
,
then
will
I
make
an
account
of
mine
own
life
.
Therefore
,
I
would
that
ye
should
know
,
that
after
the
Lord
had
shewn
so
many
marvellous
things
unto
my
father
Lehi
,
yea
,
concerning
the
destruction
of
Jerusalem
,
behold
he
went
forth
among
the
people
,
and
began
to
prophesy
and
to
declare
unto
them
concerning
the
things
which
he
had
both
seen
and
heard
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Jews
did
mock
him
because
of
the
things
which
he
testified
of
them
;
for
he
truly
testified
of
their
wickednes
and
their
abominations
;
and
he
testified
that
the
things
which
he
saw
and
heard
,
and
also
the
things
which
he
read
in
the
book
,
manifested
plainly
of
the
coming
of
a
:
Messiah
,
and
also
the
redemption
of
the
world
.
And
when
the
Jews
heard
these
things
,
they
were
angry
with
him
;
yea
,
even
as
with
the
prophets
of
old
,
whom
they
had
cast
out
and
stoned
and
slain
;
and
they
also
sought
his
life
,
that
they
might
take
it
away
.
But
behold
,
I
,
Nephi
,
will
shew
unto
you
that
the
.
tender
mercies
of
the
Lord
are
over
all
those
whom
he
hath
chosen
,
because
of
their
faith
,
to
make
them
mighty
even
unto
the
power
of
deliverance
.
For
behold
it
-
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
spake
unto
my
father
,
yea
,
even
in
a
dream
,
and
said
unto
him
,
blessed
art
thou
Lehi
,
because
of
the
things
which
thou
hast
done
;
and
because
thou
hast
been
faithful
and
declared
unto
this
people
the
things
which
I
commanded
thee
,
behold
they
seek
to
take
away
thy
life
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
commanded
my
father
,
even
in
a
dream
,
that
he
should
take
his
family
and
depart
into
the
wilderness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
obedient
unto
the
word
of
the
Lord
,
wherefore
he
did
as
the
Lord
commanded
him
.
_
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
departed
into
the
wilderness
.
And
he
left
his
house
,
and
the
land
of
his
-
in
,
heritance
,
and
his
gold
,
and
his
silver
,
and
his
precious
things
,
and
took
nothing
with
him
save
it
were
his
family
,
and
provisions
,
and
tents
,
and
departed
into
the
wilderness
;
and
he
came
down
by
the
borders
near
[File:008]
the
shore
of
the
Red
Sea
:
and
he
travelled
in
the
wilderness
in
the
borders
which
are
nearer
the
Red
Sea
;
and
he
did
travel
in
the
wilderness
with
his
family
,
which
consisted
of
my
mother
,
Sariah
,
and
my
elder
brothers
,
who
were
Laman
,
Lemuel
and
Sam
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
travelled
three
days
in
the
wildernass
,
he
pitched
his
tent
in
a
valley
by
the
side
ofa
river
of
water
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
built
an
altar
of
stones
,
and
made
an
offering
unto
the
Lord
,
and
gave
thanks
nnto
the
Lod
our
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
called
the
name
of
the
river
Laman
,
and
it
emptied
into
the
Red
Sea
;
and
the
valley
was
in
the
borders
near
the
mouth
thereof
.
And
when
my
father
saw
that
the
waters
of
the
river
emptied
into
the
fountain
of
the
Red
Sea
,
he
spake
unto
Laman
,
saying
,
O
that
thou
mightest
be
like
unto
this
river
,
continually
running
into
the
fountain
of
all
righteousness
.
And
he
also
spake
unto
Lemuel
:
O
that
thou
mightest
be
like
unto
this
valley
,
firm
,
and
steadfast
,
and
immovable
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
.
Now
this
he
spake
because
of
the
stiffneckedness
of
Laman
and
Lemuel
;
for
behold
they
did
murmur
in
many
things
against
their
father
,
because
he
was
a
visionary
man
,
and
had
led
them
out
of
the
land
ef
Jerusalem
,
to
leave
the
land
of
their
inheritance
,
and
their
gold
,
and
their
silver
,
and
their
precious
things
,
to
perish
in
the
wildesness
.
And
this
they
said
he
had
done
because
of
the
foolish
imaginations
of
his
heart
.
And
thus
Laman
and
Lemuel
,
being
the
eldest
,
did
murmur
against
their
father
.
And
they
did
murmur
because
they
knew
not
the
dealings
of
that
God
who
had
created
them
.
Neither
did
they
believe
that
Jerusalem
,
that
great
city
,
could
be
destroyed
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
..
And
they
were
like
unto
the
Jews
,
who
were
at
Jerusalem
,
who
sought
to
take
away
the
life
of
my
father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
my
father
did
speak
unto
them
in
the
valley
of
Lemuel
,
with
power
,
being
filled
with
the
spirit
,
until
their
frames
did
shake
before
him
.
And
he
did
confound
them
,
that
they
durst
not
utter
against
him
;
wherefore
they
did
as
he
commanded
them
.
And
my
father
dwelt
in
a
tent
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
being
exceeding
young
,
nevertheless
being
large
in
stature
,
and
also
aving
great
desires
to
know
of
the
mysteries
of
God
,
.
wherefore
I
did
cry
unto
the
Lord
;
and
behold
he
did
[File:009]
visit
me
,
and
did
soften
my
heart
that
I
did
believe
all
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
my
father
;
wherefore
I
did
not
rebel
against
him
like
unto
my
brothers
.
And
J
spake
unto
Sam
,
making
known
unto
him
the
things
which
the
Lord
had
manifested
unto
me
by
his
Holy
Spirit
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
believed
in
my
words
;
but
behold
Laman
and
Lemuel
would
not
hearken
unto
my
words
:
And
being
grieved
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
,
I
cried
unto
the
Lord
for
tiem
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
spake
unto
me
,
saying
:
blessed
art
thou
,
Nephi
,
because
of
thy
faith
,
for
thou
hast
sought
me
diligently
,
with
lowliness
of
heart
.
And
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
shall
prosper
,
and
shall
be
led
to
a
land
of
promise
;
yea
,
even
a
land
which
have
prepared
for
you
;
yea
,
a
land
which
is
choice
above
all
other
lands
.
And
inasmuch
as
thy
brethren
shall
rebel
against
thee
,
they
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
Lerd
.
And
inasmuch
as
thou
shalt
keep
my
commandments
,
thou
shalt
be
made
a
ruler
and
a
teacher
over
thy
brethren
.
For
bebold
,
in
that
day
that
they
shall
rebel
against
me
,
[
will
curse
them
even
with
a
sore
curse
,
and
they
shall
have
no
power
over
-
thy
seed
,
except
they
shall
rebel
against
me
also
.
And
if
it
so
be
that
they
rebel
against
me
,
they
shall
be
a
scourge
unto
thy
seed
,
to
stir
them
up
in
the
ways
of
remembrance
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
returned
from
speaking
with
the
Lord
,
to
the
tent
of
my
father
..
And
it
came
to
)
pass
that
he
spake
unto
me
,
saying
:
Behold
I
have
dreamed
a
dream
,
in
the
which
the
Lord
hath
commanded
me
that
thou
and
thy
brethren
shall
return
to
Jerusalem
.:
For
behold
,
Laban
hath
the
record
of
the
Jews
,
and
also
.
a
genealogy
of
thy
forefathers
,
and
they
are
.
engraven
upon
plates
of
brass
.
Wherefore
the
Lord
hath
commanded
me
that
thou
and
thy
brothers
should
go
unto
the
house
of
Laban

And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,:
said
:
unto
my

,
I
will
go
.

things

,
save
he
shall
prepare
a
way
for
them
that
they
may
accomplish
the
thing
which
he
commandeth
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
had
heard
these
words
,
he
was
exceeding
glad
,
for
he
knew
that
I
had
been
blessed
of
the
Lord
.
And
I
,
Nephi
,
and
my
brethren
,
took
our
journey
in
the
wilderness
with
our
tents
,
to
go
up
to
the
laud
of
Jerusalem
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
we
had
come
up
to
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
I
and
my
brethren
did
consult
one
with
another
;
and
we
cast
lots
who
of
us
should
goin
unto
the
house
of
Laban
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
lot
fell
upon
Laman
;
and
Laman
went
in
unto
the
house
of
Laban
,
and
he
talked
with
him
as
he
sat
in
his
house
.
And
he
desired
of
Laban
the
records
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
which
contained
the
genealogy
of
my
father
.
And
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
Laban
was
angry
and
thrust
him
out
from
his
presence
;
and
he
would
not
that
he
should
have
the
records
.
Wherefore
he
said
unto
him
,
behold
thou
art
a
robber
,
and
I
will
slay
thee
.
But
Laman
fled
out
of
his
presence
,
and
told
the
things
which
Laban
had
done
,
unto
us
.
And
we
began
to
be
exceeding
sorrowful
,
and
my
brethren
were
about
to
return
unto
my
father
in
the
wilderness
.
But
behold
I
said
unto
them
,
that
-
as
the
Lord
liveth
,
and
as
we
live
,
we
will
not
go
down
unto
our
father
in
the
wilderness
,
until
we
have
accomplished
the
thing
which
the
Lord
hath
commanded
us
.
Wherefore
let
us
be
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
;
therefore
let
us
go
down
to
the
land
of
our
father's
inheritance
,
for
behold
he
left
gold
and
silver
,
andall
manner
of
riches
.
And
all
this
he
hath
done
,
because
of
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
:
for
he
knowing
that
Jerusalem
must
be
destroyed
,
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
.
For
behold
.
they
have
rejected
the
words
of
the
prophets
.
Wherefore
if
my
father
should
dwell
in
the
land
after
he
hath
been
commanded
to
flee
out
of
the
land
,
behold
he
would
also
perish
.
Wherefore
it
must
needs
be
that
he
flee
out
of
the
land
.
And
behold
it
is
wisdom
in
God
that
we
should
obtain
these
records
,
that
we
may
preserve
unto
our
children
the
es
of
our
fathers
;
and
also
that
we
may
preserve
unto
them
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
all
the
holy
prophets
,
which
have
been
delivered
unto
[File:011]
them
by
the
spirit
and
power
of
God
,
since
the
world
began
,
even
down
unto
this
present
time
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
this
manner
of
lan
uage
did
I
persuade
my
brethren
,
that
shey
might
be
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
went
down
to
the
land
of
our
inheritance
,
and
we
did
gather
together
our
gold
,
and
our
silver
,
and
our
precious
things
.
And
after
we
had
gathered
these
things
together
,
we
went
up
again
unto
the
house
of
Laban
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
went
in
unto
Laban
,
and
desired
him
that
he
would
give
unto
us
the
records
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
for
which
we
would
give
unto
him
our
gold
,
and
our
silver
,
and
all
our
precious
things
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Laban
saw
our
property
,
and
that
it
was
exceeding
great
,
he
did
lust
after
it
,
insomuch
that
he
thrust
us
out
,
and
sent
his
servants
to
slay
us
,
that
he
might
ebtain
our
property
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
flee
before
the
servants
of
Laban
,
and
we
were
obliged
to
leave
behind
our
property
,
and
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
Laban
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
fled
into
the
wilderness
.
and
the
servants
of
Laban
did
not
overtake
us
,
and
we
hid
ourselves
in
the
cavity
of
a
rock
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Laman
was
angry
with
me
,
and
also
with
my
father
;
and
also
was
Lemuel
;
for
he
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
Laman
.
Wherefore
Laman
and
Lemuel
did
speak
many
hard
words
unto
us
,
their
younger
brothers
,
and
they
did
smite
us
even
with
a
rod
.
And
it
came
to
pass
as
they
smote
us
with
a
rod
,
behoid
an
angel
uf
the
Lord
came
and
stood
before
them
,
and
he
spake
unto
them
,
saying
,
why
do
ye
smite
your
younger
brother
with
a
rod
?
Know
ye
not
that
the
Lord
hath
chosen
him
to
be
a
ruler
over
you
,
and
this
because
of
your
iniquities
?
Behold
ye
shall
f
up
to
Jerusalem
again
,
and
the
Lord
will
deliver
Laban
into
your
hands
.
And
after
the
angel
had
spoken
unto
us
,
he
departed
.
And
after
the
angel
had
departed
,
Laman
and
Lemuel
again
began
to
murmut
,
saying
,
how
is
it
possible
that
the
Lord
will
deliver
Laban
into
our
hands
?
Behold
he
is
a
mighty
man
,
and
he
can
command
fifty
,
yea
,
even
he
canslay
ty
;
then
why
not
us
?
d
it
came
to
pass
that
I
spake
unto
my
brethren
,
saying
,
let
us
go
up
again
unto
Jerusalem
,
and
let
us
[File:012]
be
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
;
for
behold
he
is
mightier
than
all
the
earth
,
then
why
not
mightier
than
Laban
and
his
fifty
,
yea
,
or
even
than
his
tens
of
thousands
.
Therefore
letus
go
up
;
let
us
be
strong
like
unto
Moses
;
for
he
truly
spake
unto
the
waters
of
the
Red
Sea
,
and
they
divided
hither
and
thither
,
and
our
fathers
came
through
out
of
captivity
on
dry
ground
,
and
the
armies
of
Pharaoh
did
follow
and
were
drowned
in
the
waters
of
the
Red
Sea
.
Now
behold
ye
know
that
this
is
true
;
and
ye
also
know
that
an
angel
hath
spoken
unto
you
,
wherefore
eanye
doubt
?
Let
us
go
up
;
the
Lord
is
able
to
deliver
us
,
even
as
our
fathers
,
and
to
destroy
Laban
,
even
as
the
Egyptians
.
Now
when
I
had
spoken
these
words
,
they
were
yet
wroth
,
and
did
still
continue
to
murmur
;
nevertheless
they
did
follow
me
up
until
we
came
without
the
walls
:
_
of
Jerusalem
.
And
it
was
by
night
;
and
I
caused
that
they
should
hide
themselves
without
the
walls
,
And
after
they
had
hid
themselves
,
I
,
Nephi
,
crept
into
the
city
and
went
forth
towards
the
house
of
Laban
.
And
was
led
by
the
spirit
,
not
knowing
beforehand
the
things
which
should
do
.
Nevertheless
1
went
forth
,
and
as
I
came
near
unto
the
house
of
Laban
,
I
beheld
a
man
,
and
he
had
fallen
to
the
earth
before
me
,
for
he
was
drunken
with
wine
.
And
when
I
came
to
him
,
I
found
that
it
was
Laban
.
And
I
beheld
his
sword
,
and
I
drew
it
forth
from
the
sheath
thereof
,
and
the
hilt
thereof
was
of
pure
gold
,
and
the
workmanship
thereof
was
exceeding
fine
;
and
I
saw
that
the
blade
thereof
was
of
the
most
precious
steel
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
1
was
constrained
by
the
spirit
that
I
should
kill
Laban
;
but
I
said
in
my
heart
,
never
at
any
time
have
shed
the
blood
of
man
,
and
I
shrunk
and
would
that
I
might
not
slay
him
.
And
the
spirit
said
unto
me
again
,
behold
the
Lord
hath
delivered
him
into
thy
hands
;
yea
,.
and
I
also
knew
that
he
had
sought
to
take
away
mine
own
life
;
yea
,
and
he
would
not
hearken
unto
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
;
and
he
also
had
taken
away
-
our
property
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
spirit
said
unto
me
again
,
slay
him
,
for
the
Lord
hath
delivered
him
.
into
thy
hands
.
Behold
the
Lord
slayeth
the
wicked
to
bring
forth
his
:
righteous
:
purposes
:
It
is
better
.
that
one
man
should
perish
,
than
that
a
nation
should
dwindle
and
perish
in
unbelief
.
:
[File:013]
And
now
,
when
I
,
Nephi
,
had
heard
these
words
,
I
remembered
the
words
of
the
Lord
which
he
spake
unto
me
in
the
wilderness
,
saying
,
that
inasmuch
as
thy
seed
shall
keep
my
commandments
,
they
shall
prosper
in
.
the
land
of
promise
.
Yea
,
and
I
also
thought
that
they
could
not
keep
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
according
to
the
law
of
Moses
,
save
they
should
have
the
law
.
And
I
also
knew
that
the
law
was
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
.
And
again
.
I
knew
that
the
Lord
had
delivered
Laban
into
my
hands
for
this
cause
,
that
I
might
obtain
the
records
according
to
his
commandments
.
Therefore
.
I
did
obey
the
voice
or
the
spirit
,
and
took
Laban
by
the
hair
of
the
head
,
and
I
smote
off
his
head
with
his
own
sword
.
And
after
I
had
smitten
off
his
head
with
his
own
sword
,
I
took
the
garments
of
Laban
and
put
them
upon
mine
own
body
;
yea
,
even
every
whit
;
and
I
did
gird
on
his
armor
about
my
loins
.
And
after
I
had
done
this
,
I
went
forth
unto
the
treasury
of
Laban
.
Andas
I
went
forth
towards
the
treasury
of
Laban
,
behold
I
saw
the
servant
of
Laban
who
had
the
keys
of
the
treasury
.
And
I
commanded
him
in
the
voice
of
Laban
,
that
he
should
go
with
me
into
the
treasury
;
and
he
supposed
me
to
be
his
master
,
Laban
,
for
he
beheld
the
garments
,
and
also
the
sword
girded
about
my
loins
.
And
he
spake
unto
me
concerning
the
elders
of
the
Jews
,
he
knowing
that
his
master
Laban
had
been
out
by
night
among
them
.
And
I
spake
unto
him
as
ifit
had
been
Laban
.
And
f
also
spake
unto
him
that
I
should
carry
the
engravings
which
were
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
to
my
elder
brethren
,
who
were
without
the
walls
.
And
I
also
bade
him
that
he
should
follow
me
.
And
he
supposing
that
I
spake
of
the
brethren
of
the
church
,
and
that
I
was
truly
that
Laban
whom
I
had
slain
,
wherefore
he
did
follow
me
.
And
he
spake
unto
me
many
times
concerning
the
elders
.
of
the
Jews
,
as
I
went
forth
unto
my
brethren
,
who
were
without
the
walls
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Laman
saw
me
,
he
was
exceedingly
frightened
,
and
also
Lemuel
and
Sam
.
And
.
they
fled
from
before
my
presence
;
for
they
supposed
it
was
Laban
,
and
that
he
had
slain
me
,
and
had
sought
to
take
away
their
lives
also
.
And
it
:
eame'
to
pass
that
I
called
after
them
,
and
they
:
did
::
hear
:
me
;
wherefore
they
did
cease
to
fiee
from
my
presence
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
sevant
of
Laban
beheld
my
brethren
,
he
began
to
[File:014]
tremble
,
and
was
about
to
flee
from
before
me
and
return
to
the
city
of
Jerusalem
.
And
now
I
,
Nephi
,
being
a
man
large
in
stature
,
and
also
having
received
much
strength
of
the
Lord
,
therefore
I
did
seize
upon
the
servart
of
Laban
,
and
held
him
,
that
he
should
not
flee
.
And
it
came
.
to
pass
that
I
spake
with
him
,
that
if
he
would
hearken
unto
my
words
,
as
the
Lord
liveth
and
as
I
live
,
even
so
that
if
he
would
hearken
unto
our
words
,
we
would
spare
his
life
.
And
I
spake
unto
him
,
even
with
an
oath
,
that
he
need
not
fear
;
that
he
should
be
a
free
man
like
unto
us
,
if
he
would
go
down
in
the
wilderness
with
us
.
And
I
also
spake
unto
him
,
saying
,
surely
the
Lord
hath
commanded
us
to
do
this
thing
,
and
shall
we
not
be
diligent
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
?
Therefore
,
if
thou
wilt
go
down
into
the
wilderness
to
my
father
,
thou
shalt
have
place
with
us
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Zoram
did
take
courage
at
the
words
which
I
spake
.
Now
Zoram
was
the
name
of
the
servant
;
and
he
promised
that
he
would
go
down
into
the
wilderness
unte
my
father
.
And
he
also
made
an
oath
unto
us
,
that
he
would
tarry
with
us
from
that
time
forth
.
Nuw
we
were
desirous
that
he
should
tarry
wita
us
for
this
cause
,
that
the
Jews
might
not
know
concerning
our
flight
into
the
wilderness
,
lest
they
should
pursue
us
and
destroy
us
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Zoram
had
made
an
oath
unto
us
,
our
fears
did
cease
concerning
him
..
And
it
came
to
pass
thal
!
we
took
the
plates
of
brass
and
the
servant
.
of
Laban
,
and
departed
into
the
wilderness
,
and
journeyed
unto
the
tent
of
our
father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
came
down
into
the
wilderness
unto
our
father
,
behold
he
was
filled
with
Joy
:
and
also
my
mother
,
Sariah
,
was
exceeding
glad
,
for
she
truly
had
mourned
because
of
us
;
for
she
had
supposed
that
we
had
perished
in
the
wilderness
;
and
she
also
had
complained
against
my
father
,
telling
him
that
he
was
a
visionary
man
;
saying
,
behold
thou
hast
led
us
forth
from
the
land
of
our
inher
.
itanee
,
and
my
sons
are
no
more
,
and
we
perish
in
the
wilderness
.
And
after
this
manner
of
language
had
my
mother
complained
against
my
father
.
And
it
had
came
to
pass
that
my
father
spake
unto
her
saying
,
I
know
that
I
am
a
visionary
man
;
for
if
I
had
not
seen
the
things
of
God
in
a
vision
,
I
should
not
have
known
the
goodness
of
God
,
but
had
tarried
[File:015]
at
Jerusalem
and
had
perished
with
my
brethren
.
But
behold
,
I
have
ootained
a
land
of
promise
,
in
the
which
things
I
do
rejoice
;
yea
,
and
I
know
that
the
Lord
will
deliver
my
sons
out
of
the
handsof
Laban
,
and
brin
them
down
again
unto
us
in
the
wilderness
.
And
after
this
manner
of
language
did
my
father
Lehi
comfort
my
mother
Sariah
,
concerning
us
,
while
we
journied
in
the
wilderness
up
to
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
to
obtain
the
record
of
the
Jews
.
And
when
we
had
returned
to
the
tent
of
my
father
,
behold
their
joy
was
fall
,
and
my
mother
was
comforted
:
and
she
spake
,
saying
,
now
I
know
ofa
surety
that
the
Lord
hath
commanded
my
husband
to
flee
into
the
wilderness
;
yea
,
and
I
also
know
of
a
surety
that
the
Lord
hath
protected
my
sons
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
Laban
,
and
gave
them
power
whereby
they
could
accomplish
the
thing
which
the
Lord
hath
commanded
them
.
And
after
this
manner
of
language
did
she
speak
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
reine
exceedingly
,
and
did
offer
sacrifice
and
burnt
offerings
unto
the
Lord
;
and
they
gave
thanks
unto
the
God
of
Israel
.
And
after
they
had
given
thanks
unto
the
God
of
Israel
,
my
father
Lehi
took
the
records
which
were
engrayen
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
and
he
did
.
search
them
from
the
beginning
.
And
he
beheld
that
they
did
contain
the
five
books
of
Moses
,
which
gave
an
account
of
the
creation
of
the
world
,
and
also
of
Adam
and
Eve
,
who
were
our
first
parents
;
and
also
a
record
of
the
Jews
irom
thevbeginning
,
even
down
to
the
commencement
of
the
reign
of
Zedekiah
,
king
of
Judah
;
and
also
the
prophecies
of
the
holy
prophets
,
from
the
beginning
,
even
down
to
the
commencement
of
the
reign
of
Zedekiah
;
and
also
many
prophecies
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
Jeremiah
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
my
father
Lehi
also
found
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
a
genealogy
of
his
fathers
;
wherefore
he
knew
that
he
was
a
.
descendant
of
Joseph
;
yea
,
even
that
Joseph
who
was
the
son
of
Jacob
,
who
was
sold
into
Egypt
,
and
who
was
preserved
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
that
he
might
preserve
his
father
Jacob
and
all
his
household
from
perishing
with
famine
.
And
they
were
also
led
out
of
captivity
and
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
,
by
that
.
same
God
who
had
preserved
them
.
.
And
thus
my
father
Lehi
did
discover
the
genealogy
.
of
his
fathers
.
And
Laban
also
was
a
[File:016]
descendant
of
Joseph
,
wherefore
he
and
his
fathers
had
kept
the
records
.
.
And
now
when
my
father
saw
all
these
things
,
he
was
filled
with
the
spirit
,
and
began
to
prophesy
concerning
his
seed
;
that
these
plates
of
brass
should
go
forth
unto
all
nations
,
kindreds
,
tongues
and
people
who
were
of
his
seed
.
Wherefore
he
said
that
these
plates
of
brass
should
never
perish
;
neither
should
they
be
dimmed
any
more
by
time
.
And
he
prophesied
many
things
concerning
his
seed
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
far
I
and
my
father
had
kept
the
commandments
wherewith
the
Lord
had
commanded
us
.
And
we
had
obtained
the
record
which
the
Lord
had
commanded
us
,
and
searched
them
and
found
that
they
were
desirable
;
yea
,
even
of
great
worth
unto
us
,
insomuch
that
we
could
preserve
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
unto
our
children
.
Whereforeit
was
wisdom
in
the
Lord
that
we
should
carry
them
with
us
,
as
we
journied
in
the
wilderness
towards
the
land
of
promise
.
CHAPTER
II
.
Anp
now
I
,
Nephi
,
do
not
give
the
genealogy
of
my
fathers
in
this
part
of
my
record
;
neither
at
any
time
shall
I
give
it
after
upon
these
plates
which
I
am
writing
;
for
it
is
given
in
the
record
which
has
been
kept
by
iy
father
;
wherefore
donot
write
it
in
this
work
.
For
it
sufficeth
me
to
say
,
that
we
are
a
descendant
of
Joseph
.
And
it
mattereth
not
to
me
that
I
am
particular
to
give
a
full
account
of
all
the
things
of
my
father
,
for
they
cannot
be
written
upon
these
plates
,
for
[
desire
the
room
that
I
may
write
of
the
things
of
God
.
For
the
fullness
of
mine
intent
is
that
may
persuade
men
to
come
unto
the
God
of
Abraham
,
and
the
God
of
Isaac
,
and
the
God
of
Jacob
,
and
be
saved
.
Wherefore
the
things
which
are
pleasing
unto
the
world
,
I
do
not
write
,
but
the
things
which
are
pleasing
unto
God
and
unto
those
who
are
not
of
the
world
.
Wherefore
I
shall
give
commandment
unto
my
seed
,
that
they
shall
not
occupy
these
plates
with
things
which
are
not
of
worth
unto
the
children
of
men
.
[File:017]
And
now
I
would
that
ye
might
know
,
that
after
my
father
Lehi
had
made
an
end
of
prophesying
concerning
his
seed
,
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
spake
unto
hin
:
again
,
saying
,
that
it
was
not
meet
for
him
,
Lehi
,
that
he
should
take
his
family
into
the
wilderness
alone
;
but
that
his
sons
should
take
daughters
to
wife
,
that
they
might
raise
up
seed
unto
the
Lord
in
the
land
of
promise
.
.
;
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
commanded
him
that
I
,
Nephi
,
and
my
brethren
,
should
again
return
unto
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
and
bring
down
Ishmael
and
his
family
into
the
wilderness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
again
,
with
my
brethren
,
go
forth
into
the
wilderness
to
go
up
to
Jerusalem
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
went
up
unto
the
house
of
Ishmael
,
and
we
did
gain
favor
in
the
sight
of
Ishmael
,
insomuch
that
we
did
speak
unto
him
the
words
of
the
Lord
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
soften
the
heart
of
Ishmael
,
and
also
his
household
,
insomuch
that
they
tock
their
journey
with
us
down
into
the
wilderness
to
the
tent
of
our
father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
we
journied
in
the
wilderness
,
behold
,
Laman
and
Lemuel
,
and
two
of
the
daughters
of
Ishmael
,
aad
the
two
sons
of
Ishmael
,
and
their
families
,
didrebel
against
us
;
yea
,
against
I
,
Nephi
,
and
Sam
,
and
their
father
Ishmael
,
and
his
wife
,
and
his
three
other
daughters
.
And
it
cameto
pass
in
the
which
rebellion
,
they
were
desirous
to
.,
return
unto
the
land
of
Jerusalem
.
And
now
I
,
Nephi
,
being
grieved
for
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
,
therefore
I
spake
unto
them
,
saying
;
yea
,
even
unto
Laman
and
unto
Lemuel
,
behold
,
thou
art
mine
elder
brethren
;
and
how
is
it
that
ye
are
so
hard
in
your
hearts
,
and
so
blind
in
your
minds
,
that
ye
have
need
that
I
,
your
younger
brother
,
should
speak
unto
you
,
yea
,
and
set
an
example
for
yout
How
is
it
that
ye
have
:
not
hearkened
unto
the
word
of
the
Lord
?
ow
is
it
that
ye
have
forgotten
that
ye
have
seen
an
angel
of
the
Lord
?
Yea
,
and
how
is
it
that
ye
.
have
forgotten
what
great
things
the
Lord
hath
done
for
us
,
in
delivering
us
out
of
the
hands
of
Laban
,
.
and
also
that
we
should
obtain
the
record
?
Yea
,
and
how
isit
that
ye
have
forgotten
that
the
Lord
is
able
to
de
all
:
things
,
according
to
his
will
,
for
the
children
of
men
,
if
it
so
be
that
they
exercise
faith
in
him
:
wherefore
let
us
be
faithful
to
him
;
And
if
it
so
-
be
that
we
are
[File:018]
faithful
to
him
,
we
shall
obtain
the
land
of
promise
;
and
ye
shall
know
at
some
future
period
,
that
the
word
of
the
Lord
shall
be
fulfilled
,
concerning
the
destruction
of
Jerusalem
;
for
all
things
which
the
Lord
hath
spoken
concerning
the
destruction
of
Jerusalem
,
must
be
fulfilled
.
For
behold
,
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
ceaseth
soon
to
strive
with
them
;
for
behold
,
they
have
rejected
the
prophets
,
and
Jeremiah
have
they
cast
into
prison
.
And
they
have
sought
to
take
away
the
life
of
my
father
,
insomuch
that
they
have
driven
him
out
of
the
land
.
Now
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
if
ye
will
return
unto
Jerusalem
,
ye
shall
also
perish
with
them
.
And
now
,
if
ye
have
choice
,
go
up
to
the
land
,
and
remember
the
words
which
I
speak
unto
you
,
that
if
ye
go
,
ye
will
also
perish
;
for
thus
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
constraineth
me
that
J
should
speak
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
,
Nephi
,
had
spoken
these
words
unto
my
brethren
,
they
were
angry
with
me
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
lay
their
hands
upon
me
.
for
behold
,
they
were
exceeding
wroth
.
and
they
did
bind
me
with
cords
,
for
they
sought
to
take
away
my
life
,
that
they
might
leave
me
in
the
wilderness
,
to
be
devoured
by
wild
beasts
.
But
it
came
te
pass
that
prayed
unto
the
Lord
,
saying
,
O
Lord
,
according
to
my
faith
which
is
in
thee
,
wilt
thou
deliver
me
from
the
hands
of
my
brethren
;
yea
,
even
give
me
strength
that
I
may
burst
these
bands
with
which
I
am
bound
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
had
said
these
words
,
behold
,
the
bands
were
loosed
from
off
my
hands
and
feet
,
and
[
stood
before
my
brethren
,
and
I
spake
unto
themagain
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
angry
with
me
again
,
and
sought
to
lay
hands
upon
me
;
but
behold
,
one
of
the
daughters
of
Ishmael
,
yea
,
and
also
her
mother
,
and
one
.
of
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
did
plead
with
my
brethren
,
insomuch
that
they
did
soften
their
hearts
;
and
they
did
cease
striving
to
take
away
my
life
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
sorrowful
,
because
of
their
wickedness
,
insomuch
that
they
did
bow
down
before
me
,
and
did
plead
with
me
,
that
I
would
forgive
them
of
the
thing
that
they
had
done
against
me
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
frankly
forgive
them
all
that
they
had
done
,
and
I
did
exhort
them
that
they
would
pray
unto
the
Lord
their
God
,
for
forgiveness
.
[File:019]
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
so
.
And
afler
they
had
done
praying
unto
the
Lord
,
we
did
again
travel
on
our
journey
toward
the
tent
of
our
father
.
-
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
come
down
unto
the
tent
of
our
father
.
And
after
I
and
my
brethren
,
and
all
the
house
of
Ishmael
,
had
.
come
down
unto
the
tent
of
my
father
,
they
did
give
thanks
unto
the
Lord
their
God
;
and
they
did
offer
sacrifice
and
burnt
offerings
unto
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
had
gathered
together
all
manner
of
seeds
of
every
kind
;
both
ot
grain
and
of
every
kind
,
and
also
of
the
seeds
of
fruits
of
every
kind
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
while
my
father
tarried
in
the
wilderness
,
he
spake
unto
us
,
saying
,
behold
,
I
have
dreamed
a
dream
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
[have
seen
a
vision
.
And
behold
,
because
of
the
thing
which
have
seen
,
I
have
reason
to
rejoice
in
the
Lord
because
of
Nephi
,
and
also
of
Sam
;
for
I
have
reason
to
suppose
that
they
,
and
also
many
of
their
seed
,
will
be
saved
.
But
behold
,
Laman
and
Lemuel
,
I
fear
exceedingly
because
of
you
;
for
behold
,
me
thought
I
saw
in
my
dream
,
a
dark
and
dreary
wilderness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
J
saw
a
man
,
and
he
was
dressed
in
a
white
robe
:
and
he
came
and
stood
before
me
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
spake
unto
me
,
and
bade
me
followhim
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
I
followed
him''I
beheld
myself
that
I
was
in
a
dark
and
dreary
waste
.
And
after
I
had
travelled
for
the
space
of
many
hours
in
darkness
,
I
began
to
pray
unto
the
Lord
,
that
he
would
have
mercy
on
me
,
according
to
the
multitude
of
his
tender
mercies
.
And
it
came
to
pass
after
I
had
prayed
unto
the
Lord
,
I
beheld
a
large
and
spacious
field
.
And
it
.
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
a
tree
,
whose
fruit
was
desirable
,
to
make
one
happy
.
And
it
came
to
,
pass
that
I
-
did
go
forth
,
and
partake
of
the
fruit
thereof
;
and
I
.
beheld
that
it
was
,
most
sweet
,
above
all
that
I
ever
beforetasted
.
Yea
,
and
I
beheld
that
the
fruit
thereof
was
white
,.
to
.
exceed
all
the
whiteness
that
I
had
ever
,
seen
..
And
as
I
.
partook
of
the
fruit
thereof
,
it
filled
my
-
soul
with
exceeding
grent
Joys
wherefore
,
1
began
to
.
be
-
desirouis
that
my
amily
should
partake
of
it
also
;
for
I
knew
that
it
.
was
desirable
above
all
other
fruit
.
And
as
I
cast
my
eyes
round
about
,
that
perhaps
I
might
discover
my
family
also
,
I
beheld
a
river
of
water
;
and
it
ran
along
,
and
it
was
near
the
tree
of
which
I
was
partaking
the
fruit
.
[File:020]
And
I
looked
to
behold
from
whence
it
came
;
and
I
saw
the
head
thereof
a
little
way
off
;
and
at
the
head
thereof
,
I
beheld
your
mother
Sariah
,
and
Sam
,
and
Nephi
;
and
they
stood
as
if
they
knew
not
whither
they
should
go
.
nd
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beckoned
unto
them
;
and
I
also
did
say
unto
them
,
with
a
loud
voice
,
that
the
should
come
unto
me
,
and
partake
of
the
fruit
,
whic
was
desirable
above
all
other
fruit
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
come
unto
me
,
and
partake
of
the
fruit
also
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
1
was
desirous
that
Laman
and
Lemuel
should
come
and
partake
of
the
fruit
also
;
wherefore
,
I
cast
mine
eyes
towards
the
head
of
the
river
,
that
perhaps
I
might
see
them
.
'
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Isaw
them
,
but
they
would
not
come
untome
.
And
I
beheld
a
rod
of
iron
;
and
it
extended
along
the
bank
of
the
river
,
and
led
to
the
tree
by
which
I
stood
.
And
I
also
beheld
a
straight
and
narrow
path
,
which
came
along
by
the
red
of
iron
,
even
to
the
tree
by
which
I
stood
;
andit
also
led
by
the
head
of
the
fountain
,
unto
a
large
and
spacious
field
,
as
if
ithad
been
a
world
;
and
I
saw
numberless
concourses
of
people
;
many
of
whom
were
pressing
forward
,
that
they
might
obtain
the
path
which
led
unto
the
tree
by
which
I
stood
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
come
forth
,
and
commence
in
the
path
which
led
to
the
tree
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
arose
a
mist
of
darkness
;
yea
,
even
an
exceeding
great
mist
of
darkness
,
insomuch
that
they
who
had
commenced
in
the
path
,
did
lose
their
way
,
that
they
wandered
off
and
were
lost
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
others
pressing
torward
;
and
they
came
forth
,
and
caught
hold
of
the
end
of
the
rod
of
iron
;
and
they
did
press
forward
through
the
mist
of
darkness
,
clinging
to
the
rod
of
iron
,
even
until
they
did
:
come
forth
and
partake
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
.
And
after
they
had
partaken
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
,
they
did
cast
their
eyes
about
as
if
they
were
ashamed
.
And
I
also
cast
my
eyes
round
about
,
and
beheld
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
of
water
,
a
great
and
spacious
building
;
and
it
stood
as
it
were
in
the
air
;
high
above
the
earth
;
and
it
was
filled
with
people
,
both
old
and
young
,
both
male
and
female
;
and
their
manner
of
dress
was
exceeding
fine
;
and
they
were
in
the
attitude
of
mocking
and
pointing
their
fingers
towards
those
who
had
come
at
,
and
were
[File:021]
partaking
of
the
fruit
.
And
after
they
had
tasted
of
the
fruit
,
they
were
ashamed
,
because
of
those
that
were
scoffing
at
them
;
and
they
fell
away
into
forbidden
paths
and
were
lost
.
And
now
I
,
Nephi
,
do
not
speak
all
the
words
of
my
father
.
But
to
be
short
in
writing
,
behold
,
he
saw
other
multitudes
pressing
forward
;
and
they
came
and
caught
hold
of
the
end
of
the
rod
of
iron
;
and
they
did
press
their
way
forward
,
continually
holding
fast
to
the
rod
of
iron
,
until
they
came
forth
and
fell
down
and
partook
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
.
And
he
also
saw
other
multitudes
,
feeling
their
way
towards
that
great
and
spacious
building
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
many
were
drowned
in
the
depths
of
the
fountain
;
and
many
were
lost
from
his
view
,
wandering
in
strange
roads
.
And
great
was
the
multitude
that
did
enter
into
that
strange
building
..
And
after
they
did
enter
into
that
building
,
they
did
point
the
finger
of
scorn
at
me
,
and
those
that
were
partaking
of
the
fruit
also
;
but
we
heeded
them
not
.
These
are
the
words
of
my
father
:
For
as
many
as
heeded
them
,
had
fallenaway
.
And
Lamanand
Lemuel
partook
not
of
the
fruit
,
said
my
father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
after
my
father
had
spoken
all
the
words
of
his
dream
or
vision
,
which
were
many
,
he
said
unto
us
,
because
of
these
things
which
he
saw
in
a
vision
,
he
.
exceedingly
feared
for
Laman
and
Lemuel
;
yea
,
he
feared
lest
they
should
be
cast
off
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
;
and
he
did
exhort
them
then
with
all
the
feeling
of
a
tender
parent
,
that
they
would
hearken
to
his
words
,
that
,
perhaps
the
Lord
would
be
merciful
to
them
,
and
not
cast
them
off
;
yea
,
my
father
did
preach
unto
them
.
And
after
he
had
preached
unto
them
,
and
also
prophesied
unto
them
of
many
things
,
he
bade
them
:
to
keep
the
.
commandments
of
the
Lord
;
and
he
did
:
cease
speaking
unto
them
.
And
all
these
things
did
my
father
see
,
and
hear
,
and
,
speak
,
as
he
dwelt
in
a
tent
,
in
the
valley
of
Lemuel
;
and
also
a
great
many
more
things
,
which
cannot
be
written
upon
these
plates
.
And
now
,
as
I
have
spoken
concerning
these
plates
,
behold
,
they
are
not
the
plates
upon
which
I
make
a
full
account
of
the
history
of
my
people
;
for
the
plates
upon
which
I
makea
full
account
of
my
people
,
I
have
given
the
name
of
Nephi
;
wherefore
,
they
are
called
the
plates
of
Nephi
,
after
mine
own
name
;
and
these
plates
also
,
are
called
the
piates
of
Nephi
,
[File:022]
Nevertheless
,
I
have
received
a
commandment
of
the
Lord
,
that
J
should
make
these
plates
,
for
the
special
purpose
that
there
should
be
an
account
engraver
of
the
ministry
of
my
people
.
Upon
the
other
plates
should
be
engraven
an
account
of
the
reign
of
the
kings
,
and
the
wars
and
contentions
of
my
people
;
wherefore
,
these
plates
are
for
the
more
part
of
the
ministry
;
and
the
other
plates
are
for
the
more
part
of
the
reign
of
the
kings
,
and
the
vars
,
and
contentions
of
my
people
.
Wherefore
,
the
Lord
hath
commanded
me
to
make
these
plates
,
for
a'wise
purpose
in
him
:
which
purpose
I
know
not
.
But
the
Lord
knoweth
all
things
from
the
beginning
;
wherefore
,
he
prepareth
a
way
to
accomplish
all
his
works
among
the
children
of
men
;
for
behold
,
he
hath
all
power
unto
the
fulfilling
of
all
his
words
.
And
thus
it
is
.
Amen
,

CHAPTER
.
II
.
Axp
now
I
,
Nephi
,
proceed
to
give
an
account
upon
these
plates
,
of
my
proceedings
,
and
my
reign
and
.
ministry
;
wherefore
,
to
proceed
with
mine
account
,
of
must
speak
somewhat
of
the
things
of
my
father
,
and
also
of
my
brethren
.
13
For
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
after
my
father
had
mate
an
end
of
speaking
the
words
of
his
dream
,
and
.
also'of
exhorting
them
to
all
dilligence
,
he
spake
unto
them
concerning
the
Jews
,
that
after
they
should
be
destroyed
,
even
that
great
city
Jerusalem
,
and
many
be'earried
away
captive
into
Babylon
,
according
to
the
own
due
time
of
the
Lord
,
they
should
return
again
;
yea
,
even
be
brought
back
out
of
captivity
;
and
after
they
should
be
brought
back
out
of
captivity
they
should
possess
again
the
land
of
their
inheritance
.
Yea
,
even
six
hundred
years
from
the
time
:
that
my
father
left
Jerusalem
,
a
prophet
would
the
lord
God
raise
up
among
the
Jews
;
even
a
Messiah
;
or
,
in
oth
.
er
words
,
a
Savior
of
the
world
.
And
he
also
spake
concerning
the
prophets
,
how
great
a
number
had
testified
of
these
things
,
concerning
this
Messiah
,
of
whom
he
had
spoken
,
or
this
Redeemer
of
the
world
.
Wherefore
,
all
mankind
were
in
a
lost
and
in
a
fallen
[File:023]
state
,
and
ever
would
be
,
save
they
should
rely
on
this
Redeemer
.
And
he
spake
also
,
concerning
a
prophet
,
who
should
come
before
the
Messiah
,
to
prepare
the
way
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
even
he
should
go
forth
and
cry
in
the
wilderness
,
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
Lord
,
and
make
his
paths
straight
;
for
there
standeth
one
among
you
whom
ye
know
not
;
and
he
is
mightier
than
I
,
whose
shoe's
latchet
I
am
not
worthy
to
unloose
.
And
much
spake
my
father
concerning
this
thing
.
And
my
father
said
he
should
baptise
in
Bethabary
,
beyond
Jordan
;
and
he
also
said
he
should
baptise
with
water
;
even
that
he
should
baptise
the
Messiah
with
water
.
And
after
he
had
baptised
the
Messiah
with
water
,
he
should
behold
and
bear
record
,
that
he
had
baptised
the
Lamb
of
God
,
who
should
take
away
the
sins
of
the
world
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
after
my
father
had
spoken
these
words
,
he
spake
unto
my
brethren
concerning
the
gospel
which
should
be
preached
among
the
Jews
;
and
also
concerning
the
dwindling
of
the
Jews
in
unbelief
.
And
afler
they
had
slain
the
Messiah
who
should
come
,
and
after
he
had
been
slain
,
he
should
rise
from
the
dead
,
and
should
make
himself
manifest
,
by
the
Holy
Ghost
,
unto
the
Gentiles
.
Yea
,
even
my
father
spake
much
concerning
the
Gentiles
,
and
also
concerning
the
house
of
Israel
,
that
they
should
be
compared
like
unto
an
olive
tree
,
whose
branches
should
be
broken
off
,
and
should
be
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
.
Wherefore
,
he
said
it
must
needs
be
that
we
should
be
led
with
one
accord
,
into
the
land
of
promise
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
word
of
the
Lord
,
that
we
should
be
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
.
Andafter
the
house
of
Israel
should
be
scattered
,
they
should
be
gathered
together
again
;
or
,
in
fine
,
after
the
Gentiles
had
received
the
fulness
of
the
gospel
,
the
natural
branches
of
the
olive
tree
,
or
the
remnants
of
the
house
of
Israel
,
should
be
grafted
in
,
or
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
true
Messiah
,
their
Lord
and
their
Redeemer
.
And
after
this
manner
of
language
did
my
father
prophesy
and
speak
unto
my
brethren
;
and
also
many
more
things
,
which
I
do
not
write
in
this
book
;
for
I
have
written
as
many
of
them
as
were
expedient
for
me
in
mine
other
book
.
And
all
these
things
of
which
I
have
spoken
,
were
[File:024]
done
as
my
father
dwelt
ina
tent
,
in
the
valley
of
Lemuel
.
;
And
it
came
to
pasr
after
I
,
Nephi
,
having
heard
all
the
words
of
my
father
,
concerning
the
mine
which
he
saw
in
a
vision
;
and
also
the
things
which
he
spake
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;
which
power
he
received
by
faith
on
the
Son
of
God
;
and
the
Son
of
God
was
the
Messiah
,
who
should
come
.
I
,
Nephi
,
was
desirous
also
,
that
I
might
see
,
and
hear
,
and
know
of
these
things
,
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
which
is
the
gift
of
God
unto
all
those
who
diligently
seek
him
,
as
well
in
times
of
old
as
in
the
time
that
he
should
manifest
himself
unto
the
children
of
men
;
for
he
is
the
same
yesterday
,
to-day
,
and
forever
;
and
the
way
is
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
,
if
it
so
be
that
they
repent
and
come
unto
him
;
for
he
that
diligently
seeketh
,
shall
find
;
and
the
mysteries
of
God
shall
be
unfolded
unto
them
,
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
as
well
in
these
times
as
in
times
of
.
old
;
and
as
well
in
times
of
old
as
in
times
tocome
;
wherefore
,
the
course
of
the
Lord
is
one
eternal
round
.
'
Therefore
,
remember
,
O
man
,
for
all
thy
doings
,
thou
shalt
be
brought
into
judgment
.
Wherefore
,
if
ye
have
sought
to
do
wickedly
in
the
days
of
your
probation
,
then
ye
are
found
unclean
befofe
the
Judgment
seat
of
God
;
and
no
unclean
thing
can
dwell
:
with
,
God
;
wherefore
,
ye
must
be
cast
off
forever
...
And
the
Holy
Ghost
giveth
authority
that
I
should
speak
these
things
and
deny
them
not
.
ee
For
it
came
to
pass
afier
I
had
desired
to
know'
the
things
that
my
father
had
seen
,
and
believing
that
the
Lord
was
able
to
make
them
known
unto'me
,.
as
I
sat
pondering
in
mine
heart
,
I
was
caught
away
in
the
Spirit
of
the
Lord
,
yea
,
into
an
exceeding
high
mountain
,
which
T
never
had
before
seen
,
and
upon
which
T
never
had
before
sat
my
foot
.
And
the
spirit
said
unto
me
,
behold
,
what
desirest
thou
?
And
I
said
,
I
desire
to
behold
the
things
which
my
father
saw
.
And
the
spirit
said
unto
me
,
believest
thou
that
thy
father
saw
the
tree
ot
which
he
hath
spoken
?
And
I
said
yea
,
thou
knowest
that
I
believe
all
the
words
of
my
father
.
And
when
I
had
spoken
these
words
,
the
spirit
eried
with
a
loud
voice
,
saying
,
hosanna
to
the
Lord
,
the
most
high
God
;
for
he
is
God
over
all
the
earth
,
yea
,
even
above
all
:
And
blessed
art
thou
,
Nephi
,
because
thou
believest
in
the
Son
of
the
most
high
God
;
where
[File:025]
fore
,
thou
shalt
behold
the
things
which
thou
hast
desired
.
And
behold
,
this
thing
shall
be
given
unto
thee
for
a
sign
,
that
after
thou
hast
beheld'
the
tree
which
bore
the
fruit
which
thy
father
tasted
,
thou
-
shalt
also
behold
a
man
descending
out
of
heaven
,
and
him
shall
e
witness
;
and
after
ye
have
witnessed
him
,
ye
shall
leat
record
that
itis
the
Son
of
God
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
spirit
said
unto
me
look
!
and
I
looked
and
beheld
a
tree
;
and
it
was
like
unto
the
tree
.
which
my
father
had
seen
;
and
the
beauty
thereof
was
far
beyond
,
yea
,
exceeding
of
all
beauty
;
and
the
whiteness
thereof
did
excced
the
whiteness
of
the
driven
snow
.
Soeead
And
it
came
to
pass
after
Thad
seen
the
tree
,
I
said
unto
the
spirit
,
I
behold
,
thou
hast
shewn
unto
me
the
tree
which
.
is
precious
above
all
.
And
he
said
unto
me
,
what
desirest
.
thou
?
And
T
said
unto
him
,
to
know
the
interpretation
thereof
;
for
1
spake
unto
him
as
aman
speaketh
;
for
I
beheld
that
he
was
in
the
form
of
a
man
;
yet
,
nevertheless
,
i
knew
that
it
was
the
spirit
of
the
tpt
and
he
spake
unto
me
as
a
man
speaketh
with
another
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
me
look
!
and
T
looked
as
ifto
look
upon
him
,
andI
saw
him
not
;
for
he
had
gone
from
before
my
presence
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
locked
and
beheld
the
great
city
of
Jerusalem
,
and
also
other
cities
.
And
I
beheld
the
city
of
Nazareth
:
and
in
the
city
of
Nazareth
I
beheld
a
virgin

and
she
was
exceedingly
fair
and
white

.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
the
heavens
open
;
and
an
angel
came
down
and
stood
before
me
;
and
he
said
unto
me
,
Nephi
,
what
beholdest

thou
?
And
I
said
unto
him
,
a
virgin
,
most
beautiful
and
fair
above
all
other
virgins
.
And
-
he
said
unto
me
,
knowest
thou
the
condescension
of
God
?
And
I
said
unto
him
,
J
know
that
-
he
loveth
his
children
;
nevertheless
,
Ido
not
know
the
meaning
of
all
things
.
And
he
said
unto
me
,
behold
,.
the
virgin
whom
thou
seest
,
is
the
mother
of
the
Son
of
God
,
after
.
the
manner
of
the
esh
,
?
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
that
she
was
carried
away
in
the
spirit
;
and
after
she
had
been
carried
away
in
the
spirit
for
the
.
space
of
a
time
,
.
the
angel
spake
unto
:
me
,
saying
,
look
!
And
I
looked
and
beheld
the
virgin
again
,
beazing
a
child
in
.
her
arms
..
And
the
angel
said
.
unto
me
,
behald
the
Lamb
of
God
,
[File:026]
yea
,
even
the
Son
of
the
Eternal
Father
!
_Knowest
thou
the
meaning
of
the
tree
which
thy
fathersaw
?
AndI
answered
him
,
saying
,
yea
,
it
is
the
love
of
God
,
which
sheddeth
itself
abroad
in
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
;
wherefore
,
it
is
the
most
desirable
above
all
things
.
And
he
spake
unto
me
,
saying
,
yea
,
and
the
most
joyous
to
the
soul
.
And
after
he
had
said
these
words
,
he
said
unto
me
,
look
!
And
[I
looked
,
and
I
beheld
the
Son
of
God
going
forth
among
the
children
of
men
;
and
I
saw
many
fall
down
at
his
feet
and
wership
him
.
nd
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
that
the
rod
of
iron
which
my
father
had
seen
,
was
the
word
of
God
,
which
led
to
the
fountain
of
living
waters
,
or
4o
the
tree
of
life
;
which
waters
are
a
representation
of
the
love
of
God
;
and
I
also
beheld
that
the
tree
of
life
was
a
representation
of
the
love
of
God
.
And
the
angel
said
unto
me
again
,
look
and
behold
the
condescension
of
God
!
And
I
looked
and
beheld
the
Redeemer
of
the
world
,
of
whom
my
father
had
spoken
;
and
I
also
beheld
the
prophet
,
who
should
prepare
the
way
before
him
.
And
the
Lamb
of
God
went
forth
and
was
baptised
of
him
;
and
after
he
was
baptised
,
I
beheld
the
heavens
open
,
and
the
Holy
Ghost
come
down
out
of
heaven
and
abode
upon
him
in
the
form
of
a
dove
..
And
I
beheld
that
he
went
forth
ministering
unto
the
people
,
in
power
and
great
glory
;
and
the
multitudes
were
gathered
together
to
hear
him
;
and
I
beheld
that
they
cast
him
out
from
among
them
.
And
[I
also
beheld
twelve
others
following
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
carried
away
in
the
spirit
,
from
before
my
face
and
I
saw
them
not
..
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
spake
unto
meagain
,
saying
,
look
!
And
I
looked
,
and
I
beheld
the
heavens
open
again
,
andl
saw
angels
descending
upon
the
children
of
men
;
and
they
did
minister
unto
them
..
And
he
spake
unto
me
again
,
saying
,
look
!
AndI
looked
,
and
I
beheld
the
Lamb
of
God
going
forth
among
the
children
of
men
.
And
I
beheld
multitudes
of
people
who
.
were
sick
,
and
who
were
afflicted
with
all
manner
of
diseases
,
and
with
devils
,
and
unclean
spirits
;
and
.
the
angel
spakey
and
shewed
all
these
ings
unto
me
.
And
they
were
healed
by
the
power
of
the
Lamb
of
God
;
and
the
devils
and
the
unclean
spirits
were
cast
out
.
~~
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
spake
unto
me
agai
,
saying
,
look
!
AndI
looked
and
:
beheld'
the
[File:027]
Lamb
of
God
,
that
he
was
taken
by
the
people
;
yea
,
the
Son
of
the
everlasting
God
was
judged
of
the
world
;
and
I
saw
and
bear
record
.
And
I
,
Nephi
,
saw
that
he
was
lifted
up
upon
the
cross
,
and
slain
for
the
sins
of
the
world
.
And
after
he
was
slain
Isaw
the
multitudes
of
the
earth
,
that
they
were
gathered
together
to
fight
against
the
apostles
of
the
Lamb
;
for
thus
were
the
twelve
called
by
the
angel
of
the
Lord
.
And
the
multitude
of
the
earth
was
gathered
together
;
and
I
beheld
that
they
were
in
a
large
and
spacious
building
,
like
unto
the
building
which
my
father
saw
!
And
the
angel
of
the
Lord
spake
unto
me
again
,
saying
,
behold
the
world
and
the
wisdom
thereof
;
yea
,
behold
,
the
house
of
Israel
hath
gathered
together
,
to
fight
against
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
Lamb
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
and
bear
record
,
that
the
great
and
spacious
building
was
the
pride
of
the
world
;
and
it
fell
;
and
the
fall
thereof
was
exceeding
great
.
And
the
angel
of
the
Lord
spake
unto
me
again
,
saying
,
thus
shall
be
the
destruction
of
all
nations
,
kindreds
,
tongues
and
people
,
that
shall
fight
against
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
Lamb
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
said
unto
me
look
,
and
behold
thy
seed
,
and
also
the
seed
of
thy
brethren
!
And
J
looked
and
beheld
the
land
of
promise
;
and
I
beheld
multitudes
of
people
,
yea
,
even
as
it
were
in
number
,
as
many
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
multitudes
gathered
together
to
battle
,
one
against
the
other
;
and
I
beheld
wars
,
and
rumors
of
wars
,
and
great
slaughters
with
the
sword
among
my
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
[
beheld
many
generations
pass
away
,
after
the
manner
of
wars
and
contentions
in
the
land
;
and
I
beheld
many
cities
,
yea
,
even
that
I
did
not
number
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
a
mist
of
darkness
on
the
face
of
the
land
of
promise
;
and
I
saw
lightnings
,
and
I
heard
thunderings
,
and
earthquakes
,
and
all
manner
of
tumultuous
noises
;
and
I
saw
the
earth
and
the
rocks
that
they
rent
;
and
J
saw
mountains
tumbling
into
pieces
;
and
I
saw
the
plains
of
the
earth
,
that
they
were
broken
up
;
and
I
saw
many
cities
,
that
they
were
sunk
;
and
I
saw
many
that
they
were
burned
with
fire
;
and
I
saw
many
that
did
tunible
to
the
earth
,
because
of
the
quaking
thereof
.
'
And
it
came
to
pass
after
I
saw
these
things
;
I
saw
dhe
vapor
of
darkness
,
that
it
passed
from
off
the
face
[File:028]
of
the
earth
;
and
behold
,
I
saw
multitudes
who
had
fallen
,
because
of
the
great
and
terrible
judgments
of
the
Lord
.
.
And
I
saw
the
lieavens
open
,
and
the
Lamb
of
God
descending
out
of
heaven
;
and
he
came
down
and
shewed
himself
unto
them
.
And
I
also
saw
and
bear
record
,
that
the
Holy
Ghost
fell
upon
twelve
others
;
aud
they
were
ordained
of
God
,
and
chosen
.
And
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
,
behold
the
twelve
disciples
of
the
Lamb
,
who
are
chcsen
to
minister
unto
thy
seed
.
And
he
said
unto
me
,
thou
:
remembereth
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
Lamb
?
Behold
they
are
they
who
shall
judge
the
twelve
tribes

wherefore

the
house
of
Israel

and
these
twelve
ministers

thou
beholdest

judge
thy
seed

And
behold
they
are
righteous
forever
;
for
because
of
their
faith
in
the
Lamb
of
God
,
their
garments
are
made
white
in
his
blood
.
And
the
angel
said
unto
me
,
look
!
And
1
looked
and
beheld
three
generations
pass
away
in
righteousness
;
and
their
garments
were
white
,
even
lke
unto

And
the

said
unto
me
,
these

in
the
blood

the
Lamb
,
because
of
their
faith

And
I
,
Nephi
,
also
saw
many
of
the
fourth
generation
,
who
passed
away
in
righteousness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
the
multitudes
of
the
earth
gathered
together
.
And
the
angel
said
unto
me
,

And

against

they
were

And
,
the
angel
spake
unto
me
,
saying
,
behold
the
fountain
of
filthy
water
which'thy

saw
;
yea
,
even
the
river
of
which
he

;
and
the
depths
thereof
are
the
depths
of

;
and
the

that
they
may
perish

and
are
lost
;
and
the
large
and
spacious
building
which

-
and
from

timehenceforth
and
forever
.
And
while
the
angel
spake
these
words
,
I
beheld
and
saw
that
the
seed
of
my
brethren
did
contend
against
my
seed
,
according
to
the
word
of
the'
angel
;
and
because
of
the
pride
of
my
seed
,
and
the
temptations
of
the
devil
,
I
beheld
that
the
seed
of
my
brethren
did
overpower
the
people
of
my
seed
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
and
saw
the
people
of
the
seed
of
my
brethren
,
that
they
had
overcome
my
seed
;
and
they
went
forth
in
multitudes
upon
the
face
of
the
land
.
And
I
saw
them
gathered
together
in
multitudes
;
and
I
saw
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
among
them
;
and
in
wars
,
and
rumors
of
wars
,
1
saw
many
generations
pass
away
.
And
the
angel
said
unto
me
,
behold
,
these
shall
dwindle
in
unbelief
.
And
it
carne
to
pass
that
I
beheld
after
they
had
dwindled
in
unbelief
,
they
became
a
dark
and
loathsome
,
anda
filthy
people
,
full
of
idleness
and
all

of
abominations
.
And
it
came
to

that
the
angel
spake
unto
me
saying
,

And
I
looked
and
beheld
many

And
the

said
unto

And
I
said
I

And
he
said
unto
me
,

the
nae

And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
saw
among
the
nations
of
the
Gentiles
the
foundation
of
a
:
great
church
.
And
the
angel
said
unto
me
,
behold
the
foundation
of
a
church
,
which
is
most
abominable
above

which
slayeth

and
tortureth
them

bindeth
them
down
,
and
yoketh
them
with
a
yoke
of
iron
,
and
bringeth
them
down
into
captivity
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
this
great
and
abominable
church
;
and
I
saw
the
devil
that
he
was
the
foundation
of
it
.
And
I
also
saw
gold
,
and'silver
,
and
silks
,
and
scarlets
,
and
fine

linen
,
'
and
all

And
the
angel
spake
unto
me
,
saying
,
behold

and
:
the
scarlets
,
and
the

,
and
the
precious

are
the
desires
of
this
great

abominable
church
:
and
also
for
the
praise
of
the
world
,
do
they
destroy
the
saints
of
God
,
and
bring
them
down
into
captivity
.
And
it
came'
to'pass
that
I
looked
and
beheld
many
waters
;
and
they
divided
the
Gentiles
from
the
seed
[File:030]
of
my
brethren
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
said
unto
me
,
behold
the
wrath
of
God
is
upon
the
seed
of
thy
brethren
!
And
I
looked
and
beheld
a
man
among
the
Gentiles
,
who
was
separated
from
the
seed
of
my
brethren
by
the
many
waters
;
and
I
beheld
the
spirit
of
God
,
that
it
came
down
and
wrought
upon
the
man
;
and
he
went
forth
upon
the
many
waters
,
even
unto
the
seed
of
my
brethren
,
who
were
in
the
promised
land
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
the
spirit
of
God
,
that
it
wrought
upon
other
Gentiles
;
and
they
went
forth
out
of
captivity
,
upon
tae
many
waters
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
1
beheld
many
multitudes
of
the
Gentiles
,
upon
the
land
of
promise
;
and
I
beheld
the
wrath
of
God
,
that
it
was
upon
the
seed
of
my
brethren
;
and
they
were
scattered
before
the
Gentiles
,
and
were
smitten
.
And
I
beheld
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
,
that
it
was
upon
the
Gentiles
;
that
they
did
prosper
,
and
obtain
the
land
for
their
inheritance
;
and
I
beheld
that
they
were
white
,
and
exceeding
fair
and
beautiful
,
like
unto
my
people
,
before
they
were
slain
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
beheld
that
the
Gentiles
who
had
gone
forth
out
of
captivity
,
did
humble
themselves
before
the
Lord
;
and
the
power
of
the
Lord
was
with
them
;
and
I
beheld
that
their
mother
Gentiles
were
gathered
together
upon
the
waters
,
and
upon
the
land
also
,
to
battle
against
them
;
and
I
beheld
that
the
power
of
God
was
with
them
;
and
also
that
the
wrath
of
God
was
upon
all
those
that
were
gathered
together
against
them
to
battle
.
And
I
,
Nephi
,
beheld
that
the
Gentiles
that
had
gone
out
of
cap
tivity
,
were
delivered
by
the
power
of
God
,
out
of
the
hands
of
all
other
nations
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
beheld
that
they
did
prosper
in
the
land
;
and
I
beheld
a
book
,
and
it
was
carried
forth
among
them
.
And
the
angel
said
unto
me
,
knowest
thou
the
meaning
of
the
book
?.
And
I
said
unto
him
,
I
know
not
.
And
he
said
,
behold
,
it
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
Jew
:
and
I
,
Nephi
,
beheld
it
;
and
he
said
unto
me
,
the
book
that
thou
beholdest
,
is
a
record
of
the
Jews
,
which
contains
the
covenants
of
the
Lord
which
he
hath
made
unto
_
the
house
of
Israel
;
and
it
also
containeth
mang
of
the
prophecies
of
the
holy
prophets
;
and
it
is
a
record
like
unto
the
engravings
which
are
upon
the
plates
of
brags
,
save
there
are
not
so
many
;
nevertheless
,
they
contain
the
covenants
of
the
Lewd
,
which
he
hath
[File:031]
made
unto
the
house
of
Israel
;
wherefore
,
they
are
of
great
worth
unto
the
Gentiles
.
And
the
angel
of
the
Lord
said
unto
me
,
thou
hast
beheld
that
the
book
proceeded
forth
,
from
the
mouth
of
a
Jew
;
and
when
it
proceeded
forth
from
the
mouth
of
a
Jew
,
it
contained
the
plainness
of
the
gospel
of
the
Lord
,
of
whom
the
twelve
apostles
bear
record
;
and
they
bear
record
according
to
the
truth
which
is
in
the
Lamb
of
God
;
wherefore
,
these
things
go
forth
from
the
Jews
:
in
purity
,
unto
the
Gentiles
,
aconreae
to
the
truth
which
is
in
God
;
and
after
they
go
for
by
the
hand
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
Lamb
,
from
the
Jews
unto
the
Gentiles
,
thou
seest
the
foundation
of
a
great
and
abominable
church
,
which
is
most
abominable
above
all
other
churches
;
for
behold
,
they
have
taken
away
from
the
gospel
of
the
Lamb
,
many
parts
which
are
plain
and
most
precious
;
and
also
many
covenants
of
the
Lord
have
they
taken
away
;
and
all
this
have
they
done
,
that
they
might
pervert
the
right
ways
of
the
Lord
;
that
they
might
blind
the
eyes
and
harden
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
:
wherefore
,
thou
seest
that
after
the
book
hath
gone
forth
through
the
hands
of
the
great
and
abominable
church
,
that
there
are
many
plain
and
precious
things
taken
awa
from
the
book
,
which
is
the
book
of
the
Lamb
of
God
;
and
after
these
plain
and
precious
things
were
taken
away
,
it
goeth
forth
unto
all
the
nations
of
the
Gentiles
;
and
after
it
goeth
forth
unto
all
the
nations
of
the
Gentiles
,
yea
,
even
across
the
many
waters
which
thou
hast
seen
with
the
Gentiles
which
have
gone
forth
out
ofcaptivity
;
thou
seest
because
of
the
many
plain
and
precious
things
which
have
been
taken
out
of
the
book
,
which
were
plain
unto
the
understanding
of
the
children
of
men
,
according
to
the
plainness
which
is
in
the
Lamb
of
God
;
because
of
these
things
which
are
taken
away
out
of
the
gospel
of
the
Lamb
,
an
exceedi
great
many
do
stumble
,
yea
,
insomuch
that
satan
hath
great
power
over
them
;
nevertheless
thou
belholdest
that
the
Gentiles
who
have
gone
forth
out
of
captivity
,
and
have
been
lifted
up
by
the
power
of
God
above
all
other
nations
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
which
is
choice
above
all
other
lands
,
which
is
the
land
that
the
Lord
God
hath
covenanted
with
thy
father
,
that
his
seed
should
have
,
for
the
land
of
their
inheritance
,
will
not
utterly
destroy
the
mixture
of
thy
seed
,
which
are
among
thy
brethren
;
neither
will
he
suffer
that
the
Gentiles
shall
destroy
the
seed
of
thy
brethren
;
neither
will
[File:032]
the
Lord
God
suffer
that
the
Gentiles
shall
forever
remain
inthatawful
state
ofblindness
,
which
thou
beholdest
they
are
in
,
because
of
the
plain
and
most
precious
parts
of
the
gospel
of
the
Lamb
which
have
been
kept
back
by
that
abominablechurch
,
whose
formation
thou
hast
seen
.
Wherefore
,
saith
the
Lamb
of
God
,

will
be
merciful
unto
the
Gentiles
,
unto
the
visiting
of
the
remnant

house
of
Israel
in
great
judgment
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
of
the
Lord
spake
unto
me
,
saying

and
this
remnant

I
speak

wherefore

after
I
have
visited
them
in
judgment
,
and
smitten
them
by
the
hand
of
the
Gentiles
;
and
after

Gentiles
do
stumble
exceedingly

of

I

day

insomuch
that
I
will
bring
forth
unto
them
in
mine
own
power

much
of
my
gospel

which
shall
be
plain

saith

{
will
manifest
myself
unto

And
it
came
to

that
I
beheld
the
remnant

also
the
book
of
the

of

,
which
had

that
it

after

had
come

I

beheld
other

which
came
forth
by

power

from

unto
the

also
[File:033]
the
Jews
,
who
were
scattered
upon

all
the

earth
,
that
the
records
of
the
prophets
and
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
Lamb
,
are
true
.
And
the
angel
spake
unte
me
,
saying
,
these
last
records
which
thou
hast
seen
among

Gentiles
,
shall
establish
the
truth
of

first
,
which
are
of

have
been

away
from
them
;
and
shall
make
known
to
all
kindreds

people
,
that
.
the
Lamb
of
God
is
the
Son
of
the
eternal
Father

and
the
Savior
of
the
world
;
and
that
.
all
men
must_come
unto
him
,
or
they
cannot
be
saved
;
and
they
must
come
according
to
the
words
which
shall
be
established
by
the
mouth
of
the
Lamb
:
and
the
words'of
the
Lamb
shall
be
made
known
in
the
reeords
of
thy
seed
,
as
well
as
in
the
records
of

of
the

;
wherefore
,
they
both
shall
be

established

one
;
for
there
is
one
God
and
one
Shepherd
over
all
the
earth
;
and
the
time
cometh
that
he
shall
manifest
himself
unto
all
nations
,
both
unto

Jews
,
and
also
unto
the
Gentiles
;
and
after
he
has
manifested
himself
unto
the
Jews

also
unto

hearken
unto

day
that
he
shall
manifest
himself
unto
them
in
word
,

also
in
power

in
very
deed
,
unto
the
taking
away
of
their
stumbling
blocks
,

not
their
hearts
against
the
Lamb
of

they

thy

,
they
shall
be
numbered
among
the
house
of
Israel

they
shall
be
a
blessed
peopleupon
the
promised
land
forever
;
they
shall
be
no
more
brought
down
into
captivity
;
and
the
house
of
Israelshall
no
more
be
confounded
;
and
that
great
pit
which
hath
been
digged
for
them
,
by
that
great
and
abominable
church
,
which
was
founded
by
the
devil
and
his
children
,
that
he
might
lead
away
the
souls
of
men
down
to
hell
;
yea
,
that
great
pit
which
hath
been
digged
for
the
destruction
of
men
,
shall
be
filled
by
those
who
digged
it
,
unto
their
utter
destruction
,
saith
the
Lamb
of
God
;
not
the
destruction
of
the
soul
,
save
it
be
.
the
casting
of
it
into
that
:
hell
which
hath'no
end
;
for
behold
,
this
.
is
according
to
the
captivity
:
of
the
devil
,
and
algo
according
to
the
[File:034]
justice
of
God
,
upon
all
those
who
will
work
wickedness
and
abomination
before
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
spake
unto
me
,
Nephi
,
saying
,
thou
hast
beheld
that
if
the
Gentiles
repent
,
it
shall
be
well
with
them
;
and
thou
also
knowest
concerning
the
covenants
of
the
Lord
unto
the
house
of
Israel
;
and
thou
also
hast
heard
,
that
whoso
repenteth
not
,
must
perish
;
therefore
,
wo
be
unto
the
Gentiles
,
if
it
so
be
that
they
harden
their
hearts
against
the
Lamb
of
God
;
for
the
time
cometh
,
saith
the
Lamb
of
God
,
that
I
wi
!
l
work
a
great
and
a
marvellous
work
among
the
children
of
men
;
a
work
which
shall
be
everlasting
,
either
on
the
one
hand
or
on
the
other
:
either
to
the
convincing
of
them
unto
peace
and
life
eternal
,
or
unto
the
deliverance
of
them
to
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
the
blindness
of
their
minds
,
unto
their
being
brought
down
into
captivity
,
and
also
unto
destruction
,
both
temporally
and
spiritually
,
according
to
the
captivity
of
the
devil
,
of
which
I
have
spoken
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
angel
had
spoken
these
words
,
he
said
unto
me
,
remember
thou
the
covenants
of
the
Father
unto
the
house
of
Israel
?
I
said
unto
him
,
yea
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
me
,
look
,
and
behold
that
great
and
abominable
ehurch
,
which
is
the
mother
of
abominations
,
whose
foundation
is
the
devil
.
-
And
he
said
unto
me
behold
,
there
are
,
save
two
churches
only
:
the
one
is
the
church
of
the
Lamb
of
God
,
and
the
other
is
the
church
of
the
devil
;
wherefore
,
whoso
belongeth
not
to
the
church
of
the
Lamb
of
God
,
belongeth
to
that
great
church
,
which
is
the
mother
of
abominations
;
and
she
is
the
whore
of
all
the
earth
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
looked
and
beheld
the
whore
of
all
the
earth
,
and
she
sat
upon
many
waters
;
and
she
had
dominion
over
all
the
-
earth
,
among
all
nations
,
kindreds
,
tongues
and
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
the
church
of
the
Lamb
of
God
,
and
its
numbers
were
few
,
because
of
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
the
whore
who
sat
upon
many
waters
;
nevertheless
,
I
beheld
that
the
church
of
the
Lamb
,
who
were
the
.
saints
of
God
,
were
also
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
;
and
their
dominions
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
were
small
,
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
great
whore
whom
I
saw
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
that
the
great
mother
of
abominations
did
gather
together
multitudes
[File:035]
upon
the
face
.
of
all
the
earth
,
amongall
the
nations
of
the
Gentiles
,
to
fight
against
the
Lamb
of
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
beheld
the
power
of
the
Lamb
of
God
,
that
it
descended
upon
the
saints
of
the
church
of
the
Lamb
,
and
upon
the
covenant
people
of
the
Lord
,
who
were
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
;
and
they
were
armed
with
righteousness
and
with
the
power
of
God
in
great
glory
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
that
the
wrath
of
God
was
poured
out
upon
the
.
great
and
abominable
church
,
insomuch
that
there
were
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
among
all
the
nations
and
kindreds
of
the
earth
,
and
as
there
began
to
be
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
among
all
the
.
nations
which
belonged
to
the
mother
of
abominations
,
the
angel
spake
unto
me
,
saying
,
behold
,
the
wrath
of
God
is
upon
the
mother
of
harlots
;
and
behold
,
thou
seest
all
these
things
:
and
when
the
day
cometh
that
the
wrath
of
God
is
poured
out
upen
the
mother
of
harlots
,
which
is
the
great
and
abominable
church
of
all
the
earth
,
whose
foundation
is
the
devil
,
then
,
at
that
day
,
the
work
of
the
Father
shall
commence
,
in
preparing
the
way
for
the
fulfilling
of
his
covenants
,
which
he
hath
made
to
his
people
,
who
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
angel
spake
unto
me
,
saying
,
look
!
And
I
looked
and
beheld
a
man
,
and
he
was
dressed
in
a
white
robe
;
and
the
angel
said
unto
me
,
behold
one
of
the
twelve
apostles
of
the
Lamb
!.
Behold
,
he
shall
see
and
write
the
remainder
of
these
things
;
yea
,
and
also
many
things
which
have
been
:
and
he
shall
also
write
concerning
the
end
of
the
world
;
wherefore
,
the
things
which
he
shall
write
,
are
just
and
true
;
and
behold
,
they
are
written
in
the
book
which
thou
beheld
proceeding
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
Jew
;
and
at
the
time
they
proceeded
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
Jew
,
or
,
at
the
time
the
book
proceeded
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
Jew
,
the
things
which
were
written
,
were
plain
and
pure
,
and
most
precious
,
and
easy
to
the
understanding
of
all
men
.
And
behold
,
the
things
which
this
apostle
of
the
Lamb
shall
write
,
are
many
things
which
thou
hast
seen
;
and
behold
,
the
remainder
shalt
thou
see
;
but
the
things
which
thou
shalt
see
hereafter
,
thou
shalt
not
write
;
for
the
Lord
God
hath
ordained
the
apostle
of
the
Lamb
of
God
,

And
also
others

have
been

he
shown
all
things

they
have
written
them
;
and
they

sealed
up

forth

[File:036]
purity
,
according
to
the
truth
which
is
in
the
Lamb
,
in
the
own
due
time
of
the
Lord
,.
unto
the
house
of
Israel
.
And
I
,
Nephi
,
heard
and
bear
record
,
that
the
name
of
the
apostle
of
the
Lamb
was
Juhn
,
according
to
the
word
of
the
angel
.
And
behold
,
I
,
Nephi
,
am
forbidden
that
[
should
write
the
remainder
of
the
things
which
I
saw
and
heard
;
wherefore
,
the
things
which
I
have
written
sufficeth
me
;
and]
have
not
written
but
a
small
part
of
the
things
which
I
saw
.
And
I
bear
record
,
that
1
saw
the
things
which
my
father
saw
,
and
the
angel
of
the
Lord
did
make
them
known
unto
me
.
And
now
I
make
an
end
of
speaking
concerning
the
things
which
saw
,
while
I
was
carried
away
in
the
spirit
;
and
if
all
the
things
which
I
saw
are
not
written
,
the
things
which
1
have
written
,
are
true
.
And
thus
itis

Amen

CHAPTER
IV
.
Axp
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
,
Nephi
,
had
been
carried
away
in
the
spirit
,
and
seen
all
these
things
,
Â£
returned
to
the
tent
of
my
father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beheld
my
brethren
,
and
they
were
disputing
one
with
another
,
concerning
the
things
which
iny
father
had
spoken
unto
them
;
for
he
truly
spake
many
great
things
unto
them
,
which
were
hard
to
be
understood
,
save
a
iman
should
inquire
of
the
Lord
;
,.
and
they
being
hard
in
their
hearts
,
therefore
they
did
not
look
unto
the
Lord
as
they
ought
.
And
now
I
,
Nephi
,
was
grieved
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
,
and
also
,
because
of
the
things
which
I
had
seen
,
and
knew
they
must
unavoidably
come
to
pass
,
because
of
the
great
wickedness
of
the
children
of
men
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
was
.
overcome
because
of
my
afflictions
,
for
considered
that
mine
atHictions
were
great
above
all
,
because
of
the
destructions
of
my
people
;
for
I
had
beheld
their
fall
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
had
received
strength
,
I
spake
unto
my
brethren
,
desiring
to
know
of
them
the
cause
of
their
disputations
.
And
they
said
,
behold
,
we
cannot
understand
the
words
which
.
our
-
father
hath
spoken
concerning
the
natural
branches
.
of
[File:037]
the
olive
tree
,
and
also
,
concerning
the
Gentiles
.
And
I
said
unto
them
,
have
ye
inquired
of
the
Lord
?
'
And
they
said
unto
me
,
we
have
not
;
for
the
Lord
maketh
no
such
thing
known
unto
us
.
Behold
,
I
said
unto
them
,
how
is
it
that
ye
donot
keep
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
?
'
How
is
it
that
ye
will
perish
,
becauseof
the
hardness
of
your
hearts
?
Do
ye
not
remember
the
things
which
the
Lord
hath
said
,
if
ye
will
not
harden
your
hearts
,
and
ask
me
in
faith
,
believing
that
ye
shall
receive
,
with
diligence
in
keeping
my
commandments
,
surely
,
these
things
shall
be
made
known
unto
you
!
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
the
house
of
Israel
was
compared
unto
an
olive
tree
,
by
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
which
was
in
our
fathers
;
and
behold
,
are
we
not
broken
off
from
the
house
of
Israel
;
and
are
we
not
a
branch
or
the
house
of
Israel
?
And
now
,
the
thing
which
our
father
meaneth
concerning
the
grafting
in
of
the
natural
branches
through
the
fulness
of
the
Gentiles
,
is
,
that
in
the
latter
days
,
when
our
seed
shall
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
,
yea
,
for
the
space
of
many
years
,
and
many
generations
,
after
the
Messiah
shall
be
manifested
in
body
unto
the
children
of
men
,
then
shall
the
fulness
of
the
gospel
of
the
Messiah
come
unto
the
Gentiles
,
and
from
the
Gentiles
unto
the
remnant
of
our
seed
;
and
at
that
day
,
shall
the
remnant
of
our
seed
know
that
they
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
,
and
that
they
are
the
covenant
people
of
the
Lord
;
and
then
shall
they
know
and
come
to
the
knowledge
of
their
forefathers
,
and
also
to
the
krfowledge
of
the
gospel
of
their
Redeemer
,
which
was
ministered
unto
their
fathers
by
him
;
wherefore
,
they
shall
come
to
the
knowledge
of
their
Redeemer
,
and
the
very
points
of
his
doctrine
,
that
they
may
know
how
to
come
unto
him
and
be
saved
.
And
then
at
that
day
,
will
they
not
rejoice
and
give
praise
unto
their
everlasting
God
,
their
rock
and
their
salvation
?
Yea
,
at
that
day
,
will
they
not
receive
the
strength
and
nourishment
from
the
true
vine
?
Yea
,
will
they
not
come
unto
the
tme
fold
of
God
?
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
yea
;
they
shall
be
remembered
again
among
the
house
of
Israel
;
they
shall
be
grafted
in
,
being
a
natural
branch
of
the
olive
tree
,
into
the
true
olive
tree
;
and
this
is
what
our
father
meaneth
;
and
he
meaneth
that
it
will
not
come
to
pass
,
until
after
they
are
scattered
by
the
Gentiles
;
and
he
meaneth
that
it
shall
come
by
way
of
the
Gentiles
,
that
the
Lord
may
shew
his
pow
[File:038]
er
unto
the
Gentiles
,
for
the
very
cause
that
he
shall
be
rejected
of
the
Jews
,
or
of
the
house
of
Israel
;
wherefore
,
our
father
hath
not
spoken
of
our
seed
alone
,
but
also
of
all
the
house
of
Israel
,
pointing
to
the
covenant
which
should
be
fulfilled
in
the
latter
days
;
which
covenant
the
Lord
made
to
our
father
Abraham
,
saying
,
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
he
blessed
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
spake
much
unto
them
concerning
these
things
;
yea
,
I
spake
unto
them
concerning
the
restoration
of
the
Jews
,
in
the
latter
days
;
and
I
did
rehearse
unto
them
the
words
of
Isaiah
,
who
spake
concerning
the
restoration
of
the
Jews
,
or
of
the
house
of
Israel
;
and
after
they
were
restored
,
they
should
no
more
be
confounded
,
neither
should
they
be
scattered
again
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
speak
many
words
unto
my
brethren
,
that
they
were
pacified
,
and
did
humble
themselves
before
the
Lord
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
speak
unto
me
again
,
saying
,
what
meaneth
this
thing
which
our
father
saw
ina
dream
?
What
meaneth
the
tree
which
he
saw
?
-
AndI
said
unto
them
,
it
was
a
representation
of
the
tree
of
life
.
And
they
said
unto
me
,
what
meaneth
the
rod
of
iron
which
our
father
saw
,
that
led
to
the
tree
?
And
I
said
unto
them
,
that
it
was
the
word
of
God
;
and
whoso
would
hearken
unto
the
word
of
God
,
and
would
hold
fast
unto
it
,
they
would
never
perish
;
neither
could
the
temptations
and
the
fiery
darts
of
the
adversary
,
overpower
them
unto
blindness
,
to
lead
them
away
to
destruction
.
Wherefore
,
I
Nephi
,
did
exhort
them
to
give
heed
unto
tha
word
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
I
did
exhort
them
with
all
the
energies
of
my
soul
,
and
with
all
the
faculty
which
I
possessed
,
that
they
would
give
heed
to
the
word
of
God
,
and
remember
to
keep
his
commandments
always
,
in
all
things
.
And
they
said
unto
me
,
what
meaneth
the
river
of
water
which
our
father
saw
?
And
1
said
unto
them
,
that
the
water
which
my
father
saw
,
was
filthiness
;
and
so
much
was
his
mind
swallowed
up
in
other
things
,
that
he
beheld
not
the
filthiness
of
the
water
;
and
f
eaid
unto
them
,
that
it
was
an
awful
gulf
,
which
separateth
the
wicked
from
the
tree
of
life
,
and
also
from
the
saints
of
God
.
And
I
said
unto
them
,
that
it
was
a
representation
of
that
awful
hell
,
which
the
eet
said
unto
me
was
prepared
for
.
the
wicked
.
And
I
said
unto
them
,
that
our
father
also
[File:039]
saw
,
that
the
justice
of
God
did
also
divide
the
wicked
from
the
righteous
;
and
the
brightness
thereof
was
like
unto
the
brightness
of
a
flaming
fire
,
which
ascendeth
up
unto
God
forever
and
ever
,
and
bath
no
end
.
And
they
said
unto
me
,
doth
this
thing
mean
the
torment
of
the
body
in
the
days
of
probation
,
or
doth
it
mean
the
final
state
of
the
soul
after
the
death
of
the
temporal
body
?
or
doth
it
speak
of
the
things
which
are
temporal
?
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
said
unto
them
,
that
it
was
a
representation
of
things
both
temporal
and
spiritual
;
for
the
day
should
come
that
they
must
be
judged
of
their
works
,
yea
,
even
the
works
which
were
done
by
the
temporal
body
in
their
days
of
probation
:
wherefore
,
if
they
should
die
in
their
wickedness
,
they
must
be
cast
off
also
,
as
to
the
things
which
are
spiritual
,
which
are
pertaining
to
righteousness
;
wherefore
,
they
must
be
brought
to
stand
before
God
,
to
be
judged
of
their
works
;
and
if
their
works
have
been
filthiness
,
they
must
needs
be
filthy
;
and
if
they
be
filthy
,
it
must
needs
be
that
they
cannot
dwell
in
the
kingdom
of
God
;
ifso
,
the
kingdom
of
God
must
be
filthy
also
,
But
behold
,
I
say
x
unto
you
,
the
kingdom
of
God
is
not
filthy
,
and
there
<
cannot
any
unclean
thing
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
God
;
wherefore
there
must
needs
be
a
place
of
filthiness
prepared
for
that
which
is
filthy
.
And
there
isa
pe
prepared
,
yea
,
even
that
awful
hell
of
which
I
ave
spoken
,
and
the
devil
is
the
foundation
of
it
;
wherefore
,
the
final
state
of
the
souls
of
mem
is
:
to
dwell
in
the
kingdom
of
God
,
or
to
be
east
out
hecause
of
that
justice
of
which
I
have
spoken
;
wherefore
,
the
wicked
are
rejected
from
the
righteous
,
and
also
from
that
tree
of
life
,
whose
fruit
is
most
preciousand
most
desirable
above
all
other
fruits
;
yea
,
and
it
is
the
great
est
of
all
the
gifts
of
God
.
And
thus
I
spake
unto
my
brethren
.
Amen
.
..
CHAPTER
V
.
Asp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
,
Nephi
,
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
to
my
.
brethren
,
behold
,
they
[File:040]
said
unto
me
,
thou
hast
declared
unto
us
hard
things
,
more
than
we
are
able
to
bear
.
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
said
unto
them
,
that
I
knew
that
I
had
spoken
hard
things
against
the
wicked
,
according
to
the
truth
;
and
the
righteous
have
I
justified
,
and
testified
that
they
should
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
;
wherefore
,
the
guilty
taketh
the
truth
to
be
hard
,
for
it
cutteth
them
to
the
very
center
.
And
now
,
my
brethren
,
if
ye
were
righteous
,
and
were
willing
to
hearken
to
the
truth
,
and
give
heed
unto
it
,
that
ye
might
walk
uprightly
before
God
,
then
ye
sraald
nol
murmur
because
of
the
truth
,
and
say
thou
speakest
hard
things
against
us
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
exhort
my
brethren
,
with
all
diligence
,
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
humble
themselves
before
the
Lord
;
insomuch
,
that
I
had
joy
and
great
hopes
of
them
,
that
they
would
walk
in
the
paths
of
righteousness
,
Now
,
all
these
things
were
said
and
done
,
as
my
father
dwelt
in
a
tent
in
the
valley
which
he
called
Lemuel
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
took
one
of
the
daughters
of
Ishmael
to
wife
;
and
also
,
my
brethren
took
of
the
daughters
of
Ishmael
to
wife
;
and
also
,
Zoram
took
the
eldest
daughter
of
Ishmael
to
wife
.
And
thus
my
father
had
.
fulfilled
all
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
which
had
been
given
unto
him
..
And
also
,
I
,
Nephi
,
had
been
blessed
of
the
Lord
exceedingly
.
And
it
@ame
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
Lord
spake
unto
my
father
,
by
night
,
and
commanded
him
,
that
on
the
morrow
,
he
should
take
his
journey
into
the
wilderness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
my
father
arose
in
the
morning
,
and
went
forth
to
the
tent
door
,
to
his
great
astonishment
,
he
beheld
upon
the
ground
around
ball
,
of
curious
workmanship
;
and
it
was
of
fine
brass
.
And
within
the
ball
were
two
spindles
;
and
the
one
pointed
the
way
whither
we
should
gointo
the
wilderness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
gather
together
whatsoever
things
we
should
carry
into
the
wilderness
,
and
all
the
remainder
of
our
provisions
whieh
the
Lord
had
given
unto
us
;
and
we
did
take
seed
of
every
kind
,
that
we
might
carry
into
the
wilderness
.
,
/ind
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
take
our
tents
,
and
depart
into
the
wilderness
,
across
the
river
Laman
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
travelled
for
the
space
of
[File:041]
four
days
,
nearly
a
south
,
southeast
direction
,
and
we
did
pitch
our
tents
again
;
and
we
did
call
the
name
.
of
the
place
Shazer
.
And
it
came
1o
pass
that
we
did
take
our
bows
and
our
arrows
,
and
go
forth
into
the
wilderness
,
to
slay
food
for
our
families
;
and
after
we
had
slain
food
for
our
families
,
we
did
return
again
to
our
families
in
the
wilderness
,
to
the
place
of
Shazer
.
And
we
did
go
forth
again
,
in
the
wilderness
,
following
the
same
direction
,
keeping
in
the
most
fertile
parts
of
the
wilderness
,
which
were
in
the
borders
near
the
Red
Sea
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
travel
for
the
space
of
many
days
,
slaying
food
by
the
way
,
with
our
bows
and
our
arrows
,
and
our
stones
and
our
slings
;
and
we
did
follow
the
directions
of
the
bail
,
which
led
us
in
the
more
fertile
parts
of
the
wilderness
.
And
after
we
had
travelled
for
the
space
of
many
days
,
we
did
pitch
our
tents
for
the
space
of
a
time
,
that
we
might
again
rest
ourselves
and
obtain
food
for
our
families
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
I
,
Nephi
,
went
forth
to
slay
food
,
behold
,
I
did
break
my
bow
,
which
was
made
of
fine
steel
;
and
after
I
did
break
my
bow
,
behold
,
my
brethren
were
angry
with
me
,
because
of
the
loss
of
my
bow
,
for
we
did
obtain
no
,
food
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
return
without
food
to
our
families
.
And
being
much
fatigued
,
because
of
their
journeying
,
they
did
suffer
much
for
the
want
of
food
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Laman
and
Lemuel
,
and
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
did
begin
to
murmur
exceedingly
,
because
of
their
sufferings
and
afflictions
in
the
walderness
;
and
also
my
father
began
to
murmur
against
the
Lord
his
God
;
yea
,
and
they
were
all
exceeding
sorrowful
,
even
that
they
did
murinuragainst
the
Lord
,
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
having
been
afflicted
with
my
brethren
,
because
of
.
the
loss
of
my
bow
;
and
their
bows
.
having
lost
their
springs
,
it
began
to
be
exeeeding
difficult
,
yea
,
insomuch
,
that
we
could
obtain
no
food
.
And
it
came
.
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
speak
much
unto
my
brethren
,
because
they
had
hardened
their
hearts
again
,
even
unto
complaining
against
the
Lord
their
God
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
make
out
of
wood
a
.
bow
,.
and
out
of
a
straight
stick
,
an
arrow
;
wherefore
,
I
did
arm
myself
with
a
bow
and
an
arrow
,
with
a
sling
,
and
with
stones
.
And
I
said
unto
my
father
,
whither
shall
Igo
,
to
obtain
food
?
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
inquire
of
the
Lord
,
for
they
[File:042]
had
humbled
themselves
because
of
my
word
:
for
I
did
say
many
things
unto
them
in
the
energy
of
my
soul
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
Lord
came
unto
my
father
;
and
he
was
truly
chastened
because
of
his
murmuring
against
the
Lord
,
insomuch
that
he
was
brought
down
into
the
depths
of
sorrow
.
..
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
Lord
said
unto
him
,
look
upon
the
ball
,
and
behold
the
things
which
are
written
!
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
beheld
the
things
which
were
written
upon
the
ball
,
he
did
fear
and
tremble
exceedingly
;
and
also
my
brethren
,
and
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
and
our
wives
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
beheld
the
pointers
which
were
in
the
ball
,
that
they
did
work
according
to
the
faith
,
and
diligence
,
and
heed
,
which
we
did
give
unto
them
.
And
there
was
also
written
upon
them
,
a
new
writing
,
which
was
plain
to
be
read
,
which
did
give
us
understanding
concerning
the
ways
of
the
Lord
;
and
it
was
written
and
changed
from
time
to
time
,
according
to
the
faith
and
diligence
which
we
gave
unto
it
:
And
thus
we
see
,
that
by
small
means
,
the
Lord
can
bring
about
great
things
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
go
forth
up
into
the
top
of
the
mountain
,
according
to
the
directions
which
were
given
upon
the
ball
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
slay
wild
beasts
;
insomuch
that
I
did
obtain
food
for
our
families
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
i
did
return
to
our
tents
,
bearing
the
beasts
which
I
had
slain
;
and
now
,
when
they
beheld
that
I
had
obtained
food
,
how
great
was
their
joy
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
humble
themselves
before
the
Lord
,
and
did
give
thanks
unto
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
again
take
our
journey
,
travelling
nearly
the
same
course
ag
in
the
eginning
:
and
after
we
had
travelled
for
the
space
ot
many
days
,
we
did
pitch
our
tents
again
,
that
we
raight
tarry
for
the
space
of
a
time
.
nd
it
came
to
pass
that
Ishmael
died
,
and
was
buried
in
the
place
which
was
called
Nahom
.
And
-
it
came
to
pass
that
the
daughters
of
Ishmael
did
mourn
exceedingly
,
because
of
the
loss
of
their
father
,
and
because
of
their
afflictions
in
:
the
wilderness
;
and
they
did
murmur
against
my
father
,
because
he
had
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
saying
,
our
father
is
dead
;
yea
,
and
we
have
wandered
much
in
the
wild
:
erness
,
and
we
have
suffered
much
affliction
,
hanger
;
[File:043]
thirst
,
and
fatigue
;
and
after
all
these
sufferings
,
we
must
perish
in
the
wilderness
with
hunger
.
And
thus
they
did
murmur
against
my
father
,
and
also
against
me
;
and
they
were
desirous
to
return
again
to
JerusaJem
:
And
Laman
said
unto
Lemuel
,
and
also
unto
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
behold
,
let
us
slay
our
father
,
and
also
our
brother
Nephi
,
who
has
taken
it
upon
him
to
be
our
ruler
and
our
teacher
,
who
are
his
elder
brethren
:
Now
,
he
says
that
the
Lord
bas
talked
with
him
,
and
alao
,
that
angels
have
ministered
unto
him
?
But
behold
,
we
know
that
he
lies
unto
us
;
and
.
he
tells
us
these
things
,
and
he
worketh
many
things
by
his
cunning
arts
,
that
he
may
deceive
our
eyes
,
thinking
,
perhaps
,
that
he
may
lead
us
away
into
some
strange
wilderness
;
and
after
he
has
led
us
away
,
he
has
Â©
thought
to
make
himself
a
king
and
a
ruler
over
us
,
that
he
may
do
with
us
according
to
his
will
and
leasure
.
And
after
this
manner
,
did
my
brother
Laan
stir
up
their
hearts
to
anger
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
was
with
us
;.
yea
,
even
the
voice
of
the
Lord
came
and
did
speak
many
words
unto
them
,
and
did
chasten
them
exceedingly
;
and
after
they
were
chastened
by
the
voice
of
the
Lord
,
they
did
turn
away
their
anger
,
and
did
repent
of
their
sins
,
insomuch
that
the
Lord
did
bless
.
us
again
with
food
,
that
we
did
not
perish
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
again
take
our
journey
in
the
wilderness
;
and
we
did
travel
nearly
eastward
,
from
that
time
forth
.
And
.
we
did
travel
and
wade
through
much
affliction
in
the
wilderness
;
and
our
women
did
bear
children
in
the
wilderness
.
And
so
great
were
the
blessings
of
the
Lord
upon
us
,
that
while
we
did
live
upon
raw
meat
in
the
wilderness
,
our
women
did
give
plenty
of
suck
for
their
children
,
and
were
strong
,
yea
,
even
like
unto
the
men
;
and
they
began
to
bear
their
journeyiugs
without
murmurings
.
And
thus
we
see
that
the
commandments
of
God
must
be
fulfilled
.
And
if
it
so
be
that
the
children
of
men
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
he
doth
nourish
them
,
and
strengthen
them
,
and
provide
means
whereby
they
can
accomplish
the
thing
whith
hehas
commanded
them
:
wherefore
,
he
did'
provide
means
for
us
while
we
did
sojourn
in
the'
wilderness
..
And
we
did
sojourn
for
the
space
of
many
years
,
yea
;
even
eight
years
in
the
wilderness
.
And
wwe
did'
come
to
the
land
which
we
called
Bountiful
,
because
of
its
much
fruit
,
and
also
-
wild'honey
;
and
all
these
things
[File:044]
were
prepated
of
the
Lord
,
that
-
we
might
not
perish
.
And
we
beheld
the
sea
,
which
we
called
Irreantum
,
which
being
interpreted
,
is
,
many
waters
.
And
it'came
to
pass
that
we
did
pitch
our
tents
by
the
seashore
;
and
-
notwithstanding
we
had
suffered
many
afflictions
,
and
much
difficulty
,
yea
,
even
so
much
that
we
cannot
write
them
all
,
we
were
exceedingly
rejoiced
when
we
came
to
the
seashore
;
and
we
called
tbe
place
Bountiful
,
because
of
its
much
fruit
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
,
Nephi
,
had
been
in
the
land
of
Bountiful
for
the
space
of
many
days
,
the
voice
of
the
Lord
came
unto
me
,
saying
,
arise
,
and
get
thee
into
the
mountain
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
E
arose
and
went
up
into
the
mountain
,
and
cried
unta
the
Lord
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
spake
unto
me
,
saying
,
thou
shalt
construct
a
ship
,
after
the
manner
which
I
shall
shew
thee
,
that
I
may
carry
thy
people
across
these
waters
.
And
I
said
,
Lord
,
whither
shall
I
go
,
that
I
may
find
ore
to
molten
,
that
1
may
make
tools
to
construct
the
ship
,
afler
the
manner
which
thou
hast
shewn
unto
me
?
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
told
me
whither
I
should
go
to
find
ore
,
that
I
might
make
tools
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
make
a
bellows
wherewith
to
blow
the
fire
,
of
the
skins
of
beasts
;
and
after
]
had
made
a
bellows
,
that
I
.
might
have
wherewith
to
blow
the
fire
,
1
did
smite
two
stones
together
,
that
I
might
make
fire
;
for
the
Lord
had
not
hitherto
suffered
that
we
should
make
much
fire
,
as
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
;
for
he
said
,
I
will
make
thy
food
become
sweet
,
that
ye
cook
it
not
;
and
I
will
also
be
your
light
in
the
wilderness
;
ahd
1
will
prepare
the
way
before
you
,
if
it
so
be
that
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
;
wherefore
,
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
shall
be
led
towards
the
promised
land
;
and
ye
shall
know
that
it
:
is
by
.
me
that
ye
are
led
.
'
Yea
,
andthe
Lord
said
also
,
that
after
ye
have
arrived
to
the
promised
land
,
ye
shall
know
that
1
,
the
Lord
,:
am
God
;
and
that
I
,
the
Lord
,
did
deliver
you
from
destruction
;
yea
,
that
1did
bring
you
out
of
the
.
land
of
Jerusalem
.
.
Wherefore
,
I
,
Nephi
,
did
strive
tokeep
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
,
and
I
.
did
exhort
,
my
brethren
to
faithfalness
and
diligence
.
:
evict
vas
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I'did
make
tools
ofthe
ore
which
I
did
molten
out
-
of
the
rock
.
And
):
when
my
[File:045]
brethren''saw
that
I
was
about
to'
build
a
ship
,
they
began
to
murmur
against
me
,
saying
,
our
brother
isa
.
fool
,
forhe
thinketh
that
he
ean
build
a
ship
:
yea
,
and
he
also'thinketh
that
he'can
cross
these
great
:
waters
.
And
thus
my
brethren
did
complain
against
me
,
and
were
desirous
that
they
might
not
labor
,
for
they
did
not
believe
that
I
could
build
a
ship
;
neither
would
they
believe
that
I
was
instructed
of
theLord
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
was
exceeding
sorrowful
,
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
;
and
now
when
they
saw
that
[
began
to
be
sorrowful
,
they
were
glad
in
their
hearts
,
insomuch
that
they
dia
rejoice
over
me
,
saying
,
we
knew
that
ye
could
not
construct
a
ship
,
for
we
knew
that
ye
were
lacking
in
judgement
;
wherefore
,
thou
canst
not
accomphsh
so
great
a
work
;
and
thou
art
lke
unto
our
father
,
led
away
by
the
foolish
imaginations
of
his
heart
;
yea
,
he
hath
led
us
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
;
and
we
have
wandered
in
the
wilderness
for
these
many
years
;
and
our
women
have
toiled
,
being
big
with
child
;
and
they
have
borne
children
in
the
wilderness
,
and
suffered
all
things
,
save
it
were
death
;
and
it
would
have
been
better
that
they
had
died
,
before
they
came
out
of
Jerusalem
,
than
to
have
suffered
these
afflictions
.
Behold
,
these
many
years
we
have
suffered
in
the
wilderness
,
which
time
we
might
have
enjoyed
our
possessions
,
and
the
land
of
our
inheritance
:
yea
,
and
we
might
have
been
happy
;.
and
we
know
that
the
people
who
were
inthe
land
of
Jerusalem
,
were
a
righteous
people
;
for
they
kept
the
statutes
and
the
judgements
of
the
Lord
,
and
all
his
commandments
,
according
to
the
law
of
Moses
;
wherefore
,
we
know
that
they
are
a
righteous
people
;
and
our
father
hath
judged
them
,
and
hath
led
us
away
because
we
would
hearken
unto
his
words
;
yea
,
and
our
brother
is
like
unto
him
.
And
after
this
manner
of
language
did
my
brethren
murmur
and
complain
against
us
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
spake
unto
them
,
saying
,
do
ye
believe
that
our
fathers
,
who
were
the
children
of
Israel
,
would
have
been
led
away
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Egyptians
,
if
they
had
not
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
the
Lord
?
Yea
,
do
ye
suppose
that
they
would
have
been
led
out
of
bondage
,
if
the
Lord
had
not
commanded
Moses
that
he
should
lead
them
out
of
bondaget
Now
ye
now
that
the
children
of
Israel
were
ih
bondage
;
and
ye
know
that
they
were
laden
With
tasks
,
which
were
grievous
to
be
borne
;
[File:046]
for
them
,
that
they
should
be
brought
out
of
bond
Now
ye
know
that
Moses
was
commanded
of
t
Lord
to
do
that
great
work
;
and
ye
know
that
by
his
word
,
the
waters
of
the
Red
Sea
were
divided
hither
and
thither
,
and
they
passed
through
on
dry
ground
.
But
ye
know
that
the
Egyptians
were
drowned
in
the
Red
Sea
,
who
were
the
armies
of
Pharaoh
;
and
ye
also
know
that
they
were
fed
with
manna
in
the
wilderness
;
yea
,
and
ye
also
know
that
Moses
,
by
his
word
,
according
to
the
power
of
God
which
was
in
him
,
smote
the
rock
,
and
there
came
forth
water
,
that
the
children
of
Israel
might
quench
their
thirst
;
and
notwithstanding
they
being
led
,
the
Lord
their
God
,
their
Redeemer
,
going
before
them
,
leading
them
by
day
,
and
giving
light
unto
them
by
night
,
and
doing
all
things
for
them
which
were
expedient
for
man
to
receive
,
they
hardened
their
hearts
,
and
blinded
their
minds
,
and
reviled
against
Moses
and
against
the
true
and
living
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
aceording
to
his
word
,
he
,
did
destroy
them
:
and
according
to
his
word
,
he
did
lead
them
;
and
according
to
his
word
,
he
did
do
all
things
for
them
;
and
there
was
not
any
thing
done
,
saye
it
were
by
his
word
.
And
after
they
had
crossed
the
river
Jordan
,
he
did
make
them
mighty
,
unto
the
.
driving
out
the
children
of
the
land
,
yea
,
unto
the
seattering
them
to
destruction
.
And
now
do
ye
suppose
that
the
children
of
this
land
,
who
were
in
the
land
of
promise
,
who
were
driven
out
by
our
fathers
,
do
ye
suppose
that
they
were
righteous
?
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
.
Do
ye
suppose
that
our
fathers
would
have
been
more
choice
than
they
,
if
they
had
been
righteous
?
I
say
unto
you
nay
;
behold
,
the
Lord
esteemeth
all
flesh
in
one
:
He
that
is
righteous
,
is
favored
of
God
.
But
behold
,
this
people
had
rejected
every
word
of
God
,
and
they
were
ripe
in
iniquity
;
and
the
fulness
of
the
wrath
of
.
God
was
upon
them
;
and
the
Lord
did
curse
the
land
against
them
,
and
bless
it
unto
our
fathers
;
yea
,
he
did
curse
it
against
them
unto
their
destruction
;
and
he
did
bless
it
unto
our
fathers
,
unto
their
obtaining
power
over
it
.
Behold
,
the
Lord
hath
created
the
earth
that
it
should
be
inhabited
;
and
he
hath
created
:
his
children
,
that
they
should
possess
.
it
.
And
he
raiseth
up
a
righteous
na~
tion
,
and
destroyeth
the
nations
of
the
wicked
.
And
he
leadeth
away
the
righteous
into
precious
lands
,
and
wherefore
,
ye
know
that
it
must
needs
be
a
good
thing
e
[File:047]
the
wicked
he
destroyeth
,
and
curseth
the
land
unto
them
for
their
sakes
.
He
ruleth
high
in
the
heavens
,
for
it
is
his
throne
,
and
this
earthis
his
footstool
.
And
he
loveth
those
who
will
have
him
to
be
their
God
.
Behold
,
he
loved
our
fathers
;
and
he
covenanted
with
them
,
yea
,
even
Abrahan
,
Isaac
,.
and
Jacob
:
and
he
remembered
the
covenants
which
he
had
made
;
wherefore
,
he
did
bring
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
,
and
he
did
straighten
them
in
the
wilderness
with
his
rod
,
for
they
hardened
their
hearts
,
even
as
ye
have
;
and
the
Lord
straightened
them
because
of
their
iniquity
.
He
sent
fiery
-
flying
serpents
among
them
;
and
after
they
were
bitten
,
he
prepared
a
way
that
they
might
be
healed
;
and
the
labor
which
they
had
to
perform
,
was
to
look
!
and
because
of
the
simpleness
of
the
way
,
or
the
easiness
of
it
,
there
were
many
who
perished
,
And
they
did
harden
their
hearts
from
time
to
time
,
and
they
did
revile
against
Moses
,
and
also
against
God
;
nevertheless
,
ye
know
that
they
were
led
forth
by
his
matchless
power
into
the
land
of
promise
.
And
now
,
after
all
these
things
,
the
time
has
come
that
they
have
become
wicked
,
yea
,
nearly
unto
ripeness
;
and
[
know
not
but
they
are
at
this
day
about
to
be
destroyed
;
for
I
know
that
the
day
must
surely
come
,
that
they
must
be
destroyed
,
save
a
few
antly
,
who
shall
be
led
away
into
captivity
;
wherefore
,.
the
Lord
commanded
my
father
that
he
should
depart
into
the
wilderness
;
and
the
Jews
also
sought
to
take
awa
his
life
;
yea
,
and
ye
also
have
sought
to
take
away
his
life
;
wherefore
,
ye
are
murderers
in
your
hearts
,
and
ye
are
like
unto
them
:
Ye
are
swift
to
do
iniquity
,
but
slow
to
remember
the
Lord
your
God
.
Ye
have
seen
an
angel
,
and
he
spake
unto
you
;
yea
,
ye
have
heard
his
voice
from
time
to
time
;
and
he
hath
spoken
unto
you
in
a
still
,
small
voice
,
but
ye
were
past
feeling
,
that
ye
could
not
feel
his
words
;
wherefore
,
he
has
spoken
unto
you
like
unto
the
voice
of
thunder
,
which
did
cause
the
earth
to
shake
as
if
it
were
to
divide
assunder
.
And
ye
also
know
,
that
by
the
power
of
his
almighty
word
,
he
can
cause
the
earth
that
it
shall
pass
away
;
per
and
ye
know
that
by
his
word
,
he
can
cause
the
rough
places
to
be
made
smooth
,
and
smooth
places
shall
be
broken
up
.
O
,
then
,
whi
is
it
,
that
ye
can
be
so
hard
in
your
hearts
?
Behold
,
my
sou
!
ig
rent
with
anguish
because
of
you
,
and
my
heart
is
pained
:
I
fearlest
ye
shall
be
cast'
off
forever
.

[File:048]
hold
,
I
am
full
of
the
spirit
of
God
,
insomuch
that
my
frame
has
no
strength
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
had
spoken
these
words
,
they
were
angry
with
me
,
and
were
desirous
to
throw
me
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
;
and
as
they
came
forth
to
lay
their
hands
upon
me
,
I
spake
unto
them
,
saying
,
in
the
name
of
the
Almighty
God
,
I
command
you
that
ye
touch
me
not
,
for
I
am
filled
with
the
power
of
God
,
even
unto
the
consuming
of
my
flesh
;
and
whoso
shall
lay
their
hands
upon
me
,
shall
wither
even
as
a
dried
reed
;
and
he
shall
be
as
nought
before
the
power
of
God
,
for
God
shall
smite
him
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
said
unto
them
,
that
they
should
murmur
no
more
against
their
father
;
neither
should
they
withhold
their
labor
from
me
,
for
God
had
commanded
me
that
I
should
build
a
ship
.
And
I
said
unto
them
,
if
God
had
commanded
me
to
do
all
things
,
I
could
dothem
.
If
he
should
command
me
that
I
should
say
unto
this
water
,
be
thou
earth
,
it
should
by
earth
;
and
if
I
should
say
it
,
it
would
be
done
.
And
now
,
if
the
Lord
has
such
great
power
,
and
has
wrought
so
many
miracles
among
the
children
of
men
,
how
is
it
that
he
cannot
instruct
me
,
that
I
should
build
a
ship
?
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
said
many
things
unto
my
brethren
,
insomuch
that
they
were
confounded
,
and
could
not
contend
against
me
;
neither
durst
they
lay
their
hands
upon
me
,
nor
touch
me
with
their
fingers
even
for
the
space
of
many
days
.
Now
they
durst
not
do
this
,
lest
they
should
wither
before
me
,
so
powerful
was
the
spirit
of
God
;
and
thus
it
had
wrought
upon
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
said
unto
me
,
stretch
forth
thine
hand
again
unto
thy
brethren
,
and
they
shall
not
wither
before
thee
,
but
I
will
shock
them
,
saith
the
Lord
and
this
will
Ido
,
that
they
may
know
that
I
am
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
stretched
forth
my
hand
unto
my
brethren
,
and
they
did
not
wither
before
me
;
but
the
Lord
did
shake
them
,
even
according
to
the
word
which
he
had
spoken
.
And
now
,
they
said
,
we
know
of
a
surety
,
that
the
Lord
is
with
thee
,
for
we
know
that
it
is
the
power
of
the
Lord
that
has
shaken
us
.
And
they
fell
down
before
me
,
and
were
about
.
to
worship
.
me
,
but
J
would
not
suffer
them
,
saying
,
Iam
thy
brother
,
yea
,
even
thy
younger
brother
;
where
[File:049]
fore
,
worship
the
Lord
thy
God
,
and
honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
,
that
thy
days
may
be
long
in
the
land
which
the
Lord
thy
God
shall
give
thee
.
_
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
worship
the
Lord
,
and
did
go
forth
with
me
;
and
we
did
work
timbers
of
curious
workmanship
.
And
the
Lord
did
shew
me
from
time
to
time
,
after
what
manner
I
should
work
the
timbers
of
the
ship
.
Now
I
,
Nephi
,
did
not
werk
the
timbers
after
the
manner
which
was
learned
by
men
,
neither
did
I
build
the
ship
after
the
manner
of
men
;
but
I
did
build
iit
after
the
manrer
which
the
Lord
had
shewn
unto
me
;
wherefore
,
it
was
not
after
the
manner
of
men
.
And
I
,
Nephi
,
did
go
into
the
mount
oft
,
and
I
did
pray
oft
unto
the
Lord
;
wherefore
,
the
Lord
shewed
unto
me
great
things
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
I
had
finished
the
ship
according
to
the
word
of
the
Lord
,
my
brethren
beheld
that
it
was
good
,
and
that
the
workmanship
thereof
was
exceeding
fine
;
wherefore
,
they
did
humble
themselves
again
before
the
Lord
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
Lord
came
unto
my
father
,
that
we
should
arise
and
go
down
into
the
ship
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
onthe
morrow
,
after
we
had
prepared
all
things
,
much
fruits
and
meat
from
the
wilderness
,
and
honey
in
abundance
,
and
provisions
,
according
to
that
which
the
Lord
had
commanded
us
,
we
did
go
down
into
the
ship
with
all
our
loading
and
our
seeds
,
and
whatsoever
thing
we
had
brought
with
us
,
every
one
occording
to
his
age
;
wherefore
,
we
did
all
ge
down
into
the
ship
,
with
our
wives
and
our
children
.
.
And
now
,
my
father
had
begat
two
sons
,
in
the
wilderness
:
The
eldest
was
called
Jacob
,
and
the
younger
,
Joseph
.
And
it
came
to
pass
after
we
had
all
gone
down
into
the
ship
,
and
had
taken
with
us
our
provisions
and
things
which
had
been
commanded
us
,
we
did
put
forth
into
the
sea
,
and
were
driven
forth
before
the
wind
,
towards
the
promised
land
;
and
after
we
had
been
driven
forth
before
the
wind
,
for
the
space
of
many
days
,
behold
my
brethren
,
and
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
and
also
their
wives
,
began
to
make
themselves
merry
,
insomuch
that
they
began
to
dance
,
and
to
sing
,
and
to
speak
with
muc
radehdid
,
yea
,
even
that
they
did
forget
by
what
power
they
had
been
brought
thither
;
yea
,
they
were
lifted
up
unto
exceeding
radeness
..
And
I
,
Nephi
,
began
to
fear
ex
[File:050]
ceedingly
,
lest
the
Lord
should
be
angry
with
us
,
and
smite
us
,
because
of
our
iniquity
,
that
we
should
be
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
;
wherefore
,
I
,
Nephi
,
began
to
speak
to
them
with
much
soberness
;
but
behold
,
they
were
angry
with
me
,
saying
,.
we
will
not
that
our
younger
brother
shall
be
a
ruler
over
us
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Laman
and
Lemuel
did
take
me
and
bind
me
with
cords
,
and
they
did
treat
me
with
much
harshness
;
nevertheless
,
the
Lord
did
suffer
it
,
that
he
might
shew
forth
his
power
,
unto
the
fulfilling
of
his
word
wich
he
had
spoken
,
concerning
the
wicked
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
afler
they
had
bound
me
,
insomuch
that
I
could
not
move
,
the
compass
,
which
had
been
prepared
of
the
Lord
,
did
cease
to
,
work
;
wherefore
,
they
knew
not
whither
they
should
gteer
the
ship
,
insomuch
,
that
there
arose
a
great
storm
,
yea
,
a
great
and
terrible
tempest
;
and
we
were
.
driven
back
upon
the
waters
for
the
space
of
three
days
;
and
they
began
to
be
frightened
exceedingly
,
lest
they
should
be
drowned
in
the
sea
:
nevertheless
,
they
did
not
loose
me
.
And
on
the
fourth
day
which
we
had
been
driven
back
,
the
tempest
began
to
be
exceeding
sore
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
were
about
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
.
And
after
we
had
been
driven
back
upon
the
waters
for
the
space
of
four
days
,
my
brethren
began
to
sec
that
the
judgements
of
God
were
upon
them
,
and
that
they
must
perish
,
save
that
they
should
repent
of
their
,
iniquities
;
wherefore
,
they
came
unto
me
and
loosed
.
the
bands
which
were
upon
my
wrists
,
and
behold
,
they
had
swollen
exceedingly
;
and
also
mine
anecles
were
much
swollen
,
and
reat
was
the
soreness
thereof
.
Nevertheless
,
I
did
ook
unto
my
.
God
,
and
I
did'
praise
him
all
the
day
long
;
and
I
did
not
murmur
against
the
Lord
,
because
of
mine
afflictions
.
Now
,
my
father
Lehi
,
had
said
many
things
unto
them
,.
and
also
unto
the
sons
of
Ishmael
;
but
Fehold
,
they
did
breathe
out
much
threatnings
against
any
one
that
should
speak
for
me
;
and
my
parents
being
stricken
in
years
,
and
having
suffered
much
grief
because
of
their
children
,
they
were
brought
down
,
yea
,
even
upon
their
sick
beds
.
Because
of
their
grief
,
and
much
sorrow
,
and
the
iniquity
of
my
brethren
,
they
were
brought
near
even
to
be
carried
out
of
this
time
,
to
meet
their
God
;
yea
,
their
.
grey
hairs
.
were
about
to
[File:051]
be
brought
down
to
lie
low
in
the
dust
;
yea
,
even
they
were
near
to
be
cast
into
the
watery
grave
.
And
Jacob
and
Joseph
also
,
being
young
,
'
having
need
of
much
nourishment
,
were
grieved
because
of
the
afflictions
of
their
mother
;
and
also
my
.
wife
,
with
her
tears
and
prayers
,
and
also
my
children
,
did
not
soften
the
hearts
of
my
brethren
,
that
they
would
loose
me
;
and
there
was
nothing
,
save
it
were
the
power
of
God
,
which
threatened
them
with
destruction
,
could
soften
their
hearts
;
wherefore
,
when
they
saw
that
they
were
about
to
be
swallowed
up
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
,
they
repented
of'thething
which
they
had
done
,
insomuch
thht
they
loosed
me
.
And
it
carne
to
pass
after
they
had
loosed
me
,
behold
,
I
took
the
compass
,
and
it
did
work
whither
I
desired
it
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
1
prayed
unto
the
Lord
;
and
after
I
had
prayed
,
the
winds
did
cease
,
and
the
storm
did
cease
,
and
there
was
a
great
calm
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
guide
the
ship
,
that
we
sailed
again
towards
the
promised
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
sailed
for
the
space
of
many
days
,
we
did
arrive
to
the
promised
land
;
and
we
went
forth
upon
the
land
,
and
did
pitch
our
tents
;
and
we
did
call
it
the
promised
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
begin
to
till
the
earth
,
and
we
began
to
plant
seeds
;
yea
,
we
did
put
all
our
seeds
into
the
earth
,
which
we
had
brought
from
the
land
of
Jerusalem
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
grow
exceedingly
;
wherefore
,
we
were
blessed
in
abundance
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
find
upon
the
land
of
promise
,
as
we
journeyed
in
the
wilderness
,
that
there
were
beasts
in
the
forests
of
every
kind
,
both
the
cow
,
and
the
ox
,
and
the
ass
,
and
the
horse
,
and
the
goat
,
and
the
wild
goat
,
and
all
manner
of
wild
animals
,
which
.
were
for
the
use
of
men
.
And
we
did
find
all
manner
of
ore
,
both
of
gold
,
and
of
silver
,
and
of
copper
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
commanded
me
,
wherefore
[
did
make
plates
of
ore
,
that
I
might
engraven
upon
them
the
record
of
my
people
.
And
upon
the
plates
which
I
made
,
I
did
engraven
the
record
of
my
father
,
and
also
our
journeyings
in
the
wilderness
,
and
the
prophecies
of
my
father
;
and
also
many
of
mine
own
prophecies
have
I
.
engraven
upon
them
.
And
I
:
knew
not
at
the
time
when
:
I
made
them
,
that
:
Ivshould
be
commanded
:
of
the
Lord'to
[File:052]
make
these
plates
;
wherefore
,
the
record
of
my
father
,
and
the
genealogy
of
his
fathers
,
and
the
more
part
of
all
our
proceedings
in
the
wilderness
,
are
engraven
upon
those
plates
of
which
I
have
spoken
;
wherefore
,
the
things
which
transpired
before
I
made
these
plates
,
are
,
of
a
truth
,
more
particularly
made
mention
upon
the
first
plates
.
And
after
I
had
made
these
plates
by
way
of
commandment
,
I
,
Nephi
,
received
a
commandment
,
that
the
ministry
,
and
the
prophecies
,
the
more
plain
and
precious
parts
of
them
should
be
written
upon
these
plates
;
and
that
the
things
which
were
written
,
should
be
kept
for
the
instruction
of
my
people
,
who
should
possess
the
land
,
and
also
for
other
wise
purposes
,
which
purposes
,
are
known
unto
the
Lord
;
wherefore
,
I
,
Nephi
,
did
make
a
record
upon
the
other
plates
,
which
gives
an
account
,
or
which
gives
a
greater
account
of
the
wars
,
and
contentions
,
and
destructions
ofmy
people
.
And
this
have
I
done
,
and
commanded
my
people
what
they
should
do
,
after
I
was
gone
,
and
that
these
plates
should
be
handed
down
from
one
pen
eration
to
another
,
or
from
one
prophet
to
another
,
until
further
commandments
of
the
Lord
.
And
an
account
of
my
making
these
plates
shall
be
given
hereafter
;
and
then
,
behold
,
I
proceed
according
to
that
which
I
have
spoken
;
and
this
I
do
,
that
the
more
sacred
things
may
be
kept
for
the
knowledge
of
my
people
.
Nevertheless
,
I
do
not
write
any
thing
upon
plates
,
save
it
be
that
I
think
it
be
sacred
..
And
now
,
if
[
do
err
,
even
did
they
err
of
old
.
Not
that
I
would
excuse
myself
because
of
other
men
,
but
because
of
the
weakness
which
isin
me
,
according
to
the
flesh
,
I
would
excuse
myself
For
the
things
which
some
men
esteem
to
be
of
great
worth
,
both
to
the
body
and
soul
,
others
set
at
nought
,
and
trample
under
their
feet
.
Yea
,
even
the
very
God
of
Israel
,
do
men
trample
under
their
feet
;
I
say
,
trample
under
their
feet
;
but
I
would
speak
in
other
words
:
They
set
him
at
nought
,
and
hearken
not
to
the
voice
of
his
counsels
;
and
behold
,
he
cometh
according
to
the
words
of
the
angel
,
in
six
hundred
years
ees
the
time
my
father
left
Jerusalem
.
And
the
world
,
because
of
their
iniquity
,
shall
judge
him
to
be
a
thing
of
nought
;
wherefore
,
they
scourge
him
,
and
he
suffereth
it
;
and
they
smite
him
,
and
he
suffereth
it
.
Yea
,
they
spit
upon
him
,
and
he
suffereth
it
,
because
of
his
loving
kindness
and
his
long'
suffering
to
[File:053]
wards
the
children
of
meni
;
And
the
God
of
our
fathers
,
who
were
led
out
of
Egypt
,
out
of
bondage
,
and
also
were
preserved
inthe
wilderness
by
him
;
yea
,
the
God
of
Abraham
,
dnd
of
Isaac
,
and
the
God
of
Jacob
,
yieldeth
.
himself
according
to
the
words
of
the
angel
,
as
a
man
,
into
the
hands
of
wicked
men
,
to
be
lifted
up
according
:
to
the
words
of
Zenock
,
and
to
be
crucified
,
according
to
the
words
of
Neum
,
and
to
be
buried
in
a
sepulchre
,
according
to
the
words
of
Zenos
,
which
he
spake
concerning
the
three
days
of
darkness
,
which
should
be
a
sign
given
of
his
death
,
unto
those
who
should
inhabit
the
isles
of
the
sea
;
more
especially
given
unto
those
who
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
.
For
,
thus
spake
the
prophet
,
the
Lord
God
surely
shall
visit
all
the
house
of
Israel
at
that
day
:
some
with
his
voice
,
because
of
their
righteousness
,
unto
their
great
joy
and
salvation
;
and
otherswith
the
thundermgs
and
the
lightnings
of
his
power
,
by
tempest
,
by
fire
,
and
by
smoke
,
and
vapour
of
darkness
,
and
by
the
opening
.
of
-
the
earth
,
and
by
mountains
which
shall
be
carried
up
;
and
all
these
things
must
surely
come
,
saith
the
prophet
Zenos
..
And
the
rocks
of
the
earth
must
rend
;
and
because
of
the
groanings
of
the
earth
,
many
of
the
kings
of
the
isles
of
the
sea
shall
be
wrought
upon
by
the
spirit
of
God
,
to
exclaim
,
the
God
of
nature
suffers
.
And
as
for
those
who
are
at
Jerusalem
,
saith
.
the
prophet
,
shall
be
scourged
by
all
people
,
because
they
crucify
the
God
of
Israel
,
and
turn
their
hearts
aside
,
rejecting
signs
and
wonders
,
and
power
and
glory
0
the
God
of
Israel
;
and
because
they
turn
their
hearts
aside
,
saith
the
prophet
,
and
:
have
despised
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
they
shall
wander
in
the
flesh
,
and
perish
,
and
become
a
hiss
and
a
by
-
word
,
and
be
hated
among
allnations
;
nevertheless
,
when
that
day
cometh
,
saith
the
prophet
,
that
they
no
more
turn
aside
their
hearts
against
the
Holy
one
of
Israel
,
then
will
he
remember
the
covenants
which
he
made
to
:
their
fathers
;
yea
,
then
will
he
remember
the
isles
of
the
sea
;
yea
,
and
allthe
people
who
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
,
will
I
gather
m
,
saith
the
Lord
,
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophet
Zenos
,
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
-
earth
;
yes
,
and
all
the
earth
shall
see
the
salvation
of
:
the
Lord
,
saith
the
prophet
;
every
nation
,
kindred
,
tongue
and
people
;
shall
be
blessed
.
And
I
,
Nephi
,
have
written
these
things
unto
my
people
,
that
perhaps
I
might
persuade
them
that
they
[File:054]
would
remember
the
Lord
their
Redeemer
;
wherefore
,
I
-
speak
unto
all
the
house
of
Israel
,
if
it
so
be
that
they
should
obtain
these
things
.
For
behold
,
I
have
workings
in
the
spirit
,
which
doth
weary
me
,
even
that
all
my
joints
are
weak
,
for
those
who
are
at
Jerusalem
;
for
had
not
the
Lord
been
merciful
,
to
shew
unto
me
concerning
them
,
even
as
he
had
prophets
of
old
,
I
should
have
perished
also
:
and
he
surely
did
shew
unto
the
prophets
of
old
,
all
things
concerning
them
;
and
also
he
did
shew
unto
many
concerning
us
;
wherefore
,
it
must
needs
be
,
that
we
know
concerning
them
,
for
they
are
written
upon
the
plates
of
brass
.
.
CHAPTER
VI
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
teach
my
brethren
these
things
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
read
many
things
to
them
,
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
that
they
might
know
concerning
the
doings
of
the
Lord
in
other
lands
,
among
people
of
old
.
And
I
did
read
many
things
unto
them
,
which
were
written
in
the
book
of
Moses
;
but
that
I
might
more
fully
persuade
them
to
believe
in
the
Lord
their
Redeemer
,
I
did
read
unto
them
that
which
was
written
by
the
prophet
Isaiah
;
for
I
did
liken
all
scriptures
unto
us
,
that
it
might
be
for
our
profit
and
learning
..
Wherefore
,
I
spake
unto
them
,
saying
,
hear
ye
the
words
of
the
prophet
,
ye
who
are
a
remnant
of
the
house
of
Israel
,
a
branch
who
have
been
broken
off
;
hear
ye
the
words
of
the
prophet
,
which
were
written
unto
all
the
house
of
Israel
,
and
liken
them
unto
yourselves
,
that
ye
may
have
hope
as
well
as
your
brethren
,
from
whom
ye
have
.
been
broken
off
.
.
For
after
this
manner
has
the
prophet
written
:
Hearken
and
hear
this
,
O
house
of
Jacob
,
who
are
called
by
the
name
of
Israel
,.
and
are
come
forth
out
of
the
waters
of
Judah
,
who
swear
by
the
-
name
of
the
Lord
,
and
make
mention
of
the
God
of
Israel
;
yet
they
swear
not
in
truth
,
nor
in
righteousness
,
.
Nevertheless
,
they
call
themeelves
of
the
Holy
city
,
but
,
they
do
not
.
stay
themselves
upon
the
God
of
Israel
,
who
is
the
Lord
.
of
hosts
:
yea
,
the
:
Lord
of
-
hosts
is
his
name
.
Behold
,
I
have
declared
the
former
things
from
the
beginning
;
[File:055]
and
they
went
forth
out
of
my
:
mouth
,
and
I
shewed
them
;
did
shew
them
suddenly
.
And
I
did
it
be+
cause
I
knew
thatthou
art
obstinate
,
and
thy
neck
was
an
iron
sinew
,
and
thy
brow
brass
;
and
Lhave
,
even
from
the
beginning
,
declared
to
thee
;
before
it
came
to
pass
I
shewed
them
thee
;
and
I
shewed
them
for
fear
lest
thou
shouldst
say
;
mine
idol
hath
done
them
,
and
m
graven
image
,
'and
my
molten
image
,
hath
commanded
them
.
Thou
hast
seen
and
heard
all
this
;
and
will
ye
not
declare
them
?
And
that
I
have
shewed
thee
new
things
from
this
time
,
even
hidden
.
things
,
and
thou
didst
not
know
them
.
They
are
created
now
,
and
not
fromthe
beginning
;
even
before
the
day
when
thou
heardest
them
not
,
they
weve
declared
unto
thee
,
lest
thou
shouldst
say
,
behold
,
I
knew
them
.
Yea
,
and
thou
heardest
not
;:
yea
,
thou
knewest
not
;
yea
,
from
that
time
thine
ear
was
not
opened
:
for
I
knew
that
thou
wouldst
deal
very
treacherously
,
and
wast
called
a
transgressor
from
the
womb
.
Nevertheless
,
for
my
name's
sake
will
I
defer
mine
anger
,
and
for
my
praise
will
I
refrain
from
thee
,
that
I
cut
thee
not
off
.
For
,
behold
,
I
have
refined
thee
;
I
have
chosen
thee
in
the
furnace
of
affliction
.
For
mine
own
sake
,
yea
,
for
mine
own
sake
,
will
I
do
this
;
for
I
will
not
suffer
my
name
to
be
polluted
,
and
I
wilk
not
give
my
glory
unto
another
.
Hearken
unto
me
,
O
Jacob
,
and
Israel
my
called
;
for
I
am
he
;
I
am
the
first
,
and
I
am
also
the
last
:.
~
Mine
hand
hath
also
laid
the
foundation
of
the
earth
,
and
my
right
hand
hath
spanned
the
heavens
:
I
call
unto
them
,
and
they
stand
up
together
.
All
ye
,
assemble
yourselves
,
and
hear
;
who
among
them
hath
declared
these
things
unto
them
?
The
Lord
hath
loved
him
:
yea
,
and
he
will
fulfil
his
word
which
he
hath
declared
by
them
;
and
he
will
do
his
pleasure
on
Babylon
,
and
his
arm
shall
come
upon
the
Chaldeans
..
Also
,
saith
the
Lord
:
I
the
Lord
,
yea
,
I
have
spoken
;
yea
,
I
have
called
him
,
to
declare
,
Shave
brought
him
,
and
he
shall
make
his
way
prosperous
,
Come
ye
near
unto
me
:
[
have
not
spoken
in
seeret
from
the
beginning
;
from
the
time
that
it
was
declared
,
have
I
spoken
;
and
the
Lord
God
,
and
his
spirit
,
hath
sent
me
.
And
thus
saith
the
Lord
,
thy
Redeemer
,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
:
I
have
sent
him
,
the
Lord
thy
God
who
teacheth
thee
to
profit
,
who
leadeth
thee
by
the
way
thou
shouldst
go
,
has
done'it
:
O
that
ou
hadst
hearkened
to
my
commandment
!
then
had
[File:056]
thy
peace
been
as
a
river
,
and
thy
righteousness
as
the
waves
of
the
sea
:
thy
seed
also
had
been
as
the
sand
;
the
offspring
of
thy
bowels
like
the
gravel
thereof
:
his
name
:
should
not
have
been
cut
off
nor
destroyed
from
before
me
.
Go
ye
forth
of
Babylon
,
flee
ye
from
the
Chaldeans
,
with
a
voice
of
singing
declare
ye
,
tell
this
,
utter
to
the
end
of
the
earth
;
say
ye
,
the
Lord
hath
redeemed
his
servant
Jacob
.
And
they
thirsted
not
:
he
led
them
through
the
deserts
:
he
caused
the
waters
to
flow
out
of
the
rock
for
them
:
he
clave
the
reck
also
,
and
the
waters
gushed
out
.
And
notwithstanding
he
hath
done
all
this
,
and
greater
also
,
there
is
no
peace
,
saith
the
Lord
unto
the
wicked
.
And
again
:
Hearken
,
O
ye
house
of
Israel
,
all
ye
that
are
broken
off
and
are
driven
out
,
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
pastors
of
my
people
;
yea
,
all
ye
that
are
broken
off
,
that
are
scattered
abroad
,
who
:
are
of
my
people
,
O
house
of
Israel
.
Listen
O
isles
,
unto
me
;
and
:
hearken
,
ye
people
,
from
far
;
the
Lord
hath
called
me
from
the
womb
;
from
the
bowels
.
of
my
mother
hath
he
made
mention
of
my
name
.
And
he
hath
made
my
mouth
like
a
sharp
sword
;
in
the
shadow
of
his
hand
hath
he
hid
me
,
and
made
me
a
polished
shaft
:
in
his
quiver
hath
he
hid
me
;
and
said
unto
me
,
thou
art
my
servant
,
O
Israe}
,
in
whom
I
will
be
glorified
.
Then
I
said
,
I
have
labored
in
vain
,
I
have
spent
my
strength
for
nought
,
and
in
vain
;
surely
,
my
judgment
is
with
the
Lord
,
and
my
work
with
my
od
.
And
now
,
saith
the
Lord
,
that
formed
me
from
the
womb
that
I
shoufd
be
his
servant
,
to
bring
Jacob
again
to
him
:
Though
Israel
be
not
gathered
,
yet
shall
I
be
glorious
in
the
eyes
of
the
Lord
,
and
my
God
shall
be
my
strength
.
And
he
said
,
it
is
a
light
thing
that
thou
shouldst
be
my
servant
to
raise
up
the
tribes
of
Jacob
,
and
to
restore
the
preserved
of
Israel
.
I
will
also
give
thee
for
a
light
.
to
the
Gentiles
,
that
thou
mayest
.
be
my
salvation
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
.
Thus
saith
the
Lord
,
the
Redeemer
of
Israel
,
his
Holy
One
,
to
him
whom
man
despiseth
,
to
him
whom
the
nations
abhorreth
,
to
servant
of
rulers
,
kings
shall
see
and
arise
,
princes
also
shall
worship
,
because
:
of
the
Lord
that
is
faithful
.
Thus
saith
the
Lord
,
in
:
an
acceptable
time
have
I
heard
:
thee
,
O
isles
of
the
.
sea
,
and
.
in
a
.
day
-
of
salvation
have
I
helped
thee
:.
and
I
will
preserve
thee
,
and
give
thee
my
servant
for
-
a
covenant
of
the
people
,
[File:057]
to
establish
the
earth
,
to
cause
to
inherit
the
desolate
heritages
:
that
thou
mayest
say
to
the
prisoners
,
Go
forth
;
to
them
that
sit
in
darkness
,
Shew
yourselves
.
They
shall
feed
in
the
ways
,
and
their
pastures'
shall
be
in
all
high
places
.
They
shall
not
hunger
nor
thirst
,
neither
shall
the
heat
nor
the
sun
smite
them
:
for
he
that
hath
mercy
on
them
shall
lead
them
,
even
by
the
springs
of
water
shall
he
guide
them
.
And
I
will
make
all
my
mountains
away
,
and
my
highways
shall
be
exalted
.
And
then
,
O
house
of
Israel
,
behold
,
these
shall
come
from
far
;
and
lo
,
these
from
the
north
and
from
the
west
;
and
these
from
the
land
of
Sinim
.
Sing
,
O
heavens
;
and
be
joyful
,
O
earth
;
for
the
feet
of
those
who
are
in
the
east
shall
be
established
;
and
break
forth
into
singing
,
O
mountains
:
for
they
shall
be
smitten
no
more
:
for
the
Lord
hath
comforted
his
people
,
and
will
have
mercy
upon
his
afflicted
..
But
,
behold
,
Zion
hath
said
,
the
Lord
hath
forsaken
me
,
and
my
Lord
hath
forgotten
me
;
but
he
will
shew
that
he
hath
not
.
For
can
a
woman
forget
her
sucking
child
,
that
she
should
not
have
compassion
on
the
son
of
her
womb
?
Yea
,
they
may
forget
,
yet
will
I
not
forget
thee
,
O
house
of
Israel
.
Behold
,
I
have
graven
thee
upon
the
palms
of
my
hands
;
thy
walls
are
continually
before
me
.
Thy
children
shall
make
haste
against
thy
destroyers
;
and
they
that
made
thee
waste
,
shall
go
forth
of
thee
.
Lift
up
thine
eyes
round
about
,
and
behold
:
all
these
gather
themselves
together
,
and
they
shall
come
to
thee
.
And
as
I
live
,
saith
the
Lord
,
thou
shalt
surely
clothe
thee
with
them
all
,
as
with
an
ornament
,
and
bind
them
on
even
as
a
bride
.
For
thy
waste
and
th
desolate
places
,
and
the
land
of
thy
destruction
,
shall
even
now
be
too
narrow
by
reason
of
the
inhabitants
;
and
they
that
swallowed
thee
up
,
shall
be
far
away
..
The
children
whom
thou
shalt
have
,
after
thou
hast
lost
the
first
,
shall
again
in
thine
ears
say
,
the
place
is
too
straight
for
me
:
give
place
to
me
that
I
may
dwell
.
Then
shait
thou
say
in
thine
heart
,
who
liath
begotten
me
these
,
seeing
I
have
lost
my
children
,
and
am
desolate
,
a
captive
,
and
removing
to
and
fro
?
and
who
hath
brought
up
these
?
Behold
,
I
was
left
alone
;
these
,
where
have
they
been
?
Thus
saith
the
Lord
God
,
behold
,
I
will
lift
up
mine
hand
to
the
Gentiles
,
and
:
set
upmy
standard
to
the
people
:
and
they'shall
bring
thy
sons
.
in
their
arms
,
and
thy
daughters
shall
[File:058]
be
carried
upon
their
shoulders
.
And
kings
shall
be
thy
nursing
fathers
,
and
their
queens
thy
nursing
mothers
:
they
shall
bow
down
to
thee
with
their
face
towards
the
earth
,
and
lick
up
the
dust
of
thy
feet
;
and
thou
shalt
know
that
I
am
the
Lord
:
for
they
shall
not'be
ashamed
that
wait
for
me
.
For
shall
the
prey
be
taken
from
the
mighty
,
or
the
lawful
captives
delivered
?
But
thus
saith
the
Lord
,
even
the
captives
of
the
mighty
shall
be
taken
away
,
and
the
prey
of
the
terrible
shall
be
delivered
:
for
I
will
contend
with
him
that
contendeth
with
thee
,
and
I
will
save
thy
children
.
And
I
will
feed
them
that
oppress
thee
with
their
own
flesh
;
they
shall
be
drunken
with
their
own
blood
,
as
with
sweet
wine
:
and
all
flesh
shall
know
that
I
the
Lord
am
thy
Savior
and
thy
Redeemer
,
the
mighty
one
of
Jacob

CHAPTER
VII
.
Anp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
afterI
,
Nephi
,
had
read
these
things
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
my
brethren
came
unto
me
and
said
unto
me
,
what
meaneth
these
things
which
ye
have
read
?
_Behold
,
are
they
to
be
understood
according
to
things
which
are
spiritual
,
which
shall
come
to
pass
according
to
the
spirit
and
not
the
flesh
?
And
I
,
Nephi
,
said
unto
them
,
behold
,
they
were
manifest
unto
the
prophet
,
by
the
voice
of
the
spirit
:
for
by
the
spirit
are
all
things
made
known
unto
the
prophets
,
which
shall
come
upon
the
children
of
men
according
to
the
flesh
,
Wherefore
,
the
things
of
which
I
have
read
,
are
things
pertaining
to
things
both
temporal
and
spiritual
:
for
it
appears
that
the
house
of
Israel
,
sooner
or
later
,
will
be
scattered
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
,
and
also
among
all
nations
,
and
behold
there
are
many
who
are
already
lost
from
the
knowledge
of
those
who
are
at
Jerusalem
.
Yea
,
the
more
part
of
all
the
tribes
have
been
led
away
;
and
they
are
scattered
to
and
fro
upon
the
isles
of
the
sea
:
and
whither
they
are
,
none
of
us
xnoweth
,
save
that
we
know
that
they
have
been
led
away
.
And
since
they
have
been
led
away
,
these
things
have
been
prophesied
concerning
them
,
and
also
concerning
all
those
who
shall
hereafter
be
iseatter
[File:059]
ed
and
be
confounded
,
because
of
the
holy
One
of
Israel
;
for
against
him
will
they
harden
their
hearts
;
.
wherefore
,
they
shall
be
scattered
.
among
all
nations
,
and
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
.
Nevertheless
,
after
they
shall
be
nursed
by
the
Gentiles
,
and
the
Lord
has
lifted
up
his
hand
upen
the
Gentiles
and
set
them
up
for
a
standard
,
and
their
children
have
been
carried
in
their
arms
,
and
their
daughters
have
been
carried
upon
their
shoulders
,
behold
,
these
things
of
which
are
spoken
,
are
temporal
:
for
thus
is
the
covenants
of
the
Lord
with
our
fathers
;
and
it
meaneth
us
in
the
days
to
come
,
and
also
all
our
brethren
who
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
.
And
it
meaneth
that
the
time
.
cometh
that
after
all
the
house
of
Israel
have
been
scattered
and
confounded
,
that
the
Lord
God
will
raise
up
a
mighty
nation
among
the
Gentiles
.
yea
,
even
upon
the
face
of
this
land
;
and
by
them
shall
our
seed
be
scattered
..
And
after
our
seed
is
scattered
,
the
Lord
God
will
proceed
to
doa
marvellous
work
among
the
Gentiles
,
which
shall
be
of
great
worth
unto
our
seed
;
wherefore
,
it
is
likened
unto
the
being
nourished
by
the
Gentiles
,
and
being
carried
in
their
arms
,
and
upon
their
shoulders
.
And
it
shall
also
be
of
worth
unto
the
Gentiles
:
and
not
only
unto
the
Gentiles
,
but
unto
all
the
house
of
Israel
,
unto
the
making
known
of
the
covenants
of
the
Father
of
heaven
unto
Abraham
,
saying
,
in
thy
seed
shall
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
be
blessed
.
And
I
would
,
my
brethren
,
that
ye
should
know
that
all
the
kindreds
of
the
earth
cannot
be
blessed
,
unless
he
shall
make
bare
his
arm
in
the
eyes
of
the
nations
.
Wherefore
,
the
Lord
God
will
proceed
to
make
bare
his
arm
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
nations
,
in
bringing
about
his
covenants
and
his
gospel
,
unto
those
who
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
.
Wherefore
,
he
will
bring
them
again
out
of
captivity
and
they
shall
be
gathered
together
to
the
lands
of
their
inheritance
:
and
they
shall
be
brought
out
of
obscurity
,
and
out
of
darkness
;
and
they
shall
know
that
the
Lord
is
their
Savior
and
their
Redeemer
,
the
mighty
one
of
Israel
.
And
the
bloodof
that
great
and
abominable
church
,
which
is
the
whore
ofall
the
earth
,
shall
turn
upon
their
own
heads
;
for
they
shall
war
among
themselves
,
and
the
sword
of
their
own
hands
shall
fall
upon
their
own
heads
,
and
they
shall
be
drunken
with
their
own
blood
.
And
every
nation
which
shall
war
.
against
thee
,
O
house
of
Israel
,
shall
be
turned
one
against
another
,
and
they
shall
fall
into
the
pit
which
they
.
digged
to
[File:060]
ensnare
the
[people
of
the
Lord
.
And
all
that
fight
against
Zion
,
shall
be
destroyed
.
And
that
great
whore
,
who
hath
perverted
the
right
ways
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
that
great
and
abominable
church
,
shall
tumble
to
the
dust
,
and
great
shall
be
the
fall
of
it
.
For
behold
,
saith
the
prophet
,
the
time
cometh
speedily
,
that
satan
shall
have
no
more
power
ever
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
:
for
the
day
soon
cometh
,
that
all
the
proud
and
they
who
do
wickedly
,
shall
be
as
stubble
;
and
the
day
cometh
that
they
must
be
burned
.
For
the
time
soon
cometh
,
that
the
fulness
of
the
wrath
of
God
shall
be
poured
out
upon
all
the
children
of
men
:
for
he
will
not
suffer
that
the
wicked
shall
destroy
the
righteous
.
Wherefore
,
he
will
preserve
the
righteous
by
his
power
,
even
if
it
so
be
that
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
must
come
,
and
the
righteous
be
preserved
,
even
unto
the
destruction
of
theirenemies
by
Gre
.
Wherefore
,
the
righteous
need
not
fear
:
for
thus
saith
the
rophet
,
they
shall
be
saved
,
even
if
it
so
be
as
by
fire
.
ehold
,
my
brethren
,
Isay
unto
you
,
that
these
things
must
shortly
come
;
yea
,
even
blood
,
and
fire
,
and
vapor
of
smoke
must
come
;
and
it
must
needs
be
upon
the
face
of
this
earth
;
and
it
cometh
unto
men
according
to
the
flesh
,
if
it
so
be
that
they
will
harden
their
hearts
against
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
:
for
behold
,
the
righteous
shall
not
perish
;
for
the
time
surely
must
come
,
that
all
they
who
fight
against
Zion
,
shall
be
cut
off
.
And
the
Lord
will
surely
prepare
a
way
for
his
people
,
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
words
of
Moses
,
which
he
spake
,
saying
:
A
prophet
shall
the
Lord
your
God
raise
up
unto
you
,
like
unto
me
;
him
shall
ye
hear
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
shall
say
unto
you
.
And
it
shall
come
to
-
pass
that
all
those
who
will
not
hear
that
prophet
,
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
the
people
.
And
now
I
,
Nephi
,
declare
unto
you
,
that
this
prophet
of
whom
Moses
spake
,
was
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
;
wherefore
,
he
shall
execute
judgment
in
righteousness
;
and
the
righteous
need
not
fear
,
for
they
are
those
who
shall
not
be
confounded
.
But
it
is
the
kingdom
of
the
devil
which
shall
.
be
built
up
among
the
children
of
men
,
which
kingdom
is
established
among
them
which
are
in
the
flesh
:
forthe
time
speedily
shall
come
,
that
all
churches
which
are
built
up
to
get
gain
,
and
all
those
who
are
built
up
to
get
power
over
tae
flesh
,
and
those
who
are
built
up
to
become
popular
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
,
and
those
who
seek
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
and
the
things
of
the
werld
,
and
te
do
all
manner
of
[File:061]
iniquity
;
yea
,
in
fine
,
all
those
who
belong
to
the
kingdom
of
the
devil
,
are
they
who
need
fear
,
and
tremble
,
and
quake
;
they
are
those
who
must
be
brought
low
in
the
dust
;
they
are
those
who
must
be
consumed
as
stubble
:
and
this
is
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophet
.
And
the
time
cometh
speedily
,
that
the
righteous
must
be
led
up
as
calves
of
the
stall
,
and
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
must
reign
in
dominion
,
and
might
,
and
power
,
and
great
glory
.
And
he
gathereth
his
children
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
;
and
he
numbereth
his
sheep
,
and
they
know
him
;
and
there
shall
be
one
fold
and
one
shepherd
:
and
he
shall
feed
his
sheep
,
and
in
him
they
shall
find
pasture
.
And
because
of
the
righteousness
of
his
people
,
satan
has
no
power
;
wherefore
,
he
cannot
be
loosed
for
the
space
of
many
years
;
for
he
hath
no
power
over
the
hearts
of
the
people
,
for
they
dwell
in
righteousness
,
and
{the
Holy
One
of
Israel
reigneth
.
And
now
behold
,
I
,
Nephi
,
say
unto
you
,
that
all
these
things
miust
come
according
to
the
flesh
,
But
,
behold
,
all
nations
,
kindreds
,
tongues
,
and
people
,
shall
dwell
safely
in
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
if
it
so
be
that
they
will
repent
.
And
now
I
,
Nephi
,
make
an
end
;
for
I
durst
not
speak
further
as
yet
,
concerning
these
things
.
Wherefore
,
my
brethren
,
I
would
that
ye
should
consider
that
the
things
which
have
been
written
upon
the
plates
of
brass
,
are
true
;
and
they
testify
that
a
man
must
be
obedient
to
the
commandments
of
God
..
Wherefore
,
ye
need
not
suppose
that
I
and
my
father
are
the
only
ones
that
have
testified
,
and
also
taught
them
.
Wherefore
,
if
ye
shall
be
obedient
to
the
commandments
,
and
endure
to
the
end
,
ye
shall
be
saved
at
the
last
day
.
And
thus
itis
.
Amen

.
His
journeyings
in
the
wilderness
,
&Â§
.
Anp
now
it
came
to
pass
after
I
,
Nephi
,
had
made
an
end
of
teaching
my
brethren
,
our
father
,
Lehi
,
also
spake
many
things
unto
them
,
how
great
things
the
Lord
had
done
for
them
,
in
bringing
them
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
.
And
he
spake
unto
them
concerning
their
rebellions
upon
the
waters
,
and
the
mercies
of
God
in
sparing
their
lives
,
that
they
were
not
swallowed
up
in
the
sea
.
And
he
also
spake
unto
them
concerning
the
land
of
promise
,
which
they
had
obtained
:
how
merciful
the
Lord
had
been
in
warning
us
that
we
should
flee
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
..
For
,
behold
,
said
he
,
I
have
seen
a
vision
,
in
which
I
know
that
Jerusalem
is
destroyed
;
and
had
we
remained
in
Jerusalem
,
we
should
also
have
perished
.
But
,
said
he
,
notwithstanding
our
afflictions
,
we
have
obtained
a
land
of
promise
,
a
land
which
is
choice
above
all
other
lands
;
aland
which
the
Lord
Ged
hath
covenanted
with
me
should
be
a
land
for
the
inheritance
of
my
seed
.
Yea
,
the
Lord
hath
covenanted
this
land
unto
me
,
and
to
my
children
forever
;
and
also
all
those
who
should
be
Jed
out
of
other
countries
,
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
.
Wherefore
,
I
,
Lehi
,
prophesy
according
to
the
workings
of
the
spirit
which
isin
me
,
that
there
shall
none
come
into
this
land
,
save
they
shall
be
brought
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
.
Wherefore
,
this
land
is
consecrated
unto
him
whom
he
shall
bring
..
And
if
it
so
be
that
they
shall
serve
him
according
to
the
commandments
which
he
hath
given
,
it
shall
be
a
land
of
liberty
unto
them
;
wherefore
,
they
shall
never
be
brought
down
into
captivity
:
if
so
,
it
shall
be
because
of
iniquity
:
for
if
iniquity
shall
abound
,
:
cursed
shall
be
the
land
for
their
sakes
;
but
unto
the
righteous
,
it
shall
be
blessed
forever
.
And
behold
,
it
is
wisdom
that
this
land
should
be
kept
as
yet
from
the
knowledge
of
other
nations
:
for
behold
,
many
nations
[File:063]
would
overrun
the
land
,
that
there
.
would
be
no
place
for
an
inheritance
.
Wherefore
,
I
,
Lehi
,
have
obtained
a
promise
,
that
inasmuch
as
those
whom
the
Lord
God
shall
bring
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
shall
keep
his
commandments
,
they
shall
prosper
upon
the
face
of
this
lard
;
and
they
shall
be
kept
from
all
other
nations
,
that
they
may
possess
this
land
unto
themselves
.
And
if
itso
be
that
they
shall
keep
his
commandments
,
they
shall
be
blessed
upon
the
face
of
this
land
,
and
there
shall
be
none
to
molest
them
,
nor
to
take
away
the
land
of
their
inheritance
;
and
they
shall
dwell
safely
forever
.
But
behold
,
when
the
time
cometh
that
shay
shall
dwindle
in
unbelief
,
after
they
have
received
so
great
blessings
from
the
hand
of
the
Lord
;
having
a
knowledge
of
the
creation
of
the
earth
,
and
all
men
,
knowing
the
great
and
marvellous
works
of
the
Lord
from
the
creation
of
the
world
;
haying
power
given
them
to
do
all
things
by
faith
;
having
all
the
commandments
from
the
beginning
,
and
having
been
bro't
by
his
infinite
goodness
into
this
precious
land
of
promise
;
behold
,
I
say
,
if
the
day
shall
come
that
they
will
reject
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
the
true
Messiah
,
their
Redeemer
and
their
.
God
,
behold
,
the
judgments
of
him
that
is
just
,
shll
rest
upon
them
;
yea
,
he
will
bring
other
nations
unto
them
,
and
he
will
give
unto
them
power
,
and
he
will
take
away
from
them
the
lands
of
their
possessions
;
and
he
will
cause
them
to
be
scattered
and
smitten
.
Yea
,
as
one
generation
passeth
to
another
,
there
shall
be
bloodsheads
and
great
visitations
among
them
;
wherefore
,
my
sons
,
I
would
that
ye
would
remember
;
yea
,
I
would
that
ye
would
hearken
unte
my
words
.
O
that
ye
would
awake
;
awake
from
a
deep
sleep
,
yea
,
even
from
the
sleep
of
hell
,
and
shake
off
the
awful
chains
by
which
ye
are
bound
,
which
are
the
chains
which
bind
the
children
of
men
,
that
they
are
carried
away
captive
down
to
the
eternal
gulf
of
misery
and
wo
!
Awake
!
and
arise
from
the
dust
,
and
hear
the
words
of
a
trembling
parent
,
whose
limbs
ye
must
soon
lay
down
in
the
cold
and
silent
grave
,
from
whence
no
traveller
can
return
:
a
few
more
days
,
and
I
go
the
way
of
all
the
earth
..
But
.
behold
,
the
Lord
hath
redeemed
my
soul
from
hell
:
I
have
beheld
his
glory
,
and
J
am
encircled
about
eternally
.
in
the
arms
of
his
love
.
And
I
desire
that
ye
should
..
remember
to
observe
the
statutes
and
the
judgments
of
the
Lord
:
behold
,
this
hath
been
the
[File:064]
anxiety
of
my
soul
,
from
the
beginning
.
My
heart
hath
been
weighed
down
with
sorrow
from
time
to
time
:
for
I
have
feared
,
lest
for
the
hardness
of
your
hearts
,
the
Lord
your
God
should
come
out
in
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
,
upon
you
,
that
ye
be
cut
off
and
destroyed
furever
;
or
,
that
a
cursing
should
come
upon
you
for
the
space
of
many
generations
;
and
ye
are
visited
by
sword
,
and
by
famine
,
and
are
hated
,
and
are
led
according
to
the
will
and
captivity
of
the
devil
.
O
my
sons
,
that
these
things
might
not
come
upon
you
,
but
that
ye
might
be
a
choice
and
a
favored
people
of
the
Lord
.
But
,
behold
,
his
will
be
done
:
for
his
ways
are
righteousness
forever
;
and
he
hath
said
,
that
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
shall
prosperin
the
land
;
but
inasmuch
as
ye
will
not
keepmy
commandments
,
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
my
presence
.
and
now
that
my
soul
might
have
joy
in
you
,
and
that
my
heart
might
leave
this
world
with
gladness
because
of
you
;
that
I
might
not
be
brought
down
with
grief
and
sorrow
to
the
grave
,
arise
from
the
dust
,
my
sons
,
and
be
men
,
and
ve
determined
in
one
mind
,
and
in
one
heart
united
in
all
things
,
that
ye
may
not
come
down
into
captivity
;
that
ye
may
not
be
cursed
with
a
sore
cursing
;
and
also
,
that
ve
may
not
incur
the
displeasure
ofa
just
God
upon
you
,
unto
the
destruction
,
yea
,
the
eternal
destruction
of
both
soul
and
body
.
Awake
,
my
sons
:
put
on
the
armor
of
righteousness
.
Shake
off
the
chains
with
which
ye
are
bound
,
and
come
forth
out
of
obscurity
,
and
arise
from
the
dust
.
Rebel
no
more
against
your
brother
,
whose
views
have
been
glorious
,
and
who
hath
kept
the
commandments
from
the
time
that
we
left
Jerusalem
,
and
who
hath
been
an
instrument
in
the
:
hands
of
God
,
in
bringing
us
forth
into
the
land
of
promise
:
for
were
it
not
for
him
,
we
must
have
perished
with
hunger
in
the
wilderness
;
nevertheless
,
ye
sought
to
take
away
his
life
;
yea
,
and
be
hath'
suffered
much
sorrow
because
of
you
.
And
I
exceedingly
fear
and
tremble
because
of
you
,
lest
he
shall
suffer
again
:
for
behold
,
ye
have
accused
him
that
he
sought
power
and
authority
over
you
;
but
I
know
that
he
-
hath
not
sought
for
power
nor
authority
over
you
:
but
he
hath
sought
the
lory
of
God
,
and
your
own
eternal
welfare
.,
And
ye
ave
murmured
because
he
hath
been
plain
unto
you
.
Ye
say
that
he
hath
used
sharpness
;
yeisay
that
he
hath
been
angry
with
you
.
But
behold
,
his
sharpness
was
the
sharpness
of
the
power
of
the
word
of
[File:065]
God
,
which
was
in
him
;
and
that
which
ye
callanger
,
was
the
truth
,
according
to
that
which
is
in
God
,
which
he
could
not
restrain
manifesting
boldly
concerning
your
iniquities
.
And
it
must
needs
be
that
the
power
of
God
must
be
with
him
,
even
unto
his
commanding
you
,
that
ye
must
obey
..
But
behold
,
it
was
not
him
,
but
it
was
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
which
was
in
him
,
which
opened
his
mouth
to
utterance
,
that
he
could
not
shut
it
.
And
now
my
son
Laman
,
and
also
Lemuel
and
Sam
,
and
also
my
sons
who
are
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
behold
,
if
ye
will
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
Nephi
,
ye
shall
not
perish
.
And
if
ye
will
hearken
unto
him
,
{
leave
unto
you
a
blessing
,
yea
,
even
my
first
blessing
.
But
if
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
him
,
I
take
away
my
first
blessing
,
yea
,
even
my
blessing
,
and
it
shall
rest
upon
him
.
And
now
,
Zoram
,
I
speak
unto
you
:
Behold
,
thou
art
the
servant
of
Laban
;
nevertheless
,
thou
hast
been
brought
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
and
[
know
that
thou
art
a
true
friend
unto
my
son
Nephi
,
forever
,
Wherefore
,
because
thou
hast
been
faithful
,
thy
seed
shall
be
blessed
with
his
seed
,
that
they
dwell
in
prosperity
long
upon
the
face
of
this
land
;
and
nothing
,
save
it
shall
be
iniquity
among
them
,
shall
harm
or
disturb
their
prosperity
upon
the
face
of
this
land
forever
.
Wherefore
,
if
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
,
the
Lord
hath
consecrated
this
land
for
the
security
of
thy
seed
with
the
seed
of
my
son
.
And
now
,
Jacob
,
[speak
unto
you
:
Thou
art
my
first
born
in
the
days
of
oe
tribulation
in
the
wilderness
.
And
behold
,
in
thy
childhood
thou
hast
.
suffered
afflictions
and
much
sorrow
,
because
of
the
rudeness
of
thy
brethren
,
Nevertheless
,
Jacob
,
my
first
born
in
the
wilderness
,
thou
knowest
the
greatness
of
God
;
and
he
shall
consecrate
thine
afflictions
for
thy
gain
.
Wherefore
,
thy
soul
shall
be
blessed
,
and
thou
shalt
dwell
safely
with
thy
brother
,
Nephi
;
and
thy
days
.
shall
be
spent
in
the
service
of
thy
God
.
Wherefore
,
I
know
that
thou
art
redeemed
,
because
of
the
righteousness
of
thy
Redeemer
:
for
thou
hast
beheld
,
that
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
he
cometh
to
bring
salvation
unto
men
.
And
thou
hast
beheld
in
thy
youth
,
his
glory
;
wherefore
,
thou
art
blessed
even
as
they
unto
whom
he
shall
minister
in
the
flesh
:
for
the
spirit
is
the
same
,
yesterday
,
to-day
,
and
forever
..
And
the
way
is
prepared
from
the
fallof
man
,
and
salvation
is
free
.
.
And
men
are
instructed
sufficiently
,
[File:066]
that
they
know
good
from
evil
.
And
the
law
is
given
unto
men
.
And
by
the
law
,
no
flesh
is
justified
;
or
,
by
the
law
,
men
are
cut
off
.
Yea
,
by
the
temporal
law
,
they
were
cut
off
;
and
also
,
by
the
spiritual
law
they
perish
from
that
which
is
good
,
and
become
miserable
forever
.
Wherefore
,
redemption
cometh
in
and
through
the
holy
Messiah
:
for
he
is
full
of
grace
and
truth
.
Behold
,
he
offereth
himself
a
sacrifice
for
sin
,
to
answer
the
ends
of
the
law
,
untoall
those
who
have
a
broken
heart
and
a
contrite
spirit
;
and
unto
none
else
can
the
ends
of
the
law
be
answered
.
Wherefore
,
how
great
the
importance
to
make
these
things
known
unto
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
,
that
they
may
know
that
there
is
no
flesh
that
can
dwell
in
the
presence
of
God
,
save
it
be
through
the
merits
,
and
mercy
,
and
grace
of
the
holy
Messiah
,
who
layeth
down
his
life
according
to
the
flesh
,
and
taketh
itagain
by
the
power
of
the
spirit
,
that
he
may
bring
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
,
being
the
first
that
should
rise
..
Wherefore
,
he
is
the
first
fruits
unto
God
,
inasmuch
as
he
shall
make
intercession
for
all
the
children
of
men
;
and
they
that
believe
in
him
,
shall
be
saved
.
Andbecause
of
the
intercession
for
al
!,
all
men
come
unto
God
;
wherefore
,
they
stand
in
the
presence
of
Him
,
to
be
judged
of
Him
,
according
to
the
truth
and
holiness
which
is
in
Him
.
Wheretore
,
the
ends
of
the
law
which
the
Holy
One
hath
given
,
unto
the
inflicting
of
the
punishment
which
is
affixed
,
which
punishment
that
is
affixed
is
in
opposition
to
that
of
the
happiness
whica
is
aflixed
,
to
answer
the
ends
of
the
atonement
;
for
it
must
needs
be
,
that
there
is
an
opposition
in
all
things
.
If
not
so
;
my
first
born
in
the
wilderness
,
'
righteousness
could
not
be
brought
-
to
pass
;
neither
wickedness
;
neither
holiness
nor
misery
;
neither
good
nor
bad
.
Wherefore
,
all
things
must
needs
be
a
compound
in
one
;
wherefore
,
if
it
should
be
one
body
,
it
must
needs
remain
as
dead
,
having
no
life
,
neither
death
nor
corruption
,
nor
ineorruption
,
happiness
nor
misery
,
neither
sense
nor
insensibility
.
Wherefore
,
it
must
needs
have
been
created
for
a
thing
of
nought
;
wherefore
,
there
would
have
been
no
purpose
in
the
end
of
its
creation
.
Wherefore
,
this
thing
must
needs
destroy
the
wisdom
of
-
God
,
'and
his
eternal
purposes
;
and
also
,
the
power
,
and
the
mercy
,
and
the
justice
of
God
.
And
if
ye
shall
say
there
is
no
law
,
ye
shall
al80
say
there
is
no
sin
.
If
ye
shall
say
there
is
no
sin
,
ye
shall
also
say
there
is
no
righteousness
.
And
if
[File:067]
there
be
no
righteousness
,
there
be
no
happiness
..
And
if
there
be
no
righteousness
nor
happiness
,
there
be
no
punishment
nor
misery
.
And
if
these
things
are
not
,
there
is
no
God
.
And
if
there
is
no
God
,
we
are
not
,
neither
the
earth
:
for
-
there
could
have
been
no
creation
of
things
,
neither
to
act
nor
to
be
acted
upon
;
wherefore
,
all
things
must
have
vanished
away
.
And
now
,
my
sons
,
I
speak
unto
you
these
things
,
for
your
profit
and
spacings
for
there
is
a
God
,
and
he
hath
created
all
things
,
both
the
heavens
and
the
earth
,
and
all
things
that
in
them
is
;
both
things
to
act
,
and
things
to
be
acted
upon
;
and
to
bring
about
his
eternal
purposes
in
the
end
of
man
,
after
he
had
created
our
first
parents
,
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
,
and
in
fine
,
all
things
which
are
created
,
it
must
needs
be
that
there
was
an
opposition
;
even
the
forbidden
fruit
in
opposition
to
the
tree
of
life
;
the
one
being
sweet
and
the
other
bitter
;
wherefore
,
the
Lord
God
gave
unto
man
,
that
:
he
should
act
for
himself
Wherefore
,
man
could
not
act
for
himself
,
save
it
should
be
that
he
was
enticed
by
the
one
or
the
other
.
And
I
,
Lehi
,
according
to
the
things
which
I
have
read
,
must
needs
suppose
,
thatan
angel
of
God
,
according
to
that
which
is
written
,
had
fallen
from
heaven
;
wherefore
he
became
a
devil
,
having
sought
that
which
was
evil
before
God
.
And
because
he
had
fallen
from
heaven
,
and
had
become
miserable
forever
,
he
sought
also
the
misery
of
all
mankind
.
Wherefore
,
he
said
unto
Eve
,
yea
,
even
that
old
serpent
,
who
is
the
devil
,
who
is
the
father
of
all
lies
;
wherefore
he
said
,
partake
of
the
forbidden
fruit
,
and
ye
shall
not
die
,
but
ye
shall
be
as
God
,
knowing
good
and
evil
.
And
afler
Adam
and
Eve
had
partaken
of
the
forbidden
fruit
,
they
were
driven
out
of
the
garden
.
of
Eden
,
to
till
the
earth
.
And
they
have
brought
forth
children
;
yea
,
even
the
family
of
all
the
earth
.
And
the
days
of
the
children
of
men
were
prolonged
,
according
to
the
will
of
God
,
that
they
might
repent
while
in
the
flesh
;
wherefore
,
their
state
became
a
state
of
probation
,
and
their
time
was
lengthened
,
according
to
the
commandments
which
the
Lord
God
gave
unto
the
children
ofmen
.
For
he
gave
commandment
that
all
men
must
repent
;
for
he
shewed
unto
all
men
that
they
were
lost
,
because
of
the
transgression
of
their
parents
.
And
now
,
behold
,
if
Adam
had
not
.
trans
[File:068]
gressed
,
he
would
not
have
fallen
;
but
he
would
have
remained
in
the
garden
of
Eden
.
And
all
things
which
were
created
,
must
have
remained
in
the
same
state
which
they
were
,
after
they
were
created
;
and
they
must
have
remained
forever
,
and
had'no
end
.
And
they
would
have
had
no
children
;
wherefore
,
they
would
have
remained
in
a
state
of
innocence
,
having
no
joy
,
for
they
knew
no
misery
:
doing
no
good
,
for
they
knew
no
sin
.
But
beheld
,
all
things
have
been
done
in
the
wisdom
of
him
who
knoweth
all
things
..
Adam
fell
,
that
men
might
be
;
and
men
are
,
that
they
might
have
joy
.
And
the
Messiah
cometh
in
the
fualness
of
time
,
that
he
may
redeem
the
children
of
men
from
the
fall
.
And
because
that
they
are
redeemed
from
the
fall
,
they
have
become
free
forever
,
knowing
good
from
evil
;
to
act
for
themselves
,
and
not
to
be
acted
upon
,
save
it
be
by
the
punishment
of
the
law
,
at
the
great
and
last
day
,
according
to
the
commandments
which
God
hath
given
.
Wherefore
,
men
are
free
according
to
the
flesh
;
and
all
things
are
given
them
which
are
expedient
unto
man
.
And
they
are
free
to
choose
liberty
and
eternal
life
,
through
the
great
mediation
of
all
men
,
or
to
choose
captivity
and
eath
,
according
to
the
captivity
and
power
of
the
devil
:
for
he
seeketh
that
all
men
might
be
miserable
like
unto
himself
.
And
now
,
my
sons
,
I
would
that
ye
should
look
to
the
great
Mediator
,
and
hearken
unto
his
great
commandments
;
and
be
faithful
unto
his
words
,
and
choose
eternal
life
,
according
to
the
will
of
his
Holy
Spirit
,
and
not
choose
eternal
death
,
according
to
the
will
of
the
flesh
and
the
evil
which
is
therein
,
which
giveth
the
spirit
of
the
devil
:
power
to
captivate
,
to
bring
you
down
to
hell
,
that
he
-
may
reign
over
you
in
his
own
kingdom
,
Ihave
spoken
these
few
words
unto
you
all
,
my
sons
,
in
the
last
days
of
my
probation
;
and
I
have
chosen
the
good
part
,
according
tothe
words
of
the
prophet
:
And
J
have
none
other
object
,
save
it
be
the
everlasting
welfare
of
your
souls
.
Amen

CHAPTER
II
.
Anp
now
I
speak
unto
you
,
Joseph
,
miy
last
born
.
Thou
wast
born
in
the
wilderness
of
mine
afflictions
;
yea
,
in
the
days
of
my
greatest
sorrow
,
did
thy
mother
bear
thee
.
And
may
the
Lord
consecrate
also
unto
thee
this
land
,
which
is
a
most
precious
land
,
for
thine
inheritance
and
the
inheritance
of
thy
seed
with
thy
brethren
,
for
thy
security
forever
,
if
it
so
be
that
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of
theHoly
One
of
Isracl
.
And
now
,
Joseph
,
my
last
born
,
whom
I
have
brought
out
of
the
wilderness
of
mine
afflictions
,
may
the
Lord
bless
tnee
forever
,
for
thy
seed
shall
not
-
utterly
be
destroyed
.
For
behold
,
thou
art
the
fruit
of
my
loins
;
and
lam
a
descendant
of
Joseph
,
who
was
carried
captive
into
Egypt
.
And
great
were
the
covenants
of
the
Lord
,
which
he
made
unto
Joseph
;
wherefore
,
Joseph
truly
saw
our
day
.
And
he
obtained
a
promise
of
the
Lord
,
that
out
of
the
fruit
of
his
loins
,
the
Lord
God
would
raise
up
.
a
righteous
branch
unto
the
house
of
Israel
;
not
the
Messiah
,
but
a
branch
which
was
to
be
broken
off
;
nevertheless
,
to
be
remembered
in
the
covenants
of
the
Lord
,
that
the
Messiah
should
be
made
manifest
.
unto
them
.
in
the
latter
days
,
in
the
spirit
of
power
,
unto
the
bringing
of
them
out
of
darkness
unto
light
;
yea
,
out
of
hidden
darkness
and
out
of
captivity
unto
freedom
.
For
Joseph
truly
testified
,
saying
:
A
seer
shall
the
Lord
m
God
raise
up
,
who
shall
be
a
choice
seer
unto
the
fruit
of
my
loins
,
Yea
,
Joseph
truly
said
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
unto
me
:
A
choice
seer
will
I
raise
up
out
of
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
;
and
he
shall
be
esteemed
highly
among
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
.
:
And
unto
him
will
I
ive
.
commandment
,
tlfat
he
shall
do
a
work
for
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
,
his
brethren
,
which
shall
be
of
great
worth
unto
them
,
even
to
the
bringing
of
them
to
the
knowledge
of
the
covenants
which
I
have
made
with
thy
fathers
.
And
I
will
give
unto
him
a
commandment
,
that
he
shall
do
none
other
work
,
save
the
work
which
I
shall
command
him
.
And
J
.
will
make
him
great
in
mine
eyes
:
for
he
shall
do
my
work
.
And
shall
be
great
like
unto
Moses
,
whom
I
have
said
I
would
raise
up
unto
you
,
to
deliver
my
people
,
O
house
of
Israel
.
And
Moses
will
I
raise
up
,
to
deliver
thy
people
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
.
But'a
seer
will
I
raise
up
out
of
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
;
and
unto
him
will
I
give
power
to
bring
ferth
my
word
:
unto
the
[File:070]
seed
of
thy
loins
;
and
not
to
the
bringing
forth
my
word
only
,
saith
the
Lord
,
but
to
the
convincing
them
of
my
word
,
which
shall
have
already
gone
forth
among
them
.
Wherefore
,
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
shall
write
;
and
the
fruit
of
the
loins
of
Judah
shall
write
;
and
that
which
shall
be
written
by
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
,
and
also
that
which
shall
be
written
by
the
fruit
of
the
loins
of
Judah
,
shall
grow
together
,
unto
the
confounding
of
false
doctrines
,
and
laying
down
of
contentions
,
and
establishing
peace
among
the
fruit
of
thy
Joins
,
and
bringing
them
to
the
knowledge
of
their
fathers
in
the
latter
days
;
and
also
to
the
knowledge
of
my
covenants
,
saith
the
Lord
.
And
out
of
weakness
he
shall'
be
made
strong
,
in
that
day
when
my
work
shall
commence
among
all
my
people
,
unto
the
restoring
thee
,
O
house
of
Israel
,
saith
the
Lord
.
And
thus
prophesied
Joseph
,
saying
:
Behold
,.
that
seer
will
the
Lord
bless
;
and
they
that
seek
to
destroy
him
,
shall
be
confounded
:
for
this
promise
,
of
which
I
have
obtained
of
the
Lord
,
of
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
,
shall
be
fulfilled
.
Behold
,
1
am
sure
of
the
fulfilling
of
this
promise
.
And
his
name
shall
be
called
after
me
;
and
it
shall
be
after
the
name
of
his
father
.
And
he
-
shall
be
like
unto
me
;
for
the
thing
which
the
Lord
shall
bring
forth
by
his
.
hand
,
by
the
power
of
the
Lord
shall
bring
my
people
unto
salvation
;
yea
,
thus
prophesied
Joseph
,
I
am
sure
of
this
thing
,
even
as
Iam
sure
-
of
the
promise
of
Moses
:
for
the
Lord
hath
said
unto
me
,
I
will
prese
:
ve
:
thy
seed
forever
.
And
the
Lord
hath
said
,
I
will
raise
-
up
a
.
Moses
;
and
I
will
give
.
power
unto
him
in
a
rod
;
and
I
will
give
judgement
unto
him
in
writing
.
Yet
I
will
not
loose
is
tongue
,
that
he
shall
speak
much
:
for
I
will
not
make
hiny
mighty
in
speaking
:
But
I
will
write
unto
him
my
law
,
by
the
finger
of
mine
own
hand
;
and
I
will
make
a
spokesman
for
him
.-
And
.
the
Lord
said
unto
me
also
;
I
will
raise
up
unto
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
;
and
I
will
make
for
him
a
aspokesman
.
And
I
,
behold
,
I
will
give
.
unto
.
him
,
'\that
lie
:
shall
write
the
writing
of
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
,
unto
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
;.
and
the
spokesman
of
thy
.
loins
shall
declare
it
...;
And
the
words
which
he
shall
write
,
shall
!
be
the
words
which
are
expedient
in
my
wisdom
,
should
go
forth
..
unto
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
...
And
it
shall
be
.
as
.
if
the
.
fruit
:
of
thy
loins
had
cried
:
unto
them
from
.
the
:
dust
:;:
for
I
know
:
their
faith
.
And
they
shall
,
cry
from
:
the
dust
;
yea
,
even
repentance
[File:071]
unto
their
brethren
,
even
afler
.
many
generations
have
gone
by
them
.
And
it
shalleome
to
pass
that
their
cry
shall
go
,
even
according
to
the
simpleness
of
their
words
.
Because
of
their
faith
,
their
words
shall
proceed
forth
out
of
my
mouth
unto
their
brethren
,
who
are
the
fruit
of
thy
loins
;
and
.
the
weakness
of
their
words
will
I
make
strong
in
their
faith
,
unto
the
remembering
of
my
covenant
which
I
made
unto
thy
fathers
.
And
now
,
behold
,
my
son
Joseph
,
after
this
manner
did
my
father
of
old
prophesy
.
Wherefore
,
because
of
this
covenant
thou
art
blessed
:
for
thy
seed
shall
not
be
destroyed
,
for
they
shall
hearken
unto
.
the
words
of
the
book
.
And
there
shall
raise
up
.
one
mighty
among
them
,
who
shall
do
much
good
,
both
in
word
and
in
deed
,
being
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
God
,
with
exceeding
faith
,
to
work
mighty
wonders
,
and
do
that
thing
which
is
great
in
the
sight
.
of
God
,
unto
the
bringing
to
pass
much
restoration
unto
the
house
of
Israel
,
and
unto
the
seed
of
thy
brethren
.
And
now
,
blessed
art
thou
,
Joseph
.
Behold
,
thou
art
little
;
wherefore
,
hearken
unto
..
the
words
of
thy
brother
Nephi
,
and
it
shall
be
done
unto
thee
,
even
according
to
the
words
which
I
have
spoken
.
Remember
the
words
of
thy
dying
father
.
Amen
,

CHAPTER
HI
.
_Anp
now
,
I
,
Nephi
,
speak
concerning
the
prophecies
of
which
my
father
hath
spoken
,
concerning
Jo+
seph
,
who
was
carried
into
Egypt
:
For
behold
,
he
truly
prophesied
concerning
all
his
seed
.
And
:
the
prophecies
which
he
wrote
,
there
are
not
many
greater
.
And
he
prophesied
concerning
us
,
and
our
future

erations
;
and
they
are
written
upon
the
plates
:
ofâ

brass
.
Wherefore
,
after
my
father
.
hadmadee'an'end
:
of
speaking
concerning
the
prophecies
of
Joseph
,
he
called
the
children
of
Laman
,
his
sons
,
and
his
daughters
,
and
said
unto
them
,
behold
,
my
sons
,
and
:
my
daughters
,
who
are
the
sons
and
the
daughters
of
my
first
born
,
I
would
that
:
ye
should
give
ear
unto
my
words
:
forthe
Lord
God
hath
said
,
that
inasmueh
-
as
[File:072]
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
;
and
inasmuch
as
ye
will
not
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
my
presence
.
But
behold
,
my
sons
and
my
daughters
,
cannot
go
down
to
my
grave
,
save
I
should
leave
a
blessing
upon
you
:
For
behold
,
I
know
that
if
ye
are
brought
up
in
the
way
ye
should
go
,
ye
will
not
depart
from
it
.
Wherefore
,
if
ye
are
cursed
,
behold
,
I
leave
my
blessing
upon
you
,
that
the
cursing
may
be
taken
from
you
,
and
be
answered
upon
the
heads
of
your
arents
.
Wherefere
,
because
of
my
blessing
,
the
ord
God
will
not
suffer
that
ye
shall
perish
;
wherefore
,
he
will
be
merciful
unto
you
,
and
unto
your
seed
forever
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
my
father
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
to
the
sons
and
:
daughters
of
Laman
,
he
caused
the
sons
and
daughters
of
Lemuel
to
be
brought
before
him
.
And
he
spake
unto
them
,
saying
:
Behold
,
my
sons
and
my
daughters
,
who
are
the
sons
and
the
daughters
of
my
second
son
;
behold
,
I
leave
unto
you
the
same
blessing
which
I
left
unto
the
sons
and
daughters
of
Laman
;
wherefore
,
thou
shalt
not'
utterly
be
destroyed
;
but
in
the
end
thy
seed
shall
be
blessed
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
my
father
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
them
,
behold
,
he
spake
unto
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
yea
,
and
even
all
his
household
.
And
after
he
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
them
,
he
spake
unto
Sam
,
saying
:
Blessed
art
thou
,
and
thy
seed
:

thou
shalt
inherit
the
land
,
like
unto
thy
brother
Nephi
.
And
.
thy
seed
shall
be
numbered
with
his
seed
;
and
thou
shalt
be
even
like
unto
thy
brother
,
and
thy
seed
like
unto
his
seed
;
and
thou
shalt
be
blessed
in
all
thy
days
.
And
it
came
to
pass
after
my
father
Lehi
had
spoken
unto
all
his
household
,
according
to
the
feelings
of
his
heart
,
and
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
which
was
in
him
,
he
waxed
old
.
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
he
died
,
and
was
buried
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
not
many
days
after
his
death
,
Laman
andLemuel
,
and
the
sons
of
:
Ishmael
,
were
angry
with
me
because
of
the
admonitions
of
the
Lord
:
for
I
,
Nephi
,
was
constrained
to
speak
unto
them
,
according
to
his
word
.
ForI
had
spake
many
things
unto
them
,
and
also
my
father
,
before
his
death
;
many
of
which
sayings
,
are
written
upon
mine
other
plates
:
for
a
more
history
part
are
written
[File:073]
upon
mine
other
plates
.
And
upon
these
,
I
write
the
things
of
my
soul
,
and
many
of
the
scriptures
which
are
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
:
For
my
soul
delighteth
in
the
scriptures
,
and
my
heart
pondereth
them
,
and
writeth
them
for
the
learning
and
the
profit
of
my
children
.
Behold
,
my
soul
delighteth
in
the
things
of
the
Lord
;
and
my
heart
pondereth
continually
upon
the
things
which
I
have
seen
and
heard
..
Nevertheless
,
the
great
goodness
of
the
Lord
,
in
shew
ing
me
his
great
and
marvellous
works
,
my
heart
exclaimeth
,
O
wretched
man
that]
am
;
yea
,
my
heart
sorroweth
because
of
my
flesh
.
My
soul
grieveth
because
of
mine
iniquities
.
I
am
encompassed
about
because
of
the
temptations
and
the
sing
which
doth
so
easily
beset
me
.
And
whenI
desire
to
rejoice
,
my
heart
groaneth
because
of
my
sins
;
nevertheless
,
f
know
in
whom
I
have
trusted
.
My
God
hath
.
been
my
support
;
he
hath
led
me
through
mine
afilictions
in
the
wilderness
;
and
he
hath
preserved
me
upon
the
waters
of
the
great
deep
.
He
hath
filled
me
with
his
love
,
even
unto
the
consuming
of
my
flesh
...
He
hath
confounded
mine
enemies
,
unto
the
causing
of
them
to
quake
before
me
.
Behold
,
he
hath
:
heard
my
cry
by
day
,
and
he
hath
given
me
knowledge
by
visions
in
the
night
time
,
And
by
day
have
I
waxed
bold
in
mighty
prayer
before
him
;
yea
,
my
voice
have
I
sent
up
on
high
;
and
angels
came
down
.
and
ministered
unto
me
.
And
upon
the
wings
of
his
spirit
hath
my
body
been
carried
away
upon
exceeding
high
mountains
.
And
mine
eyes
have
beheld
great
things
;
yea
,
even
too
great
for
man
;
therefore
I
was
bidden
that
I
should
not
write
them
.
O
then
,
if
I
have
seen
so
great
things
;
if
the
Lord
in
his
condescension
unto
the
children
of
nen
,
hath
visited
men
in
so
much
mercy
why
should
my
heart
weep
,
and
my
soul
linger
in
the
valley
of
sorrow
,
and
my
flesh
waste
away
,
and
my
strength
slacken
,
because
of
mine
afflictions
?.
And
why
should
[
yield
to
sin
,
because
of
my
flesh
?
Yea
,
why
should
I
give
way
to
temptations
,
that
the
evil
one
have
place
.
in
my
hawt
,
to
destroy

my

O
Lord
,
wilt
thou
redeem
my

Wilt
thou
deliver

me
out
of
the
hands

mine
enemies

Wilt
thou
make
me
that
I
may
shake
at

May
the
gates
of
hell
be
shut
continually
before

because
that

is
broken

is
contrite

O
Lord
,
wilt
thou
not
shut
the
gates
of
thy
righteousness
before
me
,
that
I
may
walk
in
the
path

O

O

wilt
thou

Wilt
thou
make
my
path
straight

Wilt
thou
not

But
that
thou
wouldest
clear
my
way
before
me
,
and
hedge
not
up
my
way

the
ways
of
of
mine
enemy

O
Lord
,
I
have
trusted
in
thee
,
and
I
will
trust
in
thee
forever

I
will
not
put
my

;
for
I
know
that
cursed
is
he
that
putteth
his
trust
in
the

Yea
,
cursed
:
is
he
that
putteth
his

or
maketh

Yea
,
I
know
that
God

give

to
him
that
asketh
.
Yea
,
my

give

,
if
I
ask
not

:
therefore
I

lift
up

CHAPTER
IV
.
Brnorp
,
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
cry
much
unto
the
Lord
my
God
,
because
of
the
anger
of
my
brethren
.
But
behold
,
their
anger
did
increase
against
me
;
insomuch
that
they
did
seek
to
take
away
my
life
.
Yea
,
they
did
murmur
against
me
,
saying
:
Our
younger
brother
thinks
to
rule
over
us
;
and
we
have
had
much
trial
because
of
him
;
wherefore
,
now
let
us
slay
him
,
that
we
may
not
be
afflicted
more
because
of
his
words
.
For
behold
,
we
will
not
have
him
to
be
our
ruler
:
for
it
belongs
unto
us
,
who
are
the
elder
brethren
,
to
ruleover
this
people
.
Now
I
do
not
write
upon
these
.
plates
,
all
the
words
.
which
:
[File:075]
they
murmured
against
me
.
But
it
sufficeth
mie
to
say
,
that
they
did
seek
to
take
away
my
life
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
warn
me
,
that
I
,
Nephi
,
should
depart
from
them
,
and
flee
into
the
wilderness
,
and
all
those
who
would
go
with
me
.
Wherefore
,
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
take
my
family
,
and
also
Zoram
and
his
family
,
and
Sam
,
mine
elder
brother
,
and
his
family
,
and
Jacob
and
Joseph
,
my
younger
brethren
,
and
also
my
sisters
,
and
all
those
who
would
go
with
me
.
And
all
those
who
would
go
with
me
,
were
those
who
believed
in
the
warnings
and
the
revelations
of
God
;
wherefore
,
they
did
hearken
unto
my
words
.
And
we
did
take
our
tents
and
whatsoever
things
were
possible
for
us
,
and
did
journey
in
the
wilderness
for
the
space
of
many
days
.
And
after
we
had
journied
for
the
space
of
many
days
,
we
did
pitch
our
tents
.
And
my
people
oa
that
we
should
call
the
name
of
the
place
Nephi
;
wherefore
,
we
did
call
it
Nephi
.
And
all
those
who
were
with
me
,
did
take
upon
them
to
call
themselves
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
we
did
observe
to
keep
the
judgments
,
and
the
statutes
,
and
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
,
in
all
things
,
according
to
the
law
of
Moses
.
And
the
Lord
was
with
us
;
and
we
did
prosper
exceedingly
:
for
we
did
sow
seed
,
and
we
did
reap
again
in
abundance
.
And
we
began
to
raise
flocks
,
and
herds
,
and
animals
of
every
kind
.
And
I
,
Nephi
,
had
also
brought
the
records
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
of
brass
;
and
also
the
ball
,
or
compass
,
which
was
prepared
for
my
father
,
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
according
to
that
which
is
written
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
began
to
prosper
exceedingly
,
and
to
multiply
in
the
land
.
And
I
,
Nephi
,
did
take
the
sword
of
Laban
,
and
after
the
manner
of
it
did
make
many
swords
,
lest
by
any
means
the
people
who
were
now
called
Lamanites
,
should
come
upon
us
and
destroy
us
:
for
I
knew
their
hatred
towards
me
and
my
children
,
and
those
who
were
called
my
people
.
And
I
did
teach
my
people
,
.
to
build
buildings
;
and
to
work
in
all
manner
of
wood
;
and
of
iron
,
and
of
copper
,
and
of
brass
,
and
of
steel
,
and
of
gold
,
and
of
silver
,
and
of
precious
ores
,
which
were
in
great
abundance
.
And
J
,
Nephi
,
did
builda
temple
;
and
I
did
construct
it
after
the
:
manner
of
the
temple
of
Solomon
,
save
it
were
not
built
of
so
many
precious
things
:
for
they
were
not
to
be
found
upon
the
land
;
wherefore
,
it
could
not
be
built
like
unto
[File:076]
Solomon's
temple
.
But
the
manner
of
the
construotion
was
like
unto
the
temple
of
Solomon
;
and
the
workmanship
thereof
was
exceeding
fine
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
cause
my
people
to
be
industrious
,
and
to
labor
with
their
hangs
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
would
that
I
should
be
their
king
.
But
I
,
Nephi
,
was
desirous
that
they
should
have
no
king
;
nevertheless
,
I
did
for
them
according
to
that
.
which
was
in
my
power
.
And
behold
,
the
words
of
the
Lord
had
been
fulfilled
unto
my
brethren
,
which
he
spake
concerning
them
,
that
-
I
should
be
their
ruler
and
their
teacher
;
wherefore
,
I
had
been
their
ruler
and
their
teacher
,
according
to
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
,
until
the
time
they
sought
to
take
away
my
life
.
Wherefore
,
the
word
of
the
Lord
was
fulfilled
which
he
spake
unto
me
,
saying
:
That
inasmuch
as
they
will
not
hearken
unto
thy
words
,
they
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
.
And
behold
,
they
were
cut
off
from
his
presence
.
And
he
had
caused
the
cursing
to
come
upon
them
,
yea
,
even
a
sore
cursing
,
because
of
their
iniquity
.
For
behold
,
they
had
hardened
their
hearts
against
him
,
that
they
had
become
like
unto
a
flint
;
wherefore
,
as
they
were
white
,
and
exceeding
fair
and
delightsome
,
that
they
might
not
be
enticing
unto
my
people
,
the
Lord
God
did
cause
a
skin
of
blackness
to
come
upon
them
.
And
thus
saith
the
Lord
God
,
I
will
cause
that
they
shall
be
loathsome
unto
thy
people
,
save
they
shall
repent
of
their
iniquities
.
And
cursed
shall
be
the
seed
of
him
that
mixeth
with
their
seed
:
for
they
shall
be
cursed
even
with
the
same
cursing
.
And
the
.
Lord
spake
it
,
and
it
was
done
..
And
because
of
their
cursing
which
was
upon
.
them
,
they
did
become
an
idle
people
,
full
of
mischief
and
subtlety
,
and
did
seek
in
the
wilderness
for
beasts
of
prey
.
And
the
Lord
God
said
unto
me
,
they
shall
be
a
scourge
unto
thy
seed
,
to
stir
them
up
in
remembrance
of
me
;
and
inasmuch
as
they
will
not
remember
me
,
and
hearken
unto
my
words
,
they
shall
scourge
them
even
unto
destruction
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Nephi
,
did
consecrate
Jacob
and
Joseph
,
that
they
should
be
priests
and
teachers
over
the
land
of
my
people
.
And
it
came
-
to
pass
that
.
we
lived
after
the
manner
of
happiness
..
Aad
thirty
years
had
passed
away
.
from
the
time
.
we
left
Jerusalem
.
And
-
I
,
Nephi
,
had
kept
the
records
[File:077]
upon
my
plates
,
which
I
had
made
of
my
people
,
thus
far
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
God
said
unto
me
,
make
other
plates
;
and
thou
shalt
engraven
many
.
things
upon
them
which
are
good
in
my
sight
,
for
the
profit
of
thy
people
..
Wherefore
,
I
Nephi
,
to
be
obedient
to
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
,
went
and
made
these
plates
upon
which
I
have
engraven
these
things
.
And
I
engraved
that
which
is
pleasing
unto
God
.
And
if
my
people
are
pleased
with
the
things
of
God
,
they
will
be
pleased
with
mine
engravings
which
are
upon
these
plates
.
And
if
my
people
desire
to
know
the
more
particular
part
of
the
history
of
my
people
,
they
must
search
mine
other
plates
.
And
it
sufficeth
me
to
say
,
that
forty
years
had
passed
away
,
and
we
had
already
had
wars
and
contentions
with
our
brethren
.

CHAPTER
V
.
Tue
words
of
Jacob
,
the
brother
of
Nephi
,
which
he
spake
unto
the
people
of
Nephi
:
Behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
Jacob
,
having
been
called
of
God
,
and
ordained
after
the
manner
of
his
holy
order
,
and
having
been
consecrated
by
my
brother
,
Nephi
,
unto
whom
ye
look
as
a
king
or
a
protector
,
and
on
whom
ye
depend
for
safety
,
behold
,
ye
know
that
I
have
spoken
unto
you
exceeding
many
things
;
nevertheless
,
I
speak
unto
you
again
;
for
I
am
desirous
for
the
welfare
of
your
souls
.
Yea
,
mine
anxiety
is
great
for
ou
;
and
ye
yourselves
know
that
it
ever
has
been
,
or
I
have
exhorted
you
with
all
diligence
;
and
I
have
taught
you
the
words
of
my
father
;
and
I
have
spoken
unto
you
concerning
all
things
which
are
written
,
from
the
creation
of
the
world
.
_
And
now
,
behold
,
I
would
speak
unto
you
concerning
things
which
are
,
and
which
are
to
come
;
wherefore
,
I
will
read
you
the
words
of
Isaiah
.
And
they
are
the
words
which
my
brother
has
desired
that
I
should
speak
unto
you
.
And
1
speak
unto
you
for
your
sakes
,
that
ye
may
learn
and
glorify
the
name
.
+
God
.
And
now
,
the
words
which
I
shall
,
are
they
which
Isaiah
spake
concerning
all
the
[File:078]
house
of
Israel
;
wherefore
,
they
may
be
likened
unto
you
:
for
ye
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
.
And
there
are
many
things
which
have
been
spoken
by
Isaiah
,
which
may
be
likened
unto
you
,
because
ye
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
.
And
now
,
these
are
the
words
:
Thus
saith
the
Lord
God
:
Behold
,
I
will
lift
up
mine
hand
to
the
Gentiles
,
and
set
up
my
standard
to
the
people
;
and
they
shall
bring
thy
sons
in
their
arms
,
and
thy
daughters
shall
be
carried
upon
their
shoulders
.
And
kings
shall
be
thy
nursing
fathers
,
and
their
queens
thy
nursing
mothers
:
they
shall
bow
down
to
thee
with
their
faces
towards
the
earth
,
and
lick
up
the
dust
of
thy
feet
;
and
thou
shalt
know
that
I
am
the
Lord
:
for
they
shall
not
be
ashamed
that
wait
for
me
.
And
now
J
,
Jacob
,
would
speak
somewhat
concerning
these
words
:
For
behold
,
the
Lord
has
shewn
-
me
that
those
who
were
at
Jerusalem
,
from
whence
we
came
,
have
been
slain
and
carried
away
captive
;
nevertheless
,
the
Lord
has
shewn
unto
me
that
they
should
return
again
,
And
.
he
also
has
shewn
unto
me
,
that
.
the
Lord
God
,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
should
manifest
himself
unto
them
in
the
flesh
;
and
after
he
should
manifest
himself
,
they
should
scourge
him
and
crucify
him
,
according
to
the
words
of
.
the
angel
,
who
spake
it
unto
me
.
And
after
they
have
hardened
their
hearts
and
stiffened
their
necks
against
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
behold
,
the
judgments
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
shall
come
upon
them
.
And
the
day
cometh
that
they
shall
be
smitten
and
afflicted
.
Wherefore
,
after
they
are
driven
to
and
fro
,
for
thus
saith
the
angel
,
many
shall
be
afflicted
in
the
flesh
and
shall
not
be
suffered
to
perish
,
because
.
of
the
prayers
of
the
faithful
,
they
shall
be
scattered
,
and
smitten
,
and
hated
;
nevertheless
,
the
Lord
will
be
merciful
unto
them
,
that
when
they
shall
come
to
the
knowledge
of
their
Redeemer
,
they
shall
be
gathered
together
again
to
the
lands
oftheir
inheritance
.
And
blessed
are
the
Gentiles
,
they
of
whom
the
prophet
has
written
:
for
behold
,
if
itso
be
that
they
shall
repent
and
fight
not
against
Zion
,
and
do
not
unite
themselves
to
that
great
and
abominable
church
,
they
shall
be
saved
:
for
the
LordGod
will
fulfil
his
covenants
which
he
has
made
unto
his
children}
and
for
this
cause
the
prophet
has
written
these
things
.
Wherefore
,
they
that
fight
against
Zion
and
the
covenant
people
of
the
Lord
,
shall
lick
up
the
dust
of
their
:
[File:079]
feet
;
and
the
people
of
the
Lord
shall
not
be
ashamed
.
For
the
people
of
the
Lord
are
they
who
wait
for
him
:
for
they
still
wait
for
the
coming
of
the
Messiah
.
And
behold
,
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophet
,
the
Messiah
will
set
himself
again
the
second
time
,
to
recover
them
;
wherefore
,
he
will
manifest
himself
unto
them
in
power
and
great
glory
,
unto
the
destruction
of
their
enemies
,
when
that
day
cometh
when
they
shall
believe
in
him
;
and
none
will
he
destroy
that
believe
in
him
.
And
they
that
believe
not
in
him
,
shall
be
destroyed
,
both
by
fire
,
and
by
tempest
,
and
by
earthquakes
,
and
by
bloodsheds
,
and
by
pestilence
,
and
by
famine
.
And
they
shall
know
that
the
Lord
is
God
,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
:
for
shall
the
prey
be
taken
from
the
mighty
,
or
the
lawful
captive
delivered
?
But
thus
saith
the
Lord
:
Even
the
captives
of
the
mighty
shall
be
taken
away
,
and
the
prey
of
the
terrible
shall
be
delivered
:
for
the
mighty
God
shall
deliver
his
covenant
people
.
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
:
I
will
contend
with
them
that
contendeth
with
thee
,
and
will
feed
them
that
oppress
thee
,
with
their
own
flesh
;
and
they
shall
be
drunken
with
their
own
blood
,
as
with
sweet
wine
;
and
all
flesh
shall
know
that
I
the
Lord
am
thy
Savior
and
thy
Redeemer
,
the
mighty
One
of
Jacob
.
Yea
,
for
thus
saith
the
Lord
:
Have
I
put
thee
away
,
or
have
I
cast
thee
off
forever
?
For
thus
saith
the
Lord
:
Where
is
the
bill
of
your
mother's
divorcement
?)
To
whom
have
put
thee
away
,
or
to
which
of
my
creditors
have
I
sold
yout
Yea
,
to
whom
have
I
sold
you
?
Behold
,
for
your
iniquities
have
ye
sold
yourselves
;
and
for
your
transgressions
is
your
mother
put
away
;
wherefore
,
when
I
came
,
there
was
no
man
;
when
I
called
,
yea
,
there
was
none
to
answer
,
O
House
of
Israel
,
is
my
hand
shortened
at
all
that
it
cannot
redeem
,
or
have
I
no
power
to
deliver
?
'
Behold
,
at
my
rebuke
,
I
dry
up
the
sea
,
I
make
their
rivers
a
wilderness
and
their
fish
to
stink
,
because
the
waters
are
dried
up
;
and
they
die
because
of
thirst
.
I
clothe
the
heavens
with
blackness
,
and
I
make
sackcloth
their
covering
.
The
Lord
God
hath
given
me
the
tongue
of
the
learned
,
that
I
should
know
how
to
speak
a
word
in
season
unto
thee
,
O
House
of
Israel
.
hen
ye
are
weary
,
he
waketh
morning
by
morning
.
He
waketh
mine
ear
to
hear
as
.
the
learned
.
The
Lord
God
hath
appointed
mine
ear
,
and
was
not
rebellious
,
neither
turned
away
back
.
I
gave
my
back
[File:080]
to
the
smiter
,
and
my
cheeks
to
them
that
plucked
off
the
hair
.
-
I
hid
not
my
face
from
shame
and
spitting
,
for
the
Lord
God
will
help
me
:
therefore
shall
I
not
be
confounded
.
Therefore
have
I
set
my
face
like
a
flint
,
and
I
know
that
I
shall
not
be
ashamed
;
and
the
Lord
is
,
near
,
and
he
justifieth
me
.
Who
.
will
contend
with
met
let
us
stand
together
.
Who
is
mine
adversary
?
let
him
come
near
me
,
andI
will
smite
him
with
the
strength
of
my
mouth
:
forthe
Lord
God
will
help
me
.
And
all
they
who
shall
condemn
me
,
behold
,
all
they
shall
wax
old
as
a
garment
,
and
the
moth
shall
eat
them
up
.
Who
is
among
you
that
feareth
the
Lord
;
that
obeyeth
the
voice
of
hig
servant
;
that
4valketh
in
darkness
,
and
hath
no
light
?
Behold
,
all
ye
that
kindle
fire
,
that
compass
yourselves
about
with
sparks
,
walk
in
the
.
light
of
your
fire
,
and
in
the
sparks
which
ye
have
kindled
.
This
shall
ye
have
of
mine
hand
:
Ye
shall
jie
down
in
sorrow
.
Hearken
unto
me
,
ye
that
follow
after
righteousness
:
Look
unto
the
rock
from
whence
ye
are
hewn
,
and
to
the
hole
of
the
pit
from
whence
ye
are
digged
.
Look
unto
Abraham
,
your
father
,
and
unto
Sarah
,
she
that
bare
you
:
for
I
called
him
alone
,
and
blessed
him
.
For
the
Lord
shall
comfort
Zien
:
he
will
comfort
all
her
waste
places
;
and
he
will
make
her
wilderness
like
Eden
,
and
her
desert
like
the
garden
of
the
Lord
.
Joy
and
gladness
shall
be
found
therein
,
thanksgiving
and
the
voice
of
melody
.
Hearken
unto
me
,
my
people
;
and
give
ear
unto
me
,
O
my
nation
:
:
for
a
law
shall
proceed
from
me
,
and
I
will
make
my
judgment
to
rest
for
a
light
for
the
people
.
My
righteousness
is
near
;
my
salvation
is
gone
forth
,
and
mine
arm
shall
judge
the
peeple
.
The
isles
shall
wait
upon
me
,
and
on
mine
arm
shall
they
trust
.
Lift
up
your
eyes
to
the
heavens
,
and
look
upon
the
earth
beneath
:
for
the
heavens
shall
vanish
away
like
smoke
,
and
the
earth
shall
wax
old
like
a
garment
;
and
they
that
dwell
therein
,
shall
die
in
like
manner
.
But
my
salvation
shall
be
forever
;
and
my
righteousness
shall
not
be
abolished
.
Hearken
unto
me
,
ye
that
know
righteousness
,
the
people
in
whose
heart
I
have
written
my
law
;
fear
ye
not
the
reproach
of
men
;
neither
be
ye
afraid
of
their
revilings
;
for
the
moth
shall
eat
them
up
like
a
garment
,
and
the
worm
shall
eat
them
.
like
wool
...,
But
my
righteousness
shall
be
forever
;
and
my
salvation
from
generation
to
generation
.
[File:081]
Awake
,
awake
!
Put
on
strength
O
arm
of
the
Lord
:
awake
as
in
the
ancient
days
,
Art
thou
nothe
that
hath
cut
Rahab
,
and
wounded
the
dragon
?
Art
thon
not
he
who
hath
dried
the
sea
,
the
waters
of
the
great
deep
;
that
hath
made
the
depths
of
the
scaa
way
for
the
ransomed
to
pass
over
!
Therefore
,
the
redeemed
of
the
Lord
shall
return
,
and
come
with
singing
unto
Zion
;
and
everlasting
joy
and
holiness
shall
be
upon
their
heads
;
and
they
sball
obtain
gladness
and
joy
:
sorrow
and
mourning
shall
flee
away
.
Iam
he
;
yea
,
I
am
he
that
comforteth
you
:
Behold
,
who
art
thou
,
that
thou_shouldest
be
afraid
of
man
,
who
shall
die
,
and
of
the
Son
of
man
,
who
shall
be
made
like
unto
grass
;
and
forgetest
the
Lord
thy
maker
,
that
hath
stretched
forth
the
heavens
,
and
laid
the
foundations
of
tae
earth
;
and
hast
feared
continnually
every
day
,
because
of
the
fury
of
the
oppressor
,
as
if
he
were
ready
to
destroy
?
And
where
is
the
fury
of
the
oppressor
?
The
captive
exile
hasteneth
,
that
he
may
be
loosed
,
and
that
he
should
not
die
in
the
pit
,
nor
that
his
bread
should
fail
.
But
I
am
the
Lord
thy
God
,
whose
waves
roared
:
the
Lord
of
Hosts
is
my
name
.
And
[
have
put
my
words
in
thy
mouth
,
and
have
covered
thee
in
the
shadow
of
mine
hand
,
that
I
may
plant
the
heavens
and
lay
the
foundations
of
the
earth
,
and
say
unto
Zion
,
Behold
,
thou
art
my
people
.
Awake
,
awake
,
stand
up
,
O
Jerusalem
,
which
hast
drunk
at
the
hand
of
the
Lord
the
cup
of
his
fury
;
thou
hast
drunken
the
dregs
of
the
cup
of
trembling
rung
out
;
and
none
to
guide
her
among
all
the
sons
she
hath
brought
forth
;
neither
that
taketh
her
by
the
-
hand
,
of
all
the
sons
she
hath
brought
up
.
.
These
two
sons
are
.
come
unto
thee
;
who
shall
be
sorry
for
thee
:
thy
desolation
and
destruction
,
and
the
famine
and
the
sword
:
And
by
whom
shall
[
comfort
thee
?
Thy
sons
have
fainted
,
save
these
two
:
they
lie
at
the
head
of
all
the
streets
,
as
a
wild
bull
ina
net
:
they
are
full
of
the
fury
of
the
Lord
,
the
rebuke
of
thy
God
.
Therefore
hear
now
this
,
thou
afflicted
,
and
drunken
,
and
not
with
wine
:
thus
saith
thy
Lord
,
the
Lord
and
thy
God
pleadeth
the
cause
of
his
people
,
Behold
,
I
have
taken
out
of
thine
hand
the
cup
of
trembling
,
the
dregs
.
of
the
cup
of
my
fury
;
thou
shalt
no
more
drink
it
again
...
But
.
I
will
put
it
.
into
:
the
hand'
of
them
thatafflict
thee
;
:
who
have
said
-
to
thy
soul
,
Bow
down
,
that
we
may
go
over
:
and
thou
hast~Jaid
thy
[File:082]
body
as
the
ground
,
and
as
the
street
to
them
that
went
over
.
Awake
,
awake
,
put
on
thy
strength
,
O
Zion
;
put
on
thy
beautiful
garments
,
Jerusalem
,
the
holy
city
:
for
henceforth
there
shall
no
more
come
into
thee
,
the
uncircumcised
-
and
the
unclean
.
Shake
thyself
from
the
dust
;
arise
,
sit
down
,
O
Jerusalem
:
loose
thyself
from
the
bands
of
thy
neck
,
O
captive
daughter
of
Zion
.
.
CHAPTER
VI
.
Axp
now
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
have
read
these
things
that
ye
might
know
concerning
the
covenants
of
the
Lord
;
that
he
has
covenanted
with
all
the
house
of
Israel
;
that
he
has
spoken
unto
the
Jews
,
by
the
mouth
of
his
holy
prophets
,
even
from
the
beginning
down
,
from
generation
to
generation
,
until
the
time
comes
that
they
shall
be
restored
to
the
true
church
and
fold
of
God
;
when
they
shall
be
gathered
home
to
the
lands
of
their
inheritance
,
and
shall
be
established
in
all
their
lands
of
promise
.
Behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
speak
unto
you
these
things
that
ye
may
rejoice
,
and
lift
up
your
heads
forever
,
because
of
the
blessings
which
the
Lord
God
shall
bestow
upon
your
children
.
For
I
know
that
ye
have
searched
much
,
many
of
you
,
to
know
of
things
to
come
;
wherefore
I
know
that
ye
know
that
our
flesh
must
waste
away
and
die
;
nevertheless
,
in
our
bodies
we
shall
see
God
.
Yea
,
I
know
that
ye
know
,
that
in
the
body
he
shall
shew
himself
unto
those
at
Jerusalem
,
from
whence
we
came
;
for
it
is
expedient
that
it
should
be
among
them
;
for
it
behoveth
the
great
Creator
that
he
suffereth
himself
to
become
subject
unto
man
in
the
flesh
,
and
die
for
all
men
,
that
all
men
might
become
subject
unto
him
..
For
as
death
hath
passed
upon
all
men
,
to
fulfil
the
merciful
plan
of
the
great
Creator
,
there
must
needs
be
a
power
of
resurrection
,
and
the
resurrection
must
needs
come
unto
man
by
reason
of
the
fall
;
and'
the
fall
came
by
reagonof
transgression
;
and
because'
man
became
fallen
,
they
were
cut
off
.
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
;
wherefore
it
must
needs
be
an
infinite
[File:083]
atonement
;
save
it
should
be
an
infinite
atonement
,
this
corruption
could
not
put
on
incorruption
.
Where
fore
,
the
first
judgment
which
came
upon
man
,
must
needs
have
remained
to
an
endless
duration
.
And
if'
so
,
this
flesh
must
have
laid
down
to
rot
and
to
crum
ble
to
its
mother
earth
,
to
rise
no
more
.
O
the
wisdom
of
God
!
his
merey
and
grace
!
For
behold
,
if
the
flesh
should
rise
no
more
,
our
spirits
must
become
subject
to
that
angel
who
fell
.
irom
before
the
presence
of
the
eternal
God
,
and
became
the
devil
,
to
rise
no
more
.
And
our
spirits
must
have
become
like
unto
him
,
and
we
become
devils
,
angels'to
a
devil
,
to
be
shut
out
from
the
presence
of
our
God
,
and
to
remain
with
the
father
of
lies
,
in
misery
,
like
unto
himself
;
yea
,
to
that
being
who
beguiled
our
first
parents
;
who
transformeth
himself
nigh
unto
an
.
angel
of
light
,
and
stireth
up
the
children
of
men
unto
secret
combinations
of
murder
,
and
all
manner
of
secret
works
of
darkness
.
O
how
great
the
goddness
of
our
God
,
who
prepareth
a
way
for
our
escape
from
the
grasp
of
this
awful
monster
;
yea
,
that
monster
,
death
and
hell
,
which
I
:
call
the
death
of
the
body
,
and
also
the
death
of
the
spirit
.
And
because
of
the
way
of
deliverance
of
our
God
,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
this
death
,
of
which
I
have
spoken
,
which
is
the
temporal
,
shall
deliver
u
its
dead
;
which
death
is
the
grave
.
And
this
deat
of
which
I
have
spoken
,
which
is
the
spiritual
death
,
shall
deliyer
up
its
dead
;
which
spiritual
death
is
hell
;
wherefore
,
death
and
hell
must
deliver
up
their
dead
,
and
hell
must
deliver
up
its
captive
spirits
,
and
the
grave
must
deliver
up
its
captive
bodies
,
and
the
bodies
and
the
spirits
of
men
will
be
restored
,
one
to
the
other
:
and
it
is
by
the
power
of
the
resurrection
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
.
.
Â©
how
great
the
plan
of
our
God
!
For
on
the
other
hand
,
the
paradise
of
God
must
deliver
up
the
spirits
of
the
righteous
,
and
the
grave
deliver
up
the
body
of
the
righteous
;
and
the
spirit
and
the
body
is
restored
to
itself
again
,
and
all
men
become
incorruptible
,
and
immortal
,
and
they
are
living
souls
,
having
a
perfect
knowledge
like
unto
us
,.
in
the
flesh
;
save
it
be
that
our
knowledge
shall
be
perfect
;
wherefore
,
we
shall
have
a
perfect
knowledge
of
all
our
guilt
,
and
our
uncleanness
,
and
our
nakedness
;
and
the
righteous
shall
have
a
:
perfect
knowldege'
of
their
enjoy
[File:084]
ment
,
and
their
righteousness
,
being
clothed
with
putity
,
yea
,
even
with
the
robe
of
righteousness
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
,
that
when
all
men
shall
have
passed
from
this
first
death
unto
life
,
insomuch
as
they
have
become
immortal
,
they
must
appear
before
the
judgment
seat
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
;
and
then
cometh
the
judgment
,
and
then
must
they
be
judged
according
to
the
holy
judgment
of
God
.
And
assuredly
,
as
the
Lord
liveth
,
for
the
Lord
God
hath
spoken
it
,
and
it
is
his
eternal
word
,
which
.
cannnot
pass
away
,
that
they
who
are
righteous
,
shall
be
righteous
still
,
and
they
who
are
filthy
,
shall
be
filthy
still
;
wherefore
,
they
who
are
filthy
,
are
the
devil
and
his
angels
;
and
they
shall
go
away
into
everlasting
fire
,
prepared
four
them
;
and
their
torment
is
as
a
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
,
whose
flames
ascendeth
up
forever
and
ever
,
and
has
no
end
.
O
the
greatness
and
the
justice
of
our
God
!
For
he
executeth
al]
his
words
,
and
they
have
gone
forth
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
his
law
must
be
fulfilled
.
But
,
behold
,
the
righteous
,
the
saints
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
they
who
have
believed
in
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
;
they
who
have
endured
the
crosses
of
the
world
,
and
despised
the
shame
of
it
;
they
shall
inherit
the
kingdom
of
God
,
which
was
prepared
for
them
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
:
and
their
joy
shall
be
full
forever
.
O
the
greatness
of
the
mercy
of
our
God
,
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
!
'
For
he
delivereth
his
saints
from
that
awful
monster
the
devil
,
and
death
and
hell
,
and
that
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
,
which
is
endless
torment
.
O
how
great
the
holiness
of
our
God
!
For
he
knoweth
all
things
,
and
there
is
not
any
thing
,
save
he
knows
it
.
And
-
he
cometh
into
the
world
that
he
may
save
all
men
,
if
they
will
hearken
unto
his
voice
:
for
behold
,
he
suffereth
the
pains
of
all
.
men
;
yea
,
the
pains
of
every
hving
creature
,
both
.
men
women
and
children
,
who
belong
to
the
family
of
Adam
,
And
he
suffereth
this
,
that
the
resurrection
might
pass
upon
all
men
,
that
all
might
stand
before
him
,
at
.
the
great
and
judgment
day
.
And
he
commandeth
all
men
that
they
must
repent
,
and
be
baptised
in
his
name
,
having
perfect
faith
in
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
or
they
cannot
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
God
.
And
if
they
will
not
repent
and
believe
.
in
,,
his
.
name
,
,
and
be
baptised
in
his
name
,
and
:
-
endure
-
to
the
end
)
they
must
be
damned
;
for
the
Lord
God
,
the
Holy
One
of
[File:085]
Israel
has
spoken
it
;
wherefore
he
has
given
a
law
;
and
where
there
is
no
law
given
,
there
is
no
punishment
;
and
where
there
is
no
punishment
,
there
isno
condemnation
;
and
where
there
is
no
condemnation
,
the
mercies
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
have
claim
upon
them
,
because
of
the
atonement
:
for
they
are
delivered
by
the
power
of
him
:
for
the
atonement
satisfieth
the
demands
of
his
justice
upon
all
those
who
have
not
the
law
given
to
them
,
that
they
are
delivered
from
that
awful
monster
,
death
and
hell
,
and
the
devil
,
and
the
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
,
which
is
endless
torment
;
and
they
are
restored
to
that
God
:
who
gave
them
breath
,
which
is
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
.
But
wo
unto
him
that
has
the
law
given
;
yea
,
that
has
all
the
commandments
of
God
,
like
unto
us
,
and
that
transgresseth
them
,
and
that
wasteth
the
days
of
his
probation
;
for
awful
is
his
state
!
O
that
cunning
plan
of
the
evil
one
!
O
the
vainness
,
and
the
frailties
,
and
the
foolishness
of
men
!
When
they
are
learned
,
they
think
they
are
wise
,
and
they
hearken
not
unto
the
counsel
of
God
,
for
they
set
it
aside
,
supposing
they
know
of
themselves
..
wherefore
,
their
wisdom
is
foolishness
,
and
it
profiteth
them
not
,
And
they
shall
perish
.
But
to
be
learned
is
good
,
if
they
hearken
unto
the
counsels
of
God
.
But
wo
unto
the
rich
,
who
are
rich
as
to
the
things
of
the
world
,
For
because
they
are
rich
,
they
despise
the
poor
,
and
they
persecute
the
meek
,
and
their
hearts
are
upon
their
treasures
:
wherefore
their
treasure
is
their
God
.
And
behold
,
their
treasure
shall
perish
with
them
also
.
And
wo
unto
the
deaf
,
that
will
not
hear
:
for
they
shall
perish
..
Wo
unto
the
blind
,
that
will
not
see
:
for
they
shall
perish
also
.
Wo
unto
the
uncircumcised
of
heart
:
for
a
knowledge
of
their
iniquities
shall
smite
them
at
the
last
day
.
Wo
unto
the
liar
:
for
he
shall
be
thrust
down
to
hell
.
Wo
unto
the
murderer
,
who
delibererately
killeth
:
for
he
shall
die
.
Wo
unte
them
who
commit
whoredoms
:
for
they
shall
be
thrust
down
to
hell
.
Yea
,
wo
unto
those
that
worship
idols
:
for
the
devil
of
all
devils
delighteth
in
them
.
And
,
in
fine
,
wo
unto
all
those
who
die
in
their
sins
:
for
they
shall
return
to
God
,
and
behold
his
face
,
and
remain
in
their
sins
,
O
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
remember
the
awfulness
in
transgressing
against
that
holy'God
,
and
also
the
awfulness
of
yielding
to
the
enticings
of
that
cunning
[File:086]
one
.
Remember
,
to
be
carnally
minded
,
is
death
,
and
to
be
spiritually
minded
,
is
life
eternal
.
O
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
give
ear
to
my
words
..
Remember
the
greatness
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
.
Do
not
say
that
I
have
spoken
hard
things
against
ou
:
for
if
ye
do
,
ye
will
revile
against
the
truth
:
for
i
hiave
spoken
the
words
of
your
Maker
.
I
know
that
the
words
of
truth
are
hard
against
all
wncleanness
;
but
the
righteous
fear
them
not
,
for
they
love
the
truth
,
and
are
not
shaken
.
O
then
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
come
unto
the
Lord
,
the
Holy
One
.
Remember
that
his
paths
are
rightous
.
Behold
,
the
way
for
man
is
narrow
,
but
it
lieth
in
a
straight
course
before
him
,
and
the
keeper
of
the
gate
is
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
:
and
he
employeth
no
servant
there
;
and
there
is
none
other
way
,
save
it
be
by
the
gate
,
for
he
cannot
be
deceived
;
for
the
Lord
God
is
his
name
.
And
whoso
knocketh
,
to
him
will
he
open
;
and
the
wise
,
and
the
learned
,
and
they
that
are
rich
,
who
are
puffed
up
because
of
their
learning
,
and
their
wisdom
,
and
their
riches
;
yea
,
they
are
they
,
whom
he
despiseth
;
and
save
they
shall
cast
these
things
away
,
and
consider
themselves
fools
before
God
,
and
come
down
in
the
depths
of
humility
,
he
will
not
open
unto
them
.
But
the
things
of
the
wise
and
the
prudent
,
shall
be
hid
from
them
forever
;
yea
,
that
happiness
which
is
prepared
for
the
saints
.
O
my
beloved
brethren
,
remember
my
words
:
Behold
,
I
take
off
my
garments
and
I
shake
them
before
you
:
I
pray
the
God
of
my
salvation
that
he
view
me
with
his
All
-
searching
eye
;
wherefore
,
ye
shall
know
at
the
last
day
,
when
all
men
shall
be
judged
of
their
works
,
that
the
God
of
Israel
did
witness
that
I
shook
your
iniquities
from
my
soul
,
and
that
I
stand
with
brightness
before
him
,
and
am
rid
of
your
blood
.
my
beloved
brethren
,
turn
away
from
your
sins
;
shake
off
the
chains
of
him
that
would
bind
you
fast
;
come
unto
that
God
who
is
the
rock
of
your
salvation
.
Prepare
your
souls
for
that
glorious
day
,
when
justice
shall
be
administered
unto
the
righteous
;
even
the
day
of
judgment
,
that
ye
may
not
shrink
with
awful
fear
;
that
ye
may
not
remember
your
awful
guilt
in
perfectness
,
and
be
constrained
to
exclaim
,
holy
,
-
holy
are
thy
judgments
,
O
Lord
God
Almighty
.
But
I
know
my
guilt
;
I
transgressed
thy
law
,
and
my
trans=
are
mine
;
and
the
devil
had
.
obtained
.
me
,
that
Iam
a
prey
to
his
awful
misery
.
But
behold
,
my
[File:087]
brethren
,
is
it
expedient
that
I
should
awake
you
to
an
awful
reality
of
these
things
?
Would
I
harrow
up
your
souls
,
if
your
minds
were
pure
?
Would
I
be
plain
unto
you
according
to
the
plainness
of
the
truth
,
if
ye
were
freed
from
sin
?
Behold
,
if
ye
were
holy
,
I
would
speak
unto
you
of
holiness
;
but
as
ye
are
not
holy
,
and
ye
look
upon
me
asa
teacher
,
it
must
needs
be
expedient
that
I
teach
you
the
consequences
of
sin
.
Behold
,
my
soul
abhorreth
sin
,
and
my
heart
delighteth
in
righteousness
;
and
I
will
praise
the
holy
name
of
my
God
.
Come
,
my
brethren
,
every
one
that
thirsteth
,
come
ye
to
the
waters
;
and
he
that
hath
ne
money
,
come
buy
and
eat
;
yea
,
come
buy
wine
and
milk
without
money
and
without
price
.
.
Wherefore
,
do
not
spend
money
for
that
which
:
is
of
no
worth
,
nor
your
labor
for
that
which
cannot
satisfy
.
Hearken
diligently
unto
me
,
and
remember
the
words
which
I
have
spoken
;
and
come
unto
the
Hol
One
of
Israel
,
and
feast
upon
that
whieh
perishet
not
,
neither
cam
be
corrupted
,
and
let
your
soul
delight
in
fatness
.
Behold
,
nsy
beloved
brethren
,
-
remember
the
words
of
your
God
;
pray
unto
him
continually
by
day
,
and
give
thanks
unto
his
holy
name
by
night
.
Let
your
hearts
rejoice
,
and
behold
how
great
the
covenants
of
the
Lord
,
and
how
great
his
condescensions
unto
the
children
of
men
;
and
because
of
his
greatness
,
and
his
grace
and
mercy
,
he
has
premised
unto
us
that
our
seed
shall
not
utterly
bedestroyed
,
according
to
the
flesh
,
but
that
he
would
preserve
them
;
and
in
future
generations
,
they
shall
become
a
righteous
branch
unto
the
house
of
Israel
.
And
now
,
my
brethren
,
I
would
speak
unte
you
more
;
but
on
the
morrow
I
will
declare
unto
you
the
remaindey
of
my
words
.
Amen
,
.
CHAPTER
VII
.
AnD
now
I
,
Jacob
,
speak
unto
you
again
,
my
beloyed
brethren
,
concerning
this
righteous
branch
of
which
I
have
spoken
.
For
behold
,
the
promises
which
we
have
obtained
,
are
promises
unto
us
according
to
the
flesh
;
wherefore
,
as
it
has
been
shown
unto
me
[File:088]
that
many
of
our
children
shall
perish
in
the
flesh
,
beeause
of
unbelief
,
nevertheless
,
God
will
be
merciful
unte
many}
and
our
children
shall
be
restored
,
that
they
may
come
to
that
which
will
give
them
the
true
knowledge
of
their
Redeemer
.
Wherefore
as
I
said
unto
you
,
it
must
needs
be
expedient
that
Christ
,
(
for
in
the
last
night
the
angel
spake
unto
me
that
this
should
be
his
name
,)
should
come
among
the
Jews
,
among
those
who
are
the
more
wicked
part
of
the
world
;
and
they
shall
crucify
him
:
For
thus
it
behooveth
our
God
;
and
there
is
none
other
nation
on
earth
that
would
crucify
their
God
.
For
should
the
mighty
miracles
be
wrought
among
other
nations
,
they
would
repent
,
and
,
know
that
he
be
their
God
;
but
because
of
priest
-
crafts
and
iniquities
,
they
at
Jerusalem
will
stiffen
their
necks
against
him
,
that
he
be
crucified
.
Wherefore
,
because
of
their
iniquities
,
destructions
,
famines
,
pestilences
,
and
bloodsheds
,
shall
come
upon
them
;
and
they
who
shall
not
be
destroyed
,
shall
be
scattered
among
all
nations
.
But
behold
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
God
:
When
the
day
cometh
that
they
shall
believe
in
.
me
,
that
Iam
Christ
,
then
have
I
covenanted
with
their
fathers
that
they
siall
be
restored
in
the
flesh
,
upon
the
earth
,
unto
the
lands
of
their
inheritance
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
they
shall
be
gathered
in
from
theirlong
dispersion
,
from
the
isles
of
the
sea
,
and
.
from
the
four
parts
of
the
eartli
;
and
the
nations
of
the
Gentiles
shall
be
great
in
the
eyes
of
me
,
saith
God
,
in
carrying
thein
forth
to
the
lands
of
their
inheritance
.
Yea
,
the
kings
of
the
Gentiles
shall
be
nursing
fathers
unto
them
,
and
their
queens
shall
become
nursing
mothers
;
wherefore
,
the
promises
ofthe
Lord
are
great
unto
the
Gentiles
,
for
he
hath
spoken
it
,
and
who
can
dispute
?
But
behold
,
this
land
,
saith
God
,
shall
be
a
land
of
thine
inheritance
;
and
the
Gentiles
shall
be
blessed
upon
tne
land
.
And
this
land
shall
be
a
land
of
liberty
unto
the
Gentiles
;
and
there
shall
be
no
kings
upon
the
land
,
wo
shall
raise
up
unto
the
Gentiles
,.
And
I
will
fortify
this
land
against
all
other
nations
;
and
he
that
fighteth
against
Zion
,
shall
perish
,
saith
God
:
for
he
that
raiseth
up
a
king
against
me
,
shall
perish
.
For
the
Lord
,
tne
king
of
heaven
,
will
be
their
king
;
and
I
will
be
alight
unto
them
forever
,
that
hear
my
words
.
Wherefore
,
for
this
cause
,
that
my
covenants
may
be
fulfilled
,
which
I
have
made
un
[File:089]
to
the
children
of
men
,
that
I
will
do
unto
them
while
they
are
in
the
flesh
,
1
nxust
needs
destroy
the
secret
works
of
darkness
,
and
of
murders
,
and
of
abominations
;
wherefore
,
he
that
fighteth
against
Zion
,
both
Jew
and
Gentile
,
both
bond
and
free
,
both
male
and
female
,
shall
perish
:
for
they
are
they
who
are
the
whore
of
all
the
earth
;
for
they
who
are
not
for
me
,
are
against
me
,
saith
our
God
.
For
I
will
fulfil
my
promises
which
have
made
unto
the
children
of
men
,
that
I
will
do
unto
them
while
they
are
in
the
flesh
..
Wherefore
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
thus
saith
our
God
:
I
will
afflict
thy
seed
by
the
hand
of
the
Gentiies
;
nevertheless
,
I
will
soften
the
hearts
of
the
Gentiles
,
that
they
shall
be
like
unto
4
father
to
them
;
wherefore
,
the
Gentiles
shall
be
blessed
and
numbered
among
the
house
of
Israel
.
Wherefore
,
I
will
consecrate
this
land
unto
thy
seed
and
they
who
shall
be
numbered
among
thy
seed
,
forever
,
for
the
land
of
theif
inheritance
:
For
itis
a
choice
land
,
saith
God
unto
me
,
above
all
other
lands
;
wherefore
,
I
will
have
all
men
that
dwell
thereon
,
that
they
shall
worship
me
,
saith
God
.
And
now
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
seeing
that
our
merciful
God
has
given
us
so
great
knowledge
concerning
these
things
,
let
us
remember
him
,
and
lay
aside
our
sins
,
and
not
hang
down
our
heads
,
for
we
are
not
cast
off
;
nevertheless
,
we
have
been
driven
out
of
the
land
of
our
inheritance
;
but
we
have
been
led
to
a
better
land
:
for
the
Lord
has
made
the
sea
our
path
,
and
we
are
upon
an
isle
of
the
sea
.
But
great
are
the
promises
of
the
Lord
unto
they
whoare
upon
the
isles
of
the
sea
;
wherefore
,
as
it
says
isles
,
there
must
needs
be
more
than
this
;
and
they
are
inhabited
also
by
our
brethren
.
For
behold
,
the
Lord
God
has
led
away
from
time
to
time
from
the
-
house
of
Israel
,
according
to
his
will
and
pleasure
.
And
now
,
behold
,
the
Lord
remembereth
all
they
who
have
been
broken
off
;
wherefore
,
he
remembereth
us
also
.
Therefore
cheer
up
your
hearts
,
and
remember
that
ye
are
free
to
act
for
yourselves
:
to
choose
the
way
of
everlasting
death
,
or
the
way
of
eternal
life
.
Wherefore
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
reconcile
yourselves
to
the
will
of
God
,
and
not
.
to
the
will
of
the
devil
and
the
flesh
;
and
remember
after
ye
are
reconciled
unto
God
,
that
it
is
only
in
and
through
the
grace
of
God
that
ye
are
saved
.
Wherefore
,
may
God
raise
you
from
death
,
by
[File:090]
the
power
of
the
resurrection
;
and
also
from
everlasting
death
,
by
the
power
of
the
atonement
,
that
ye
may
be
received
into
the
eternal
kingdom
of
God
,
that
ye
may
praise
him
through
grace
divine
.
Amen
.
CHAPTER
VIII
.
Any
now
Jacob
spake
many
more
things
to
my
people
at
that
time
;
nevertheless
,
only
these
things
have
#
caused
to
be
written
:
for
the
things
which
I
have
written
,
sufficeth
me
.
And
now
IJ
,
Nephi
,
write
more
of
the
words
of
Ysaiah
:
for
my
soul
delighteth
in
his
words
.
For
I
will
likeri
his
words
unto
my
people
;
and
I
will
send
them
forth
unto
all
my
children
:
for
he
verily
saw
my
Redeemer
,
even
as
I
have
seen
him
.
And
my
brother
Jacob
also
has
seen
him
as
1
have
seen
him
;
wherefore
,
I
will
send
their
words
forth
unto
my
children
,
to
prove
unto
them
that
my
words
are
true
.
Wherefore
,
by
the
words
of
three
,
God
hath
said
,
I
will
establish
my
word
.
Nevertheless
,
God
sendeth
more
witnesses
;
and
he
proveth
all
his
words
.
Behold
,
my
soul
delighteth
in
proving
unto
my
people
the
truth
of
the
coming
of
Christ
:
for
,
for
this
end
hath
the
law
of
Moses
been
given
;
and
all
things
which
have
been
given
of
God
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
,
unto
man
,
are
the
typifying
of
him
.
And
also
,
my
soul
delighteth
in
the
covenants
of
the
Lord
which
he
hath
made
to
our
fathers
;
yea
,
my
soul
delighteth
in
his
grace
,
and
his
justice
,
and
power
,
and
mercy
,
in
the
great
and
eternal
plan
of
deliverance
from
death
.
And
my
soul
delighteth
in
proving
unto
my
people
,
that
save
Christ
should
come
,
all
men
must
perish
.
For
if
there
be
no
Christ
,
there
be
no
God
;
and
if
there
be
no
God
,
we
are
not
,
for
there
could
have
been
no
ecreation
.
But
there
is
a
God
,
and
he
is
Christ
;
and
he
cometh
in
the
fulness
of
his
own
time
.
And
now
-
I
write
some
of
the
words
of
Isaiah
,
that
whoso
of
my
people
shall
see
these
words
,
may
lift
up
their
hearts
and
rejoice
for
all
men
.
Now
,
these
are
the
words
;
and
ye
may
liken
them
unto
you
,
and
unto
all
men
.
[File:091]
The
word
that
Isaiah
,
the
son
of
Amoz
,
saw
,
concerning
Judah
and
Jerusalem
:
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
the
last
days
,
when
the
mountain
of
the
Lord's
house
shall
be
established
in
the
top
of
the
mountains
,
and
shall
be
exalted
above
the
hills
,.
and
all
nations
shall
flow
unto
it
,
and
many
people
shall
go
and
say
,
Come
ye
,
and
let
us
go
up
to
the
mountain
of
the
Lord
,
to
the
house
of
the
God
of
Jacob
;
and
he
will
teach
us
of
his
ways
,
and
we
will
walk
in
his
paths
:
for
out
of
Zion
shall
go
forth
the
law
,
and
the
word
of
the
Lord
from
Jerusalem
.
And
he
shall
judge
among
the
nations
,
and
shall
rebuke
many
people
:
and
they
shall
beat
their
swords
into
plough
-
shares
,
and
their
spears
into
pruning
hooks
:
nation
shall
not
lift
up
sword
against
nation
,
neither
shall
they
learn
war
any
more
.
O
house
of
Jacob
,
come
ye
-
and
let
us
walk
in
the
light
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
come
,
for
ye
have
all
gone
astray
,
every
one
to
his
wicked
ways
.
Therefore
,
O
Lord
,
thou
hast
forsaken
thy
people
,
the
house
of
Jacob
,
because
they
be
replenished
from
the
east
,
and
hearken
unto
soothsayers
like
the
Philistines
,
and
they
please
themselves
in
the
children
of
strangers
.
Their
land
also
is
full
of
silver
and
gold
,
neither
is
there
any
end
of
their
treasures
;
their
land
is
also
full
of
horses
,
neither
is
there
any
end
of
their
chariots
:
their
land
also
is
full
of
idols
;
they
worship
the
work
of
their
own
hands
,.
that
which
their
own
fingers
have
made
:
and
the
mean
man
boweth
not
down
,
and
the
great
man
humbleth
himself
not
:
there
fore
forgive
him
not
.
O
ye
wicked
ones
,
enterinto
the
rock
,
and
hide
thee
in
the
dust
,
for
the
fear
of
the
Lord
,
and
the
glory
of
his
majesty
shall
smite
thee
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
lofty
looks
of
man
shall
be
humbled
,
and
the
haughtiness
of
men
shall
be
bowed
down
,
and
the
Lord
alone
shall
-
be
exalted
in
that
day
.
For
the
day
of
the
Lord
of
hosts
soon
cometh
upon
all
nations
;
yea
,
upon
every
one
;
yea
,
upon
the
proud
and
lofty
,
and
upon
every
one
who
is
lifted
up
;
and
he
shall
be
brought
low
:
yea
,
and
the
day
of
the
Lord
shall
come
upon
all
the
cedars
of
Lebanon
,
for
they
are
high
and
lifted
up
:
and
upon
all
the
oaks
of
Bashan
,
and
upon
all
the
high
mountains
,
and
upon
all
the
hills
,
and
upon
all
the
nations
which
are
lifted
up
,
and
upon
every
people
,
and
upon'
every
high
tower
,
and
upon
every
fenced
wall
,
and
upon
all
the
ships
of
the
sea
;
and
upon
all
the
ships
of
Tarshish
,
and
upon
all
pleasant
[File:092]
pictures
.
And
the
loftiness
of
man
shall
be
bowed
down
,
and
the
haughtiness
of
men
shall
be
made
low
:
and
the
Lord
alone
shall
be
exaltedin
that
day
.
And
the
idols
he
shall
utterly
abolish
...
And
they
shall
go
into
the
holes
of
the
rocks
,
and
into
the
caves
of
the
earth
,
for
the
fear
of
the
Lord
shall
come
upon
them
;
and
the
glory
of
his
majesty
shall
smite
them
,
when
he
ariseth
to
shake
terribly
the
earth
.
In
that
day
.
a
man
shall
cast
his
idols
of
silver
,
and
his
idols
of
gold
,
which
he
hath
made
for
himself
to
worship
,
to
the
moles
and
to
the
bats
;
to
go
into
the
clefts
of
the
rocks
,
and
into
the
tops
of
the
ragged
rocks
,
for
.
the
fear
of
the
Lord
shall
come
upon
them
,
and
the
majesty
of
his
glory
shall
smite
them
when
he
ariseth
to
shake
terribly
the
earth
.
Cease
ye
from
man
,
whose
breath
is
in
his
nostrils
:
for
wherein
is
he
to
be
accounted
of
!
For
behold
,
the
Lord
,
the
Lord
of
hosts
,
doth
take
away
from
Jerusalem
and
from
Judah
the
stay
and
the
staff
,
the
whole
staff
of
bread
,
and
the
whole
stay
of
water
,
the
mighty
man
,
and
the
man
of
war
,
the
judge
,
and
the
prophet
,
and
the
prudent
,
and
the
ancient
,
the
captain
of
fitty
,
and
the
honorable
man
,
and
the
counsellor
,
and
the
cunning
artificer
,
and
the
eloquent
orator
,
And
I
will
give
children
.
unto
them
to
be
their
princes
,
and
babes
shall
rule
over
them
.
And
the
people
shall
be
oppressed
,
every
one
-
by
another
,
and
every
one
by
his
neighbor
:
the
child
shall
behave
himself
proudly
against
the
ancient
,
and
the
base
against
the
honorable
.
When
a
man
shall
take
hold
of
his
brother
of
the
house
of
his
father
,
and
shall
say
,
thou
hast
clothing
,
be
thou
our
ruler
,
and
let
not
this
ruin
come
under
thy
hand
:
in
that
day
shall
he
swear
,
saying
,
I
will
not
be
a
healer
;
for
in
my
house
there
is
neither
bread
nor
clothing
:.
make
me
not
a
ruler
of
the
people
.
For
Jerusalem
is
ruined
,
and
Judah
is
fallen
:
because
their
tongues
and
their
doings
have
been
against
the
Lord
,
to
provoke
the
eyes
of
his
glory
.
The
shew
of
their
countenance
doth
witness
against
them
,
and
doth
declare
their
sin
to
be
even
as
Sodom
,
and
they
cannot
hide
it
.
Wo
unto
their
souls
!
for
they
have
rewarded
evil
unto
themselves
..
Say
unto
the
righteous
,
that
it
is
well
with
them
:
for
they
shall
eat
the
fruit
of
their
doings
.
Wo
unto
the
wicked
!
for
they
shall
perish
:
for
the
reward
of
their
hands
shall
be
upon
them
,
e
awe
[File:093]
And
my
people
,
children
are
their
oppressors
,
and
women
rule
over
them
.
O
-
my
people
,
they
who
lead
thee
caust
thee
to
err
,
and
destroy
the
way
of
th
paths
.
The
Lord
standeth
up
to
plead
,
and
standet
to
judge
the
people
.
The
Lord
will
enter
into
judgment
with
the
ancients
of
his
people
,
and
the
princes
thereof
:
for
ye
have
eaten
up
the
vineyard
,
and
the
spoil
of
the
poor
in
your
houses
.
What
mean
ye
?.
Ye
beat
my
people
to
gicces
,
and
grind
the
faces
of
the
poor
,
saith
the
Lord
God
of
hosts
.
Moreover
the
Lord
saith
,
because
the
daughters
of
Zion
are
haughty
,
and
walk
with
stretched
forth
necks
and
wanton
eyes
,
walking
and
mincing
as
they
go
,
and
making
a
tinkling
with
their
feet
:
therefore
:
the
Lord
will
smite
with
a
scab
the
crown
of
the
head
of
the
daughters
of
Zion
,
and
the
Lord
will
discover
their
secret
parts
.
Inthat
day
the
Lord
will
take
away
the
bravery
of
their
tinkling
ornaments
,
and
cauls
,
and
round
tires
like
.
the
moon
,
the
chains
and
the
bracelets
,
and
the
mufflers
,
the
bonnets
,
and
the
ornaments
of
the
legs
,
and
the
head
-
bands
,
and
the
tablets
and
the
ear
-
rings
,
the
rings
,
and
nose
-
jewels
,
the
changable
suits
of
apparel
,
and
the
mantles
,
and
the
wimples
,
and
the
crisping
-
pins
,
the
glasses
,
and
the
fine
linen
,
and
hoods
,
and
the
vails
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
,
instead
of
sweet
smell
,
there
shall
be
stink
;:
and
instead
of
a
girdle
,
a
rent
;
and
instead
cf
well
set
hair
,
baldness
;
and
instead'
of
a
stomacher
,
a
girding
of
sackcloth
:
burning
instead
of
beauty
.
Thy
men
shall
fall
by
the
sword
,
and
thy
mighty
in
the
war
.
And
her
gates
shall
lament
and
mourn
;
and
she
shall
be
desolate
,
and
shall
sit
upon
the
ground
.
And
in
that
day
,
seven
women
shall
take
hold
of
one
man
,
saying
,
we
will
eat
ourown
bread
,
and
wear
our
own
apparel
:
only
let
us
be
called
by
thy
name
,
to
take
away
our
reproach
.
In
that
day
shall
the
branch
of
the
Lord
be
beautiful
and
glorious
;
the
fruit
of
the
poet
ctcalet
and
comely
to
them
that
are
escaped
of
srael
,
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
,
them
that
are
left
in
Zion
,
and
remain
in
Jerusalem
,
shall
be
called
holy
,
every
one
that
is
written
among
the
living
in
Jerusalem
:
when
the
Lord
shall
have
washed
away
the
filth
of
the
daughtersof
Zion
,
and
shall
have
purged
the
blood
of
Jerusalem
from
the
midst
thereof
by
the
spirit
of
judgment
,
and
by
the
spirit
of
burning
.
And
the
Lierd
[File:094]
will
create
upon
every
dwelling
-
place
of
mount
Zion
,
and
upon
her
assemblies
,
a
cloud
and
smoke
by
day
,
and
the
shining
of
a
flaming
fire
by
night
:
for
upon
all
the
:
glory
of
Zion
shall
be
adetence
.
And
there
shall
be
a
tabernacle
for
a
shadow
in
the
day
time
fron
:
the
heat
,
and
for
a
place
of
refuge
,
and
a
covert
from
storm
and
from
rain
.
And
then
wil
I
sing
to
my
well
beloved
a
song
of
my
beloved
touching
his
vineyard
.
My
well
beloved
hath
a
vineyard
in
a
very
fruitful
hill
:
and
he
fenced
it
,
and
gathered
out
the
stones
thereof
,
and
planted
it
with
the
choicest
vine
,
and
built
a
tower
in
the
midst
of
it
,
and
also
made
a
wine
-
press
therein
;
and
he
looked
that
it
should
bring
forth
grapes
,
and
it
brought
forth
wild
grapes
.
And
now
,
O
inhabitants
of
Jerusalem
,
and
men
of
Judah
,
judge
,
[
pray
you
,
betwixt
me
and
my
vineyard
.
What
could
have
been
done
more
to
my
vineyard
,
that
I
have
not
done
in
it]
.
Wherefore
,
when
I
looked
that
it
should
bring
forth
grapes
,
it
brought
forth
wild
grapes
.
And
now
go
to
;
will
tell
you
what
I
will
doto
my
vineyard
:
I
will
take
away
the
hedge
thereof
,
and
it
shall
be
eaten
up
;
and
I
will
break
down
the
wal
!
thereof
,
and
it
shall
be
trodden
down
:
and
I[
will
lay
it
waste
:
it
shall
not
be
pruned
nor
digged
;
but
there
shall
come
up
briers
and
thorns
:
I
will
also
command
the'clouds
that
they
rain
no
rain
upon
it
.
For
the
vineyard
of
the
Lord
of
hosts
is
the
house
of
Israel
,
and
the
men
of
Judah
his
<e
plant
:
and
he
looked
for
judgment
,
and
be
old
oppression
;
for
righteousness
,
but
behold
a
ery
.
Wo
unto
them
that
join
house
to
house
,
till
there
can
be
no
place
,
that
.
they
may
be
placed
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
earth
!
In
mine
ears
said
the
Lord
of
hosts
,
of
a
truth
many
houses
shall
be
desolate
,
and
great
.
and
fair
cities
without
inhabitant
.
Yea
,
ten
acres
of
vineyard
shall
yield
onebath
,
and
the
seed
of
a
homer
shall
yieldanephah
.
.
Wo
unto
them
that
rise
up
early
in
the
morning
,
that
they
may
follow
strong
drink
;
that
continue
until
night
,
and
wine
inflame
them
!
And
the
harp
,
and
the
viol
,
the
tabret
,
and
pipe
,
and
wine
are
in
their
feasts
;
but
they
regard
not
the
work
of
the
Lord
,
neither
consider
the
operation
of
his
hands
.
Therefoie
my
people
are
gone
into
captivity
,
because
they
have
no
knowledge
:
and
their
-
honorable
men
are
famished
,
and
their
multitude
dried
:
up
with
thirst
..
Therefore
hell
hath
enlarged
herself
,
and
,
opened
her
[File:095]
mouth
without
:
imeasure
:
:
and
:
their

,
and

their

and
{heir

;
and
:
he
that

shall
descend
into
it
.
And
the
mean
man
shall
be
brought
down
,
and
the
mighty
man
shall
be
humbled
,
and
the
eyes
of
the
lofty
shall

be
--
humbled
:
but
the
Lord
of
hosts
shall
be
exalted
in
judgment
,
and
God
that
is
holy
shall
be
sanctified
in
righteousness

Then
shall
the
lambs
feed
after
Aheir
manner
,
and
the
waste
places
of

Wo
unto

who

Therefore

the
chaff

their

shall
berottenness

because
they
have
cast
away
the
law
ofthe
Lord
of
hosts
,
and
despised
the
word
of
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
...
Therefore
,
is
the
anger
of
the
Lord
:
kindled
against
his
people
,
and
he
hath
stretched
forth
his

For

CHAPTER
IX
.
In
the
year
that
king
Uzziah
died
,
I
saw
also
.
the
Lord
sitting
upon
a
throne
,
-
high
and
lifted
up
,
and
his
train
filled
the
temple
.
Above
it
stood
the
seraphims
;
each
one
had
six
-
wings
;.
with
twain
he
coyered
his
face
,
and
with
twain
he
covered
his
feet
,
and
with
twain'
he
did
fly
,
And
one
cried
unto
another
,
and
said
,
Holy
,
holy
,
holy
,
is
the
Lord
ef
hosts
:
the
whole
earth
is
full
of
his
glory
.
.
And
the
posts
of
the
door
moved
at
.
the
voice
:
of
him
that
eried
,
and
.
the
house
was
filled
with
smoke
:
:
Then
.
said]
,
wo
isunto
mel
for
I
am
undone
;
heeause
I
am'a
-
nan
of
unelean
lips
,
and
I
dwell
im
the
midst
of
a
people
of
unclean
lips
:
for
mine
eyes
have
seen
the
King
,
the
Lord
of
:
hosts
.
Then
flew
one
of
the
seraphims
unto
me
,
having
a
live
coal
in
his
hand
,
which
he
had
taken
with
the
tongs
from
off
the
.
altar
:
and
he
laid
it
upon
-
my
mouth
,
and
said
,
Lo
,
this
has
touched
thy
lips
;
and
thine
iniquity
is
taken
away
,
and
thy
sin
purged
.
Also
-.
l
-
heard
the
voice
of
the
Lord
,
saying
,
whom
:
shall
I'send
,
and
who
will
go
for
us
?
~Then
I
said
,
here
am
I
;
send
me
.
And
he
said
;
go
,
and
:
tell
this
people
,
bear
.

.
indeed
,
but
they
understood
not
;
and
:

;
but
they

Make

the

shut

;,
lest
they

with
their
eyes
,
and
:

with
their
ears
,
and
understand
with
their
-
heart
;
and
be
converted
,
and
be
healed
.
hen
said
I
,
Lord
,
how
long
?
And
he
-
said
,
until
the
cities
be
wasted
.
without
inhabitant
,
andthe
houses
without
man
,
and
the
land
be
utterly
desolate
;
andthe
Lord
:

:
removed

far
away
,
for
:
there
shall
:
be
a
great'
forsaking
in
the
midst
of
the
lands
:
-
But
yet
there
-
shall
bea

,
and
they
shall
return
,
and
shall
be

when

the
holy
seed'shall
be
the
substance
:
thereof
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
Ahaz
the
son
of
Jotham
,
the
son
of
Uzziah
,
king
of
Judah
,
that
Rezin
,
[File:097]
king'of
Syria
,
and
Pekah
:
the
son
of'Remaliah
,
king
of
Israel
,
went
up
towards
Jerusalem
.
to
war
against
it
,
but
could
not
prevail
against/it
:
And
-
it
was
told
-
the
house
of
David
,
saying
,
Syriais
..
confederate
-
with
Ephraim
.
Andhis
heart
.
wasmoved
,
and
the
heart
of
hispeople
,
as
the
trees'of
the
.-
wood
:
are
moyed
with
the
wind
.
Then
said
the
Lord
-
unto
Isaiah
,
go
forth
now
to
meet
Ahaz
,
thou
,
and
Shearjashub
thy
son
,-
at
the
end
of
the
conduit
of
the
upper
-
pool
:
in
the
highway
of
the
fuller's
field
;
and
say
unto
him
,
take
heed
,
be
quiet
;
fear
not
,
neither
be
faint
-
hearted
for
the
dwo
tails
of
these
smoking
fire
-
brands
,
for
=the
fierce
anger
of
Rezin
with
Syria
,
arid
of
the
son
:
of
Remalia
.
Because
Syria
,
Ephraim
,
andthe
son
of
Remalia
,
have
taken
evil
counsel
against
thee
,
saying
,
let
us
go
up
against
Judah
,
and
vex
it
,
and
let
us
make
a
breach
therein
for
us
,
and
set
a
king
in
the
midst
of
it
,
yea
the
son
of
Tabeal
:
thus
saith
the
Lord
God
,
it
shal
!
not
stand
,
neither
shall
it
come
to
pass
.
For
the
head
of
Syria
is
Damascus
,
and
the
head
of
Damascus
,
Rezin
:
and
within
threescore
and
five
years
shall
Ephraim
be
broken
,
that
it
be
nota
people
.
And
the
.
head
of
Ephraim
.
is
Samaria
,
and
the
head
of
Samaria
is
Remalia's
son
.
If
ye
will
not
believe
,
surely
ye
shall
not
be
established
.
Â©
Moreover
,
the
Lord
spake
again
unto
Ahaz
,
saying
,
ask
thee
a
sign
of
the
Lord
thy
God
;
ask
it
either
in
the
depths
,
or
in
the
heights
above
.
But
-
Ahaz
said
-
I
will
not
ask
,
neither
will
I
tempt
the
Lord
.
And
he
said
;
hear
ye
now
,
O
house
of
David
;
'
is
ita
small
thing
for
you
to
weary
men
,
but
will
ye
weary
:
my
God
also
?
Therefore
the
Lord
himself
shall
give
you
a
sign
:
Behold
,
a
virgin
shall
conceive
,
and
shall
bear
a
son
,
and
shall
call
his

Inimanuel

Butter
and
honey
shall
he
eat
,
that
he
may
know
to
refuse
the
evil
,
and
te
choose
the
good
.
.
For
before
the
child
shall
know
to
refuse
the
evil
and
choose
the
good
,
the
land
that
thou
abhorrest
shall
be
fordaken
of

:
The
Lord
shall
bring

with

from

The
zeal
of
the
Lord'
of
hosts
will
perform
this
.
The
Lord
sent
his
word
unto
Jacob
and
it
hath
lighted
upon
Israel
.
And'all
the
people
shall
know
,
even
Ephraim
and
the
inhabitants
of
Samaria
,
that
say
in
the
pride
and
stoutness
of
heart
,
the
bricks
are
fallen
down
,
but
we
will
build
with
hewn
stones
:
the
sycamores
are
cut
down
,
but
we
will
change
them
into
cedars
.
Therefore
the
Lord
shall
set
up
the
adversaries
of
Rezin
against
him
,
and
join
his
enemies
together
;
the
Syrians
before
,
and
the
Philistines
behind
:
and
they
shall
devour
Israel
with
open
mouth
.
For
all
this
his
anger
is
not
turned
away
,
but
his
hand
is
stretched
out
still
.
For
the
people
turneth
not
unto
him
that
smiteth
them
,
neither
do
they
seek
the
Lord
of

..
Therefore
will
the
Lord
eut
off

Israel
head
and
tail
,

rush
in

day
.
The
ancient
,
he
is
the
head
;
and
the
prophet
that
teacheth
lies
,
he
is
the
tail

For
the
leaders
of
this
people
cause
them
.
to
err
;
and
they
that
are
led
of
them
are
destroyed
.
Therefore
the
Lord
shall
have
no
joy
in
their
young
men
,
neither
shall
have
mercy
on
their
fatherless
and
widows
:
for
every
one
of
them
isa
hypocrite
and
an
evildoer
,
and
every
mouth
speaketh
folly
.
For
all
this
:
his
anger
is
not

,
but
his
hand
stretched

For
wickedness
burneth

it

shall

they

Through

And

of

-
For
behold
,
'
Isaiah
,
spake
many
things

were

hard
:
for
many
of

pedple
to
understand
:
for'they
knew
not
concerning
the
mans
[File:108]
ner
of
prophesying
among
the
Jews
.
For
I
,
Nephi
,
have
not
taught
them
many
things
concerning
the
manner
of
the
Jews
;
for
their
works
were
works
:
of
darkness
,
and
their
doings
were
doings
of
abominations
.
Wherefore
,
I
write
unto
my
people
,
unto
all
those
that
shall
receive
hereafter
these
things
which
fT
write
,
that
they
may
know
the
judgments
of
God
,
that
they
come
upon
all

,

the

which
he
hath
spoken

Wherefore
hearken

0

my

,
which
are

of

,
and
give
ear
unto
my
words

words
of
Fsaiah
are
not
plain
unto
you
,
nevertheless
they
are
plain
unto
all
those
that
are
filled
with
the
spirit
of
prophecy
.
But
I
give
unto
you
a
prophecy
,
according
to
the
spirit
which
is
in
me
;
wherefore
I
shall
prophesy
according
to
the
plainness
which
hath
been
with
me
from
the
time
that
I
came
out
from
Jerusalem
with
my
father
:
for
behold
,
my
soul'
delighteth
in
plainness
unto
my
people
,
that
they
may
learn
;
yea
,
and
my
soul
delighteth
in
the
words
of
Isaiah
,
for
I
came
out
from
Jerusalem
,
and
mine
eyes
hath
beheld
the
things
of
the
Jews
,
and
I
know
that
the
Jews
do
understand
the
things
of
the
prophets
,
and
there
is
none
other
people
that
understand
the
things
which
were
spoken
unto
the
Jews
,
like
unto
them
,
save
it
be
that
they
are
taught
after
the
manner
of
the
things
of
the
Jews
.
But
behold
,
I
Nephi
,
have
not
taught
my
children
after
the
manner
of
the
Jews
;
but
behold
,
I
,
of
myself
,
have
dwelt
at
Jerusalem
,
wherefore
I
know
concern
ing
the
regions
round
about
;
and
I
have
made
mention
unto
my
children
concerning
the
judgments
of
God
,
which
hath
come
to
pass
among
the
Jews
,
unto
my
children
,
according
to
all
that
which
Isaiah
hath
spoken
,
and
I
:
do
not
write
them
.
Â©
But
behold
,
I
proceed
with
mine
own
prophecy
,
according
to
my
plainness
;
in
the
which
,
I
know
that
no
man
can
err
;
nevertheless
,
in
the
days
that
the
prophecies
of
Isaiah
shall
be
fulfilled
,
men
shall
know
of
a
surety
,
at
the
times
when
they
shall
eome
to
pass
;
wherefore
,
they
are
of
worth
unto
the
children
of
men
,
and
he
that
supposeth
that
they
are
not
,
unto
them
will
I
speak
particularly
,
and
confine
the'
words
unto'
mine
own
people
:
for
I
know
that
they
shall
be
of
great
warth
unto
them
in
the
last
days
;
for
in
that
day
shall
the
understand
them
;
.
wherefore
,
for
their
gaod
have
written
them
,
..
And
es
one
generation
hath
:
been
des
:
troyed
among
the
Jews
,
because
of
iniquity
,
even

[File:109]
have
they
been
destroyed
,
from

tion
,
according
to
their
iniqnities
;.
andnever
hath
any
of
them
been
destroyed
,
save
it
were
foretold
them
by
the
prophets
of
the
Lord
.
.
Wherefore
,
it
.
hath
been
told
them
concerning
the
destruction
which
should
come
upon
them
,
immediately
after
my
father
lefl
Jerusalem
;
nevertheless
,
they
hardened
them
hearts}
and
according
te
my
prophecy
,
they
have
been
:
destroyed
,
save
it
be
those
which
are
,
carried
away
cap
tive
into
Babylon
.
And
now
this
I
speak
because
of
the
spirit
which
is
in
me
.
And
notwithstanding
they
have
been
carried
away
,
they
shall
return
again
,
and
possess
the
land
of
Jerusalem

wherefore
they
shall
be
restored
again
to
the

land
of

iniquities

and
the
hardness

their
hearts

the

Behold
they
will
crucify
him

after
he
is
laid
in

that

Lord
willset
his

againthe
second
time
to

restore
his

from

state

Wherefore
,
he
-
will
proceed
to
doa
marvellous
work
,
and
a
wonder
among
the
children
of
men
.
Wherefore
,
he
shall
bring
forth
his
words
unto
them
;
which
words
shall
judge
them
at
the
last
day
,
for
they
shall
be
given
them
for
the
purpose
of
convincing
them
of
the
true
Messiah
,
who
was
rejected
by
them
;
and
unto
the
convincing
of
them
that
they
need
not
look
forward
any
more
for
a
Messiah
to
come
,
for
there
should
not
any
come
,
save
it
should
be
a
false
Messiah
,
which
should
deceive
the
people
:
for
there
is
save
one
Messiah
spoken
of
by
the
.
prophets
,
and
that
Messiah
is
he
who
should
be
rejected
of
the
Jews
.
For
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
,
the
Messiah
cometh
in
six
hundred
:
years
from
the
time
that
my
father
left
Jerusalem
;
and
according
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
,
and
also
the
word
of
the
angel
of
God
,
his
name
shall
be
Jesus
Christ
,
the
Son
of
God
.
And
now
my
:
brethren
,
I
have
spoken
plain
,
that
ye
cannot
err
;
and
as
the
Lord
God
liveth
,
that
brought
Israel
up
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
,
and'gave
unto
Moses
power
that
he
should
heal
the
nations
,
after
:
they
had
been
bitten
by
the
poisonous
serpents
,
if
they
would
cast
their
eyes
unto
the
serpent
which
he
did
raise
up
before
them
,
and
also
gave
him
power
that
he
should
smite
the
rock
,
and
the
water
should
come
forth
;
yea
,
behold
I
say
unto
you
,
thatas
these
things
are
true
,
and
as
the
Lord
God
liveth
,
there
is
none
other
name
given
under

,
save
it

for

that
it
is

by

are
saved

after

And
notwithstanding

we
keep

of
Moses

and
look
forward

<with
steadfastness
,
unto
Christ
,
until
the
law
shall

be
fulfilled
;
for
,
for
this
end
was
the

law
given
;
wherefore
,
the
law
-
hath
become
dead
unto
us
,
and
we
are
madealive
in
Christ
,
because
of
our
faith
:
yet
we
keep

the
law
because
of

and
we
talk
of
Christ

we
rejoice
in
Christ
,
we

we
prophesy
of

we

prophecies
,
that
our
children
may
know
to
what
source
they
may
look
for
a
remission
of
their

Wherefore
,
we
-
speak
concerning
the
law
,
that
our
children
may
know
the
deadness
of
the
law
;
and
they
,
by
knowing
the
deadness
of

may

that

whieh

And
after

And
.
now
behold
,
my
people
,
ye
are
a

people
;
wherefore
,
I
have
spoken
plain
unto
you
,
that
ye
cannot
misunderstand
.
And
the
words
which
Ihave
spoken
,
shall
stand
as
.
a
testimony
against
you
:
for
they
are
sufficient
to

teach
any
man
the
right
way
:
forthe
right
way
is
to
believe
in
Christ
and
deny
him
not

for
by
,
denying
him
,
ye
.
also
deny
the

the

And
now

I
say
unto
you

that
the
right

is
to
believe

and
they
perish
because
they

Wherefore

and
they
shall

and
all
manner

for

and
they

that

saith
the
Lord
of

.
O
the
pain
,
and
the
anguish
of
my
soul
for
the
loss
of
the
slain
of
my
people
!
For
I
,
Nephi
,
hath
seen
it
,
and
it
well
nigh
consuineth
me
before
the
presence
of
the
Lord
;
but
I
must
cry
unto
my
God
,
thy
ways
are
just
.
But
behold
,
the
righteous
,
that
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
prophets
,
and
destroy
them
not
,
but
look
forward
unto
Christ
with
steadfastness
for
the
signs
which
are
given
,
notwithstanding
all
persecutions
;
behold
they
are
they
which
shall
not
perish
.
But
the
Son
of
righteousness
shall
appear
unto
them
;
and
he
shall
heal
them
,
and
they
shall
have
peace
with
him
,
until
three
generations
shall
have
passed
away
,
and
many
of
the
fourth
generation
shall
have
passed
away
in
righteousness
.
And
-
when
these
things
have
passed
away
,
a
speedy
destruction
cometh
unto
my
people
;
for
,
notwithstanding
the
pains
of
my
soul
,
have
seen
it
;
wherefore
,
I
know
that
it
shall
come
to'pass
;
and
they
sell
-
themselves
for
nought
;
for
,
for
the
reward
of
their
pride
,
and
their
foolishness
,
they
shall
reap
destruction
;
for
because
they
.
yield
unto
the
devil
;
and
choose
works
of
darkness
rather
than
light
;
therefore
they
must
go
down
to
hell
,
for
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
will
not
always
strive
with
man
.
And
when
the
spirit
ceaseth
to
strive
with
man
,
then
.
cometh
speedy
destruction
;
and
this
grieveth
my
soul
.
so
tat
:
And
as
I
spake'
concerning
the
convincing
of
-
the
Jews
,
that
Jesus
is
the
very
Christ
,
it
must
needs
ba
,
[File:113]
that
the
Gentiles
be
convinced
also
,
that
Jesus
-
is
the
Christ
,
the
eternal
God
;
and
-
that
he
manifesteth
himself
unto
all
those
who
believe
in
him
,
by
the
power
ofthe
Holy
Ghost
;
yea
,
unto
every
nation

kindred

tongue

working
mighty
miracles

wonders
,
among
the
children

men

according
to

their
faith
.
But
behold
,
I
prophesy
unto
you
concerning
the
last
days
;
concerning
the
days
when
the
Lord
God
shall
bring
these
things
forth
unto
the
children
of
men

After
my
seed
and
the
seed
of
my
brethren
shall
have
dwindled
in

unbelief
,
and
shall
have
been
smitten
by
the
Gentiles
;
yea
,
after
the
Lord
God
shall
have
camped
against
them
,
round
about
,
and
shall
have
laid
seige
against
them
.
with
a
mount

raised
forts
against
them
;
and
after
they
shall
have
been
brought
down
low
in
the
dust
,
even
that
they
are
not
,
yet
the
words
of
the
righteous
shall
be
written
,
and
the
prayers
of
the
faithful
shall
be
heard
,
and
all
those
who
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
,
shall
not
be
forgotten
;
for
those
who
shall
be
destroyed
shall
speak
unto
them
out
of
the
ground
,
and
their
speech
shall
be
low
out

,
and
their

shall

be
as

one
that

a

spirit

for
the
Lord
God
will
give
unto
him
power
,
that
he
may
whisper

even
as
if
were
out

and

their
speech
shall
whisper
out

For
thus
saith
the
Lord
God
:
They
shall
write
the
things
which
shall
be
done
among
them
,
and
they
shall
be
written
and
sealed
up
in
a
book
,
and
those
who
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
,
shall
not
have
them
,.
for
they
seek
to
destroy
the
.
things
of
God
:
wherefore
,
as
those
who
have
been
destroyed
,
have
been
destroyed
speed
-
~
ily
;
and
the
multitude
of
their
terrible
ones
,
shall
-
be
as
chaff
that

Yea
,-
thus
saith
the
Lord
God
:
_
Jt
shall
be
at
an

And
it
shall
come
to

,
that
those
who
have
dwin
,
dled
in
unbelief
,
shall
be
smitten
by
the
hand
of
the
Gentiles
.
And
the
Gentiles
are
lifted
:
up
in
.
the
pride
of
their
eyes
,
and
have
stumbled
,
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
stumbling
block
,
'
that
they
have
built
up
many
churches
;
nevertheless
they
put
down
the
power
and
the
miracles
of
God
,.
and
preach
up
unto
themselves
,
their
own
wisdom
,
and
their

,
that
they
may
get

,
and
grind

Ses

For

my

I
say
:
unto
you
that
the
Lord
God
worketh
not
in
darkness

He
doeth
not
any
thing
;
save
it

for
he

even
that
he
layeth
down
his

,
that

he
may
draw
all
men

unto
him
.
Wherefore
,
he
commandeth
none
that
they
sail
not

of
his
salvation
.
Behold
,
doth
he
cry
unto
any
,
saying
,

Behold

[
say
unto

he

without

and
without

Behold
,
hath
he
commanded
any
that
they
should

out
of

synagogues
,

of

Behold

Hath
he

Behold
,

he

he
hath

that

all

Behold
,
the
Lord
hath
forbidden
this
thing
;
wherefore
,
the
Lord
Godhath
given
a
commandinent
,
that
all

charity
,
which
charity
is

-
And
except

wherefore

if

they

And

the

when

the

words

and
:
they

the
words

And
behold
the
beok
shall
be

:
and
in
the
book
shall
be
a
revelation
from
God
,.
from
the

beginning

of

world

to
the

thereof
...
Wherefore
...
because
of
the

things
which
are

the

are

shall
not
be'delivered

in
the
day
,
of
the
wickedness
and

abominations

of

the

people
..
Wherefore
the
.
book
:
shall

be
:
kept
from
;
them
...
But
the
book
shall
be
.
delivered
..
unto'a
man
,
and
he
.
shall
,
[File:116]
deliver
the
words
of
the
book
,
which
are
the
words
of
those
who
have
slumbered
in
.
the
dust
;.
and_
he
shall
deliver
these
words
unto
another
;
but
the
words
which
are
sealed
,
he
shall
not
deliver
,
neither
shall
he
deliver
the
book
.
For
the
book
shall
be
:
sealed
by
the
power
of
God
,
and
the
revelation
which
was
sealed
,
shall
be
kept
in
the
book
until
,
the
own
due
-
time
of
the
Lord
,
that
they
may
come
forth
:
for
,
behold
,
they
reveal
all
things
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
,
unto
the
end
thereof
.
And
the
day
cometh
that
the
words
of
the
book
which
were
sealed
,
shall
be
read
upon
the
house
-
tops
:
and
they
shall
be
read
by
the
power
of
Christ
:
:
and
all
things
shall
be
revealed
unto
the
children
of
men
which
ever
have
been
among
the
children
of
men
,
and
which
ever
will
be
,
even
unto
the
end
of
the
earth
.
Wherefore
,
at
that
day
when
the
,
book
shall
be
delivered
unto
the
man
of
whom
I
have
spoken
,
the
book
shall
be
hid
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
,
that
the
eyes
of
none
shall
behold
it
,
save
it
be
that
three
witnesses
shall
belicld
it
,
by
the
power
of
God
,
besides
him
to
whom
the
book
shall
be
delivered
;
and
they
shall
testify
to
the
truth
of
the
book
,
andthe
things
therein
.
'
And
there
is
none
other
which
shall
view
it
,
save
it
be
a
few
,
according
to
the
will
of
God
,
to
bear
testimony
of
his
-
word
unto
the
children
of
men
:
for
the
Lord
God
hath
said
,
that
the
words
:
of
the
faithful
should
speak
as
if
it
were
from
the
dead
.
Wherefore
,
the
Lord
God
will
proceed
to
bring
forth
the
words
of
the
book
;
and
in
the
mouth
of
as
many
witnesses
as
seemeth
him
good
,
will
he
establish
his
word
;
and
wo
be
unto
him
that
rejecteth
the
word
of
God
.
But
behold
,
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
Lord
God
shall
say
unto
him
to
whom
he
shall
deliver
the
book
,
take
these
words
.
which
are
not
.
sealed
,
and
deliver
them
to
another
,
that
he
may
-
shew
them
unto
the
learned
,
saying
:
read
this
,
I
pray
thee
.
And
the
learned
shall
say
,
bringhither
the
book
,
and'
I
will
read
them
:
and
now
,
because
of
the
glory
of
the
world
,
and
to
get
gain
,
will
they
say
this
,
and
not
for
the
glory
of
God
.
And
the
man
shall
say
,
I
cannot
bring
the
book
,
for
it
is
sealed
.
Then
shall
the
learned
say
,
I
cannot
read
it
..
Wherefore
it
shall
come
to
pass
,
that
the
Lord
God
will
deliver
again
the
book
and
the
words
thereof
,
to
him
that'is
not
learned
;
and
the
man
that
is
not
learned
;
shall
say
,
Iam
not
Jearned
.
Then
shall
the
Lord
God
say
unto
him
,
the
[File:117]
Jearned
shall
not
read
them
,.
for
they
have
rejected
them
,
and
Tam
able
to
do
mine
own
work
;
wherefore
,
thou
shalt
read
the
words
which'l
shall
give
unto
thee
.
Touch
not
the
things
which
are
sealed
,
for
I
will
bring
them
forth
in
mine
own
due
time
:
for
I
will
shew
unto
the
children
of
men
,
that
I
am
able
to
do
mine
own
work
.
Wherefore
,
when
thou
hast
read
the
words
which
[
have
commanded
thee
,
and
obtained
the
.
witnesses
which
.
I
have
promised
unto
thee
,
then
shalt
thou
seal
up
the
book
again
,
and
hide
it
up
unto
me
,
that
[
may
preserve
the
words
which
thou
hast
not
read
,
until
I
shall
see
fit
in
mine
own
wisdom
,
to
reveal
:
all
things
unto
thechildren
of
men
.
For
behold
,
lam
God
;
and
1
ain
a
God
of'
miracles
;
and
I
will
shew
unto
the
world
that
I
am
the
same
yesterday
,
to-day
,
and
forever
;
and
I
work
not
among
the
children
of
men
,
save
it
be
according
to
their
faith
.
And
again
it
shall
come
to
pass
,
that
the
Lord
shall
say
unto
him
that
shall
read
the
words
that
shall
be
delivered
him
,
forasmuch
as
this
people
draw
near
unto
me
with
their
mouth
,
and
with
their
lips
do
hon_
orme
,
but
have
removed
.
their
hearts
far
from
me
,
and
their
fear
towards
me
is
taught
by
the
precepts
of
men
,
therefore
,
I
will
proceed
to
:
do
a
marvellous
work
among
this
people
;
yea
,
a
marvellous
work
,
and
a
wonder
:
for
the
wisdom
of
their
wise
and
learned
shall
perish
,
and
the
understanding
of
their
prudent
shall
be
hid
.
And
wo
unto
.
them
that
seek
deep
to
hide
their
counsel
from
the
.
Lord
.
And
their
works
are
inythe
dark
;
and
they
say
,
who
seeth
us
;
and
who
knoweth
us
?
And
they
also
say
,
surely
,
your
turning
of
things
upside
down
,
shall
be
esteemed
as
the
potter's
clay
.
.
But
behold
,
I
will
shew
unto
them
,
saith
the
Lord
of
hosts
,
that
I
know
all
their
works
.
For
shall
the
work
say
of
him
that
made
it
,
he
made
me
not
?
Orshall
the
thing
:
framed
say
of
him
that
framed
it
,
he
had
no
understanding
?
But
behold
,
saith
the
Lord
of
hosts
,
I
will
shew
unto
the
children
of
men
,
that
it
is
not
yet
a
very
little
while
,
and
Lebanon
shall
be
turned
into
a
fruitful
field
;
and
the
fruitful
field
shall
be
esteemed
asa
forest
.
And
in
that
day
shall
the
deaf'
hear
the
words
of
the
book
;
.
and
the
eyes
of
the
blind
shall
see
out
of
obscurity
and
out
of
darkness
;
and
the
meek
also
shall
increase
,
:
and
their
Joy
shall
be
inthe
:
Lord
;
and
the
:
poor
among
men
shall
rejoice
in'the
Holy'One
of
Israel
.
For
assuredly
as
the
Lord
liveth
,
they
shall
see
that
the

is
brought
to

nought
,
and
the
scorner
is
consumed
,
and
all
that

for

cut

off
;
and
they
that

a

an

for

CHAPTER
XII
.
Anp
now
,
behold
,
my
brethren
,
I
have
spoken
unto
you
according
as
,
the
-
spirit
hath
constrained
me
;
wherefore
,
know
that
they
must
surely
come
to
pass
.
The
things
which
shall
be
written
out
of
the
book
shall
be
of
great
worth
unto
the
children
of
men
,
and
especially
unto
our
seed
,
which
is
a
remnant
of'
the
house
of
Israel
,
or
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
that
day
,
that
the
churches
which
are
built
up
,
and
not
unto
the
Lord
,
when
the
-
one
shall
say
unto
the
other
,
Behold
,
I
,
I
am
the
Lord's
;
and
the
other
shall
say
,
I
,
lam
the
Lord's
.
And
thus
:
shall
.
every
one
say
,
that
hath
built
up
churches
,
and
not
unto
the
Lord
;
and
they
shall
contend
one
with
another
;
and
their
priests
shall
contend
one
with
another
;
andthey
shali
teach
with
their
learning
,
and
deny
the
Holy
Ghost
,
which
giveth
utterance
.
And
they
deny
the
power
of
God
,
the
Holy
Qne
ef
Israel
;
and
they
say
unto
the
people
,
hearken
unto
us
,
and
hear
ye
our
precept
:
for
behold
,
there
is
no
God
to-day
,
for
the
Lord
and
the
Redeemer
hath
done
his
work
,
and
he
hath
given
his
power
unto
men
...
Behold
,
hearken
ye
unto
my
precept
:
if
they
shall
say
there
isa

by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
believe
it
not
;
for
this
day
he
is
not

God
of
miracles
;
he
hath
done

drink
,
and
be
merry
,-
for
to
-
morrow
we
die
:
and
it
shall
be
well
with
us
.
And
there
shall
also
be
many
which
shall
say
,
eat
,
drink
,
and
be
merry
;
nevertheless
,
fear
God
,
he
will
justify
in
committing
a
little
sin
;
yea
,
lie
a
little
,
take
the
advantage
of
one
because
of
his
words
,
dig
a
pit
for
thy
neighbor
;
there
is
no
harm
in
this
.
And
do
all
these
things
,
for
to
-
morrow
we
die
;
and
if
it
so
be
that
we
are
guilty
,
God
will
beat
us
witha
few
stripes
,
and
at
last
we
shall
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
God
.
Yea
,
and
there
shall
be
many
which
shall
teach
after
this
manner
,
false
,
and
vain
,
and
foolish
doctrines
,
and
shall
be
puffed
up
in
their
hearts
,
and
shall
seek
deep
to
hide
their
counsels
from
the
Lord
;
and
their
works
shall
be
in
the
dark
;
and
the
blood
of
the
saints
shall
cry
from
the
ground
against
them
.
Yea
,
they
have
all
gene
out
of
the
way
;
they
have
become
corrupted
.
Because
of
pride
,
and
because
of
false
teachers
,
and
false
doctrine
,
their
churches
have
become
corrupted
;
and
their
churches
are
lifted
up
;
because
of
pride
,
they
are
puffedup
.
They
rob
the
poor
,
because
of
their
fine
sanctuaries
;
they
rob
the
poor
,
because
of
their
fine
clothing
;
and
they
persecute
the
meek
,
and
the
poor
in
heart
;
because
in
their
pride
,
they
are
puffed
up
..
They
wear
stiff
necks
,
and
high
heads
;
yea
,
and
because
of
pride
,
and
wickedness
,
and
abominations
,
and
whoredoms
,
they
have
all
gone
astray
,
save
it
be
a
-
few
,
who
are
the
humble
followers
of
Christ
;
nevertheless
,
they
are
led
,
that
in
many
instances
they
do
err
,
because
they
are
taught
by
the
precepts
of
men
.
O
the
wise
,
and
the
learned
,
and
the
rich
,
that
are
puffed
up
in
the
pride
of
their
hearts
,
and
all
those
who
preach
false
doctrines
,
and
all
those
who
commit
whoredoms
,
and
pervert
the
right
way
of
the
Lord
;
wo
,
wo
,
wo
be
unto
them
,
saith
the
Lord
God
Als
mighty
,
for
they
shall
be
thrust
down
to
hell
.
Wo
unto
them
that
turn
aside
the
just
for
a
thin
of
nought
,
and
revile
against
that
which
is
good
,
an
say
that
is
of
no
worth
:
for
the
day
shall
come
that
the
Lord
.
God
will
speedily
visit
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
;
and
in
that
day
that
they
are
fully
ripe
in
iniquity
,
they
-
shall
perish
.
But
,
behold
,
if
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
shall
repent
of
their
wickedness
and
abominations
,
they
shall
not
be
destroyed
,
saith
the
Lord
of
:
hosts
;
But
behold
,
that
great
and
abominable
church
,
the
whore
of
all
the
earth
,
must
tumble
to
[File:120]
the
earth
;
and
great
must
be
the
fall
thereof
;
for
the
kingdom
of
the
devil
must
shake
,
and
they
which
belong
to
it
must
needs
be
stirred
up
unto
repentance
,
or
the
devil
will
grasp
them
with
his
everlasting
chains
,
and
they
be
stirred
up
to
anger
and
perish
;
for
behold
,
at
that
day
shall
he
rage
in
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
,
and
stir
them
up
to
anger
against
that
which
is
good
;
and
others
will
he
pacify
,
and
lull
them
away
into
carnal
security
,
that
they
will
say
,
all
is
well
in
Zion
;
yea
,
Zion
prospereth
,.
all
is
well
;
and
thus
the
devil
cheateth
their
souls
,
and
leadeth
them
away
carefully
down
.
to
hell
.
And
behold
,
others
he
flattereth
away
,
and
telleth
them
there
isno
hell
;
and
he
saith
unto
them
,
I
am
no
devil
,
for
there
isnone
:
and
thus
he
whispereth
in
their
ears
,
until
ho
grasps
them
with
his
awful
chains
,
from
whence
there
is
no
deliverance
.
Yea
,
they
are
grasped
with
death
and
hell
;
and
death
,
and
hell
,
and
the
devil
,
and
all
that
have
been
seized
therewith
,
must
stand
before
the
throne
of
God
,
and
be
judged
according
to
their
works
,
from
whence
they
must
go
into
the
place
prepared
for
them
,
even
a
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
,
which
is
endless
torment
.
Therefore
,
wo
be
unto
him
that
is
at
ease
in
Zion
.
W'o
be
unto
him
that
erieth
,
allis
well
;
yea
,
wo
be
unto
him
that
hearkeneth
unto
the
precepts
of
men
,
and
denieth
the
power
of
God
and
the
gift'of
the
Holy
Ghost
.
Yea
,
wo
be
unto
him
that
saith
,
we
have
received
,
and
-
we
need
no
more
.
And
in
fine
,
wo
unto
.
all
those
who
tremble
,
and
are
angry
because
of
the
truth
of
God
,
For
be
hold
,
he
that
is
built
upon
the
rock
,
receiveth
it
with
gladness
;
and
he
that
.
is
built
upon
a
sandy
foundation
,
trembleth
,
lest
he
shall
fall
.
Wo
be
unto
him
that
shall
say
,
we
have
received
the
word
of
God
,
and
we
need
no
more
of
the
word
of
God
,
for
we
have
enough
.
For
behold
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
God
:
I
will
give

the
children
of
men

ear
unto
my
counsel
,
for
they
shall
learn

[File:121]
Wo
be
unto
the
Gentiles
,
raith
the
Lord
God
of
host
;
for
notwithstanding
I
shail
lengthen
out
mine
arm
unto
them
from
day
to
day
,
they
will
deny
me
;
nevertheless
,
I
will
be
merciful
unto
them
,
saith
the
Lord
God
,
if
they
will
repent
and
come
unto
me
:
for
mine
arm
is
lengthened
out
all
the
day
long
,
saith
the
:
Lord
God
of
hosts
.
But
behold
,
there
shall
be
many
at
that
day
,
when
I
shall
proceed
to
do
a
marvellous
work
among
them
,
that
I
may
remember
my
covenants
which
I
have
made
unto
the
children
of
men
,
that
I
may
set
my
.
hand
again
the
second
time
to
recover
my
people
,
which
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
;
and
also
,
that
I
may
remember
the
promises
which
I
have
made
unto
thee
,
Nephi
,
and
also
unto
thy
father
,
that
would
remember
your
seed
;
and
that
the
words
of
your
seed
should
proceed
forth
out
of
my
mouth
unto
your
seed
.
And
my
words
shall
hiss
forth
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
,
for
a
standard
unto
my
people
,
which
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
.
And
because
my
words
shall
hiss
forth
,
many
of
the
Gentiles
shall
say
,
a
bible
,
a
bible
,
we
have
got
a
bible
,
and
there
cannot
be
any
more
bible
.
But
thas
saith
the
Lord
God
:
O
fools
,
they
shall
have
a
bible
;
and
it
shall
proceed
forth
from
the
Jews
,
imine
ancient
covenant
people
.
And
what
thank
they
the
Jews
for
the
bible
which
they
receive
from
them
?
Yea
,
what
do
the
Gentiles
mean
?
Do
they
remember
the
travels
,
and
the
labors
,
amd
the
pains
of
the
Jews
,
and
their
diligence
unto
me
,
in
bringing
forth
salvation
unto
the
Gentiles
?
O
ye
Gentiles
,
have
ye
remembered
the
Jews
,
mine
ancient
covenant
people
?
nay
;
but
ye
have
cursed
them
,
and
have
hated
them
,
and
have
not
sought
to
recover
them
.
But
behold
,
I
will
return
all
these
things
upon
your
own
heads
:
for
I
the
Lord
,
hath
not
forgotten
my
people
.
Thou
fool
,
that
shall
say
,
a
bible
,
we
have
got
a
bible
,
and
we
need
no
more
bible
,
Have
ye
obtained
a
bible
,
save
it
were
by
the
Jews
?
Know
ye
not
that
there
are
-
more
nations
than
one
?
Know
ye
not
that
I
the
Lord
your
God
,
have
created
all
men
,
and
that
I
remember
those
who
are
upon
the
isles
of
the
sea
;
and
that
I
rule
in
the
heavens
.
above
,
and
in
the
earth
beneath
;
and
I
bring
forth
my
word
unto
the
children
of
men
,
yea
,
even
upon
all
the
nalions
of
the
earth
?
Wherefore
murmur
ye
,
because
that
ye
shall
receive
more
of
my
word
?
Know
ye
not
that
the
testimony
of
two
nations
ig
a
witness
unto
[File:122]
you
that
am
God
,
that
I
remember
one
nation
like
unto
another
?)
Wherefore
,
I
speak
the
same
words
unto
one
nation
like
unto
another
.
And
when
the
two
nations
shall
run
together
,
the
testimony
of
the
two
nations
shail
run
together
also
...
And
I
do
this
that
I
may
prove
unto
many
,
that
-
I
am
the
same
yesterday
,
to-day
,
and
forever
;
and
that
I
speak
forth
my
words
according
to
mine
own
pleasure
.
And
because
that
I
have
spoken
one
word
,
ye
need
not
suppose
that
I
cannot
speak
another
;
for
my
work
is
not
yet
finished
;
neither
shall
it
be
,
until
the
end
of
man
;
neither
irom
that
time
henceforth
and
forever
.
Wherefore
,
because
that
ye
havea
bible
,
ye
need
not
suppose
that
it
contains
all
my
words
;
neither
need
ye
suppose
that
I
have
not
caused
more
to
be
written
:
for
[
command
all
men
,
both
in
the
east
,
and
in
the
west
,
and
in
the
north
,
and
in
the
south
,
and
in
the
islands
of
the
sea
,
that
they
shall
write
the
words
which
I
speak
unto
them
:
for
out
of
the
books
which
shal]
be
written
,
I
will
judge
the
world
,
every
man
according
to
their
works
,
according
to
that
which
is
written
.
For
behold
,
1
shall
speak
unto
the
Jews
,
and
they
shall
write
it
;
and
I
shall
also
speak
unto
the
Nephites
,
and
they
shall
write
it
;
And
I
shall
also
speak
unto
the
other
tribes
of
the
house
of
Israel
,
which
I
have
led
away
,
and
they
shall
write
it
;
andI
shall
also
speak
unto
all
nations
of
the
earth
,
and
they
shall
write
it
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
Jews
shall
have
the
words
of
the
Nephites
,
and
the
Nephites
shall
have
the
words
of
the
Jews
;
and
the
Nephites
and
the
Jews
shall
have
the
words
of
the
lost
tribes
of
Israel
;
and
the
lost
tribes
of
Israel
shall
have
the
words
of
the
Nephites
and
the
Jews
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
my
people
which
are
of
the
House
of
Israel
,
shall
be
gathered
home
unto
the
lands
of
their
possessions
;
and
my
word
also
shall
be
gathered
in
one
.
And
I
will
shew
unto
them
that
fight
against
my
word
and
against
my
people
,
who
are
of
the
house
of
Israel
,
that
lam
God
,
and
that
I
covenantedwith
Abraham
that
I
would
remember
his
seed
forever
.
And
now
,
behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
would
speak
unto
you
:
for
[
,
Nephi
,
would
not
suffer
that
ye
should
suppose
that
ye
are
more
righteous
than
the
Gentiles
shall
be
.
For
behold
,
except
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of
God
ye
shall
all
likewise
perish
;
and
because
of
the
words
which
have
been
[File:123]
spoken
ye
need
not
suppose
that
the
Gentiles
are
utterly
destroyed
.
For
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
as
many
of
the
Gentiles
as
will
repent
,
are
the
covenant
people
of
the
Lord
;
and
as
many
of
the
Jews
as
will
not
repent
,
shall
be
cast
off
:
for
the
Lord
covenanteth
with
none
,
save
it
be
with
them
that
repent
and
beheve
in
his
Son
,
who
is
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
.
And
now
,
I
would
prophesy
somewhat
more
concerning
the
Jews
and
the
Gentiles
.
For
after
the
book
of
which
I
have
spoken
shall
come
forth
,
and
be
written
unto
the
Gentiles
,
and
sealed
up
again
unto
the
Lord
,
there
shall
be
many
which
shall
believe
the
words
which
are
written
;
and
they
shall
.
carry
them
forth
unto
the
remmant
of
our
seed
.
And
then
shall
the
remnant
of
our
seed
know
concerning
us
,
how
that
we
came
out
from
Jerusalem
,
and
that
they
are
descendants
of
the
Jews
.
And
the
gospel
of
Jesus
Christ
shail
be
declared
among
them
;
wherefore
,
they
shall
be
restored
unto
the
knowledge
of
their
fathers
,
and
also
to
the
knowledge
of
Jesus
Christ
,
which
was
had
among
their
fathers
.
And
thenshall
they
rejoice
:
for
they
shall
know
that
it
isa
blessing
unto
them
from
the
hand
of
God
;
and
their
scales
of
darkness
shall
begin
to
fall
from
their
eyes
;
and
many
generations
shall
not
pass
away
among
them
,
save
they
shall
be
a
white
and
a
delightsome
people
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
Jews
which
are
scattered
,
also
shall
begin
to
believe
in
Christ
;
and
they
shall
begin
to
gather
in
upon
the
face
of
the
land
;
and
as
many
as
shall
believe
in
Christ
,
shall
also
become
a
delightsome
people
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
Lord
God
shall
commence
his
work
,
among
all
nations
,
kindreds
,
tongues
,
and
people
,
to
bring
about
the
restoration
ot
his
people
upon
-
the
earth
,
And
with
righteousness
shall
the
Lord
God
judge
the
poor
,
and
reprove
with
equity
,
for
the
meek
of
the
earth
.
And
he
shall
smite
the
earth
with
the
rod
of
his
mouth
;
and
with
the
breath
of
his
lips
shall
he
slay
the
wicked
:
for
the
time
speedily
cometh
,
that
the
Lord
God
shall
cause
a
great
division
among
the
people
;
and
the
wicked
will
he
destroy
;
and
he
will
spare
his
people
,
yea
,
even
if
it
so
be
that
he
must
destroy
the
wicked
by
fire
.
And
righteousness
shall
be
the
girdle
of
his
loins
,
and
faithfulness
the
girdle
of
his
reins
.
And
then
shall
the
wolf
dwell
with
the
lamb
,
and
the
leopard
shall
lie
down
with
the
kid
;
and
the
calf
,
and
the
young
lion
,
[File:124]
and
the
fatling
,
together
;
and
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
.
And
the
cow
and
the
bear
shall
feed
;
their
young
ones
shall
lie
down
together
;
and
the
lion
shall
eat
straw
like
the
ox
.
And
the
sucking
child
shall
play
on
the
hole
of
the
asp
,
and
the
weaned
child
shall
put
his
hand
on
the
cockatrice's
den
.
They
shall
not
hurt
nor
destroy
in
all
my
holy
mountain
;
for
the
earth
shall
be
full
of
the
knowledge
of
the
Lord
,
as
the
waters
cover
the
sea
.
'
Wherefore
,
the
things
of
all
nations
shall'be
made
known
;
yea
,
all
things
shall
be
made
known
unto
the
children
of
men
.
There
is
nothing
which
is
secret
,
save
it
shall
be
revealed
;
there
is
no
works
of
darkness
,
save
it
shall
be
made
manifest
in
the
light
;
and
there
is
nothing
which
is
sealed
upon
the
earth
,
save
it
shall
be
Joosed
..
Whierefore
,
all
things
which
have
been
revealed
unto
the
children
of
men
,
shall
at
that
day
be
revealed
;
and
satan
shall
have
power
over
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
no
more
,
for
a
long
time
.
And
now
my
beloved
brethren
,
must
make
an
end
of
my
sayings
.
CHAPTER
XIli
.
Axp
now
TI
,
Nephi
,
make
an
end
of
my
prophesying
unto
you
,
my
beloved
brethren
.
And
I
cannot
write
but
afew
things
,
which
J
know
must
surely
come
to
pass
;
neither
can
I
write
but
afew
of
the
words
of
my
brother
Jacob
.
Wherefore
the
things
which
I
have
written
,
sufficeth
me
,
save
it
,
be
a
few
words
which
I
must
speak
,
concerning
the
doctrine
of
Christ
;
wherefore
,
[
shall
speak
unto
you
plainly
,
according
to
the
plainness
of
my
prophesying
.
Fer
my
soul
delighteth
in
plainness
:
for
after
this
manner
doth
the
Lord
God
work
among
the
children
of
men
.
For
the
Lord
God
giveth
light
unto
the
understanding
:
for
he
speaketh
unto
men
according
to
their
language
,
unto
their
understanding
.
Wherefore
,
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
have
spoken
unto
you
,
concerning
that
proplret
which
the
Lord
showed
unto
me
,
that
should
baptize
the
Lamb
of
God
,
which
should
take
away
the
sins
of
the
world
.
And
now
,
if
the
Lamb
of
God
,
hebeing
holy
,
should
have
need
to
be
baptized
-
by
water
,
to
fulfil
all
right
[File:125]
eousness
,
O
then
,
how
.
much
more
need
have
we
,
being
unholy
,
to
be
baptizeu
,
yea
,
even
by
water
.
And
now
,
[
would
ask
of
you
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
wherein
the
Lamb
of
God
did
fulfil
all
righteousness
in
being
baptized
by
water
?
Know
ye
not
that
he
was
holy
?
But
notwithstanding
he
being
holy
,
he
showeth
unto
the
children
of
men
,
that
according
to
the
flesh
,
he
humbleth
himself
before
the
Father
,
and
witnesseth
unto
the
Father
that
he
would
be
obedient
unto
him
in
keeping
his
commandments
;
wherefore
,
after
he
was
baptized
with
water
,
the
Holy
Ghost
descended
upon
him
in
the
form
of
a
dove
.
And
again
:
It
sheweth
unto
the
children
of
men
.
the
straightness
of
the
path
,
and
the
narrowness
of
the
gate
,
by
which
they
should
enter
,
he
having
set
the
example
before
them
.
And
_
he
said
unto
the
children
of
men
,
follow
thou
me
.
Wherefore
,
my
.
beloved
brethren
,
can
we
follow
Jesus
,
save
we
shall
he
willing
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
Father
?)
And
the
Father
said
,
repent
ye
,
repent
ye
,
and
be
baptized
in
the
name
of
my
belovad
Son
.
And
also
,
the
voice
of
the
Son
came
unto
me
saying
,
he
that
is
baptized
in
my
name
,
to
him
will
the
Father
give
the
Holy
Ghost
,
like
unto
me
;
wherefore
,
follow
me
,
and
do
the
things
which
ye
have
seen
me
do
.
Wherefore
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
know
that
if
ye
shall
follow
the
Son
,
with
full
purpose
of
heart
,
acting
no
hypocrisy
aud
no
deception
before
God
,
but
with
real
intent
,
repenting
of
your
sins
,
witnessing
unto
the
Father
that
yeare
willing
to
take
Upon
you
the
name
of
Christ
,
by
baptism
:
yea
,
by
following
your
Lord
and
your
Savior
down
into
the
.
water
,
according
to
his
word
;
behold
,
then
shall
ye
receive
the
Holy
Ghost
;
yea
,
then
cometh
the
baptism
of
fire
and
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;
and
then
can
ye
speak
with
the
tongue
of
angels
,
and
shout
praises
unto
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
.
But
behold
,
my
.
beloved
brethren
,
thus
came
the
voice
of
the
Son
unto
me
,
saying
,
after
ye
have
repented
of
your
sins
,
and
witnessed
unto
the
Father
that
ye
are
willing
to
keep
my
commandments
,
by
the
baptism
of
water
,
and
have
received
the
baptism
of
fire
and
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
and
can
speak
with
a
new
tongue
,
yea
,
even
with
the
tongue
of
angels
,
and
after
this
,
should
deny
me
,
it
would
have
been
better
for
you
,
that
ye
had
not
known
me
.
And
I
heard
a
voice
from
the
Father
,
saying
,
yea
,
the
words
of
my
beloved
,
are
true
and
faithful
,
He
[File:126]
that
endureth
to
the
end
,
the
same
shall
be
sayed
..
And
now
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
know
,
by
this
,
that
unless
a
man
shall
endure
to
the
end
,
in
following
the
example
of
the
Son
of
the
living
God
,
he
cannot
be
saved
;
wherefore
,
do
the
things
which
I
have
told
you
I
have
seen
,
that
your
Lord
and
your
Redeemer
should
do
:
for
,
for
this
cause
have
they
been
shown
unto
me
,
that
ye
might
know
the
gate
by
which
ye
should
enter
.
For
the
gate
by
which
ye
should
enter
,
is
repentance
,
and
baptism
by
water
;
and
then
cometh
a
remission
of
your
sins
by
fire
,
and
by
the
Holy
Ghost
.
And
then
are
ye
in
this
straight
and
narrow
path
which
leads
to
eternal
life
;
yea
,
ye
have
entered
in
by
the
gate
:
ye
have
done
according
to
the
coup
mandments
of
the
Father
and
the
Son
;
and'
ye
have
received
the
Holy
Ghost
,
which
witnesses
of
the
Father
and
the
Son
,
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
promise
which
he
hath
made
,
that
if
ye
entered
in
by
the
way
;
ye
should
receive
.
And
now
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
after
ye
have
gob
ten
into
this
straight
and
narrow
path
,
I
Would
ask
,
if
all
is
done
?
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
;
for
ye
have
not
come
thus
far
,
save
it
were
by
the
word
of
Christ
,
with
unshaken
faith
in
him
,
relying
wholly
upon
the
merits
of
Him
who
is
mighty
to
save
;
wherefore
,
ye
must
press
forward
with
a
steadfastness
in
Christ
,
having
a
perfect
brightness
of
hope
,
and
a
love
of
Godand
of
allmen
.
Wherefore
,
if
ye
shall
press
for
ward
,
feasting
upon
the
word
of
Christ
,
and
endure
to
the
end
,
behold
,
thus
saith
the
Father
:
ye
shall
have
eternal
life
.
And
now
,
behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
this
is
the
way
;
and
there
is
none
other
way
nor
name
given
under
heaven
,
whereby
man
can
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
God
.
And
now
,
behold
,
this
is
the
doctrine
of
Christ
,
and
the
only
and
true
doctrine
-
of
the
Father
,
and
of
the
Son
,
and
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
which
is
one
God
,
without
end
.
Amen
.

CHAPTER
XIV
.
Axp
now
,
behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
suppose
that
ye
ponder
somewhat
in
your
hearts
,
concerning
[File:127]
that
which
ye
should
do
,
after
ye
shave
entered
in
by
the
way
.
But
behold
,
why
do
ye
ponder
these
things
in
your
heartst
Do
ye
not
remember
that
I
said
unto
you
,
that
after
ye
had
received
the
Holy
Ghost
,
ye
could
speak
with
the
tongue
of
angels
?
And
now
,
how
could
ye
speak
with
the
tongue
of
angels
,
save
it
were
by
the
Holy
Ghostt
Angels
speak
by
the
power
:
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;
wherefore
,
they
speak
the
words
of
Christ
.
Wherefore
,
I
said
unto
you
,
feast
upon
the
words
of
Christ
:
for
behold
,
the
words
of
Christ
will
tell
you
all
things
what
ye
should
de
..
Wherefore
,
now
after
1
have
spoken
these
words
,
if
ye
cannot
understand
them
,
it
will
be
because
ye
ask
not
neither
do
ye
knock
;
wherefore
,
ye
are
not
brought
into
the
light
,
but
must
perish
in
the
dark
.
For
behold
,
again
I
say
unto
you
,
that
if
ye
will
enter
in
by
the
way
,,
and
receive
the
Holy
Ghost
,
it
will
shew
unto
you
all
things
what
.
ye
should
do
.
Behold
,
this
is
the
doctrine
of
Christ
;
and
there
will
be
no
more
doctrine
given
,
until
after
he
shall
manifest
himself
unto
you
In
the
flesh
.
And
when
he
shall
manifest
himself
unto
you
in
the
flesh
,
the
things
which
he
shal]
say
unto
you
,
shall
ye
observe
to
do
.
And
now
I
,
Nephi
,
cannot
say
more
:
the
spirit
stoppeth
mine
utterance
,
and
I
am
left
to
mourn
because
of
the
unbelief
,
and
the
wickedness
,
and
the
ignorance
,
and
the
stifl
-
neckedness
of
men
:
for
they
will
not
search
knowledge
,
nor
understand
great
knowledge
,
when
it
is
given
unto
them
in
plainness
,
even
as
plain
as
word
can
be
.
And
now
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
pereeive
that
ye
ponder
stilt
in
your
hearts
;
and
it
grieveth
me
that
I
must
speak
concerning
this
thing
.
For
if
ye
would
hearken
unto
the
spirit
which
teacheth
a
man
to
pray
,
ye
would
know
that
ye
must
pray
:
for
the
evil
spirit
teacheth
not
a
man
to
pray
,
but
teacheth
him
that
he
must
not
pray
.
But
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
ye
must
pray
always
,
and
not
faint
;
that
ye
must
not
perform
any
thing
unto
the
Lord
,
save
in
the
first
place
ye
shall
pray
unto
the
Father
in
the
name
of
Christ
,
that
he
will
consecrate
thy
performance
unto
thee
,
that
thy
performance
may
be
for
the
welfare
of
thy
soul
.
[File:128]
CHAPTER
XV
.
Axp
now
I
,
Nephi
,
cannot
write
all
the
things
which
were
taught
among
my
people
;
neither
am
!
mighty
in
writing
,
like
unto
speaking
:
for
whens
man
speaketh
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
carrieth
it
unt
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
.
But
beheld
,
there
are
many
that
harden
their
hearts
against
the
Holy
Spirit
,
that
it
hath
no
place
in
them
;
Wherefore
,
they
cast
many
things
away
which
are
written
,
and
esteem
them
as
things
of
nought
.
But
J
,
Nephi
,
have
written
what
have
written
;
and
esteem
it
as
of
great
worth
,
and
especially
unto
my
people
.
ForI
pray
.
continually
for
them
by
day
,
and
mine
eyes
water
my
pillow
by
night
,
because
of
them
;
and
I
cty
unto
my
God
in
faith
,
and
I
know
that
he
will
hear
my
ery
;
and
I
know
that
the
Lord
God
will
conseerate
my
prayers
,
for
the
giin
of
my
people
.
And
the
,
words
which
I
.
have
written
in
weakness
,
will
be
made
strong
unto
them
;
for
it
persuadeth
them
to
do
good
;
it
maketh
known
unto
them
of
their
fathers
;
and
it
speaketh
of
Jesus
,
and
persuadeth
them
to
believe
in
him
,
and
to
endure
to
the
end
,
which
is
life
eternal
.
And
it
speaketh
harsh
against
sin
,
according
to
the
plainness
of
the
truth
;
wherefore
,
no
man
will
be
angry
at
the
words
which
I
have
written
,
save
he
shall
be
of
the
spirit
of
the
devil
.
I
glory
in
plainness
;
1
glory
in
truth
:
I
glory
in
my
Jesus
,
for
he
hath
redeemed
my
soul
from
hell
.
I
have
charity
for
my
people
,
and
great
faith
in
Christ
,
that
I
shall
meet
many
souls
spotless
at
his
judgment
seat
.
IJ
have
charity
for
the
Jew
:
I
say
Jew
,
because
T
mean
them
from
whence
I
came
.
1
also
have

THE
BOOK
OF
JACOB
,
THE
BROTHER
OF
NEPHI
.
CHAPTER
I
.
The
words
of
his
preaching
unto
his
brethren
.
He
conJoundeth
a
man
who
secketh
to
overthrow
the
doctrine
of
Christ
.
A
few
words
toncerning
the
history
of
the
people
of
Nephi
.
For
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
fifty
and
five
years
had
passed
away
,
from
the
time
that
Lehi
left
Jerusalem
;
wheretore
,
Nephi
gave
me
,
Jacob
,
a
commandment
concerning
the
small
plates
,
upon
which
these
things
are
engraven
.
And
he
gave
me
,
Jacob
,
a
commandment
that
I
should
write
upon
these
plates
,
a
few
of
the
things
which
I
considered
to
be
most
precious
:
that
I
should
not
touch
,
save
it
were
lightly
,
concerning
the
history
of
this
people
which
are
called
the
people
of
Nephi
...
For
he
said
that
the
history
of
his
people
should
be
engraven
upon
his
other
plates
,
and
that
should
preserve
these
plates
,
and
hand
them
down
[File:130]
unto
my
seed
,
from
generation
to
generation
.
And
if
there
were
.
preaching
which
was
sacred
,
or
revelation
which
was
great
,
or
prophesying
,
that
I
should
engraven
the
heads
of
them
upon
these
plates
,
and
touch
upon
them
as
much
as
it
were
possible
,
for
Christ's
sake
,
and
for
the
sake
of
our
people
:
-
for
because
of
faith
and
great
anxiety
,
it
truly
had
been
made
manifest
unto
us
concerning
our
people
,
what
things
should
happen
unto
them
.
And
we
also
had
many
revelations
,
and
the
spirit
of
much
prophecy
;
wherefore
,
we
knew
of
Christ
and
his
kingdom
,
which
should
comie
.
Wherefore
,
we
labored
diligently
among
our
people
,
that
we
might
persuade
them
to
come
unto
Christ
,
and
partake
of
the
goodness
of
God
,
that
they
might
enter
into
his
rest
,
lest
by
any
means
he
should
swear
in
his
wrath
they
should
not
enter
in
,
as
in
the
provocation
in
the
days
of
temptation
,
while
the
children
of
Israel
were
in
the
wilderness
.
Wherefore
,
we
would
to
God
that
we
could
persuade
all
men
not
to
rebel
against
God
,
to
provoke
him
to
anger
,
but
that
all
men
would
believe
in
Christ
,
and
view
his
death
,
and
suffer
his
cross
and
bear
the
shame
of
the
world
;
wherefore
,
I
,
Jacob
,
take
it
upon
me
to
fulfil
the
commandment
of
my
brother
Nephi
.
Now
Nephi
began
to
be
old
,
and
he
saw
that
he
must
soon
die
;
wherefore
,,
he
annointed
a
man
to
be
a
king
and
aruler
over
his
people
now
,
according
to
the
reigns
of
the
kings
.
The
people
having
loved
Nephi
exceedingly
,
he
having
been
a
great
protector
for
them
,
having
wielded
the
.
sword
of
Laban
in
their
defence
,
and
having
labored
in
all
his
days
for
their
welfare
;
wherefore
,
the
people
were
desirous
to
retain
in
remembranee
his
name
.
And
whoso
should
reign
in
his
stead
,
were
called
by
the
people
,
second
Nephi
,
third
Nephi
,
&c
.
according
to
the
reigns
of
the
kings
;
and
thus
they
were
Called
by
the
people
,
let
them
be
of
whatever
name
they
would
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
-
died
.
Now
the
people
which
were
net
Lamanites
,
were
Nephites
;
nevertheless
,
they
were
called
Nepliites
,
Jacobites
,
Josephites
,
Zoramites
,
Lamanites
,
Lemuelites
,
and
Ishmaelites
.
But
I
,
Jacob
,
shall
not
hereafier
distinguish
them
by
these
names
,
but
I
shall
call
them
Lamanites
that
seek
{to
.
destroy
.
the
people
of
Nephi
;:
and
:
those
who
are
friendly
to
Nephi
,
I
shall
call
Nephites
,
or
the
people
of
Nephi
,
according
to
the
reigns
of
the
kings
.
[File:131]
And
now
it
came
to
,
pass
that
the
people
of
Nephi
,
under
the
reign
of
the
second
king
,
began
to
grow
hard
in
their
hearts
,
and
indulge
themselves
somewhat
in
wicked
practices
,
such
as
like
unto
David
of
old
,
desiring
many
wives
and
concubines
,
and
also
Solomon
,
his
son
:
yea
,
and
they
also
began
to
search
much
gold
and
silver
,
and
began
to
be
lifted
up
somewhat
in
pride
;
wherefore
,
I
,
Jacob
,
gave
unto
them
these
words
as
JI
taught
them
in
the
temple
,
having
firstly
obtained
mine
errand
from
the
Lord
.
For]
,
Jacob
,
and
my
brother
Joseph
,
had
been
consecrated
priests
,
and
teachers
of
this
people
,
by
the
hand
of
Nephi
.
And
we
did
magnify
our
office
unto
the
Lord
,
taking
upon
us
the
responsibility
,
answering
the
sins
of
the
people
upon
our
own
heads
,
if
we
did
not
teach
them
the
word
of
God
with
all
diligence
;
wherefore
,
by
laboring
with
ourmights
,
their
blood
might
not
come
upon
our
garments
;
otherwise
,
their
blood
would
come
upon
our
garments
,
and
we
would
not
be
found
spotless
at
the
last
day
.
ae
CHAPTER
H
.
Tae
words
which
Jacob
,
the
brother
of
Nephi
,
spake
unto
the
people
of
Nephi
,
after
the
death
of
Nephi
:
.
Now
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
,
Jacob
,
according
to
the
responsibilily
which
lam
under
to
God
,
to
magnify
mine
office
with
soberness
,
and
that
I
might
rid
my
garments
of
your
sins
,
I
come
up
into
the
temple
this
ay
,
that
I
might
declare
unto
you
the
word
of
God
;
and
ye
yourselves
know
,
that
[
have
hitherto
been
diligent
in
the
office
of
my
calling
;
but
I
this
day
am
weighed
down
with
much
more
desire
and
anxiety
for
the
welfare
of
your
souls
,
than
I
have
hitherto
been
..
For
behold
,
as
yet
,
ye
have
been
obedient
unto
the
word
of
the
Lord
,
which
I
have
given
unto
you
.
But
behold
,
hearken
ye
unto
me
,
and
know
that
by
the
help
of
the
all
-
powerful
Creator
of
heaven
and
earth
,
Tean'tell
you
concerning
your
thoughts
,
how
that
ye
are
beginning
to
labor
-
in
sin
,
which
sin
appeareth
very
abominable
unto
me
,
yea
,
and
abominable
unto
od
.
Yea
,
it
grieveth
my
soul
and
caugeth
me
to
shrink
with
shame
before
the
presence
of
my
Maker
,
that
[File:132]
I
might
testify
unto
you
concerning
the
wickedness
of
your
hearts
;
and
also
,
it
grieveth
me
that
I
must
use
so
much
boldness
of
speech
,
concerning
you
,
before
your
wives
and
.
your
children
,
many
of
whose
feelings
are
exceeding
tender
,
and
chaste
,
and
delicate
before
God
,
which
thing
is
pleasing
unto
God
;
and
it
supposeth
me
that
they
have
come
up
hither
to
hear
the
pleasing
word
of
God
,
yea
,
the
word
which
healeth
the
wounded
soul
.
Wherefore
,
it
burdeneth
my
soul
,
that
.
I
should
be
constrained
because
of
the
striet
commandment
which
I
have
received
from
God
,
to
admonish
you
,
according
to
your
crimes
,
to
enlarge
the
wounds
of
.
those
which
are
already
wounded
,
instead
of
consoling
and
healing
their
wounds
;
and
those
which
have
not
been
wounded
,
instead
of
feasting
upon
the
pleasing
word
of
God
,
have
daggers
placed
to
pierce
their
souls
,
and
wound
their
delicate
minds
.
But
,
notwithstanding
the
greatness
of
the
task
,
I
must
do
according
to
the
strict
commands
of
God
,
and
tell
you
concerning
your
wickedness
and
abominations
,
in
the
presence
of
the
pure
in
heart
,
and
the
broken
heart
,
and
under
the
glance
of
the
piercing
eye
of
the
Almighty
-
God
.
Wherefore
,
I
must
tell
you
the
truth
,
according
to
the
-
plainness
of
the
word
of
God
.
For
behold
,
as
I
enquired
of
the
Lord
,
thus
:
camie
the
word
unto
me
,
saying
,
Jacob
,
get
thou
up
into
the
temple
on
the
morrow
,
and
declare
the
word
whieh
I
shall
give
thee
unto
this
people
.
And
now
behold
,
my
brethren
,
this
is
the
word
which
I
declare
unto
you
,
that
many
of
you
have
begun
to
search
for
gold
,
and
for
silver
,
and
all
manner
of
precious
ores
,
in
the
which
this
land
,
which
isa
land
of
promise
unto
you
,
and
to
your
seed
,
doth
abound
most
plentifully
.
And
the
hand
of
providence
hath
smiled
upon
you
most
pleasingly
,
that
you
have
obtained
many
riches
;
and
because
some
of
you
have
obtained
more
abundantly
than
that
of
your
brethren
;
ye
are
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
your
hearts
,
and
wear
stiff
necks
,
and
high
heads
,
because
of
the
costliness
of
your
aj
parel
,
and
persecute
your
brethren
,
becanse
ye
suppose
that
ye
are
better
than
they
.
_jind
now
my
brethren
,
do
ye
suppose
that
God
juslifieth
you
in
this
thing
?
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
.
Buthe
condemneth
you
,,
and
if
ye
persist
in
these
things
,
his
judgments
must
speedily
come
unto'
you
.
O
that
he
would
shew
you
that
he
can
pierce
[File:133]
you
,
and
with
one
glance
of
his
eye
,
he
can
smite
you
to
the
dust
.
O
that
he
would
rid
you
from
this
iniquity
,
and
abomination
,
And
,
O
that
ye
would
listen
unto
the
word
of
hig
commands
,
and
Jet
not
this
pride
of
your
hearts
destroy
your
souls
.
Think
of
your
brethren
,
like
unto
yourselves
,
and
be
familiar
with
all
,
and
free
with
your
substance
,
that
they
may
be
rich
like
unto
you
.
But
before
ye
seek
for
riches
,
seek
ye
for
the
kingdom
of
God
.
And
after
ye
have
obtained
a
hope
in
Christ
,
ye
shall
obtain
riches
,
if
ye
seek
them
;
and
ye
will
seek
them
,
for
the
intent
to
do
good
;
to
clothe
the
naked
,
and
to
feed
the
hungry
,
and
to
liberate
the
captive
,
and
administer
relief
to
the
sick
,
and
the
.
afflicted
.
And
now
my
brethren
,
I
have
spoken
unto
you
concerning
pride
;
and
those
of
you
which
have
afflicted
your
neighbor
,
and
perseented
him
,
because
ye
were
proud
in
your
hearts
,
of
the
things
which
God
hath
given
you
,
what
say
ye
of
it
?
Do
ye
not
suppose
that
such
things
are
abominable
unto
him
,
who
created
all
flesh
?
And
the
one
being
is
as
precious
in
his
sight
asthe
other
.
And
all
flesh
is
of
the
dust
;
and
for
the
self
same
end
hath
he
crealdd
them
,
that
they
should
keep
his
commandments
,
and
glorify
him
forever
..
And
now
I
make
an
end
of
speaking
unto
you
concerning
this
pride
.
And
were
it
not
that
I
must
speak
unto
you
concerning
a
grosser
crime
,
my
heart
would
rejaice
exceedingly
,
because
of
you
.
But
the
word
of
God
burthens
me
because
of
your
grosser
crimes
.
For
behold
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
,
this
people
begin
to
wax
in
iniquity
;
they
understand
not
the
scriptures
:
for
they
seek
to
excuse
themselves
in
committing
whoredoms
,
beeause
of
the
things
which'
were
written
concerning
David
,
and
Sclomon
his
son
.
Behold
,
David
and
Solomon
truly
had
many
wives
and
concubines
,
which
thing
was
abominable
before
me
,
saith
the
Lord
.
wherefore
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
,
I
have
led
this
people
forth
out
of
the
lard
of
Jerusalem
,
by
the
power
of
mine
arm
,
that
I
might
raise
up
unto
me
a
righteous
branch
from
the
fruit
of
the
loins
of
Joseph
.
Wherefore
,
I
,
the
.
Lord
God
,
will
not
suffer
that
this
people
shall
do
like
unto
them
of
old
.
Wherefore
,
my
brethren
,
hear
me
,
and
hearken
to
the
word
of
the
Lord
:
for
there
shall
not
any
man
among
you
have
save
it
be
one
wife
;
and
concubines
he
shall
have
none
:
.
For
I
,
the
Lord
God
,
delighteth
in
the
chastity
of
women
.
And
whoredoms
are
an
abomination
before
me
:
thus
[File:134]
saith
the
Lord
of
hosts
.
.
Wherefore
,
this
people
shall
keep
my
commandments
,
saith
the
Lord
of
hosts
,
or
cursed
be
the
land
for
their
sakes
.
For
if
I
will
,
saith
the
.
Lord
of
hosts
,
raise
up
seed
unto
me
,
I
will
com
.
mand
my
people
:
otherwise
,
they
shall
hearken
unto
these
things
.
For
behold
,
I
,
the
Lord
,
have
seen
the
sorrow
,
and
heard
the
mourning
of
the
daughters
of
my
people
in
the
land
of
Jerusalem
;
yea
,
and
in
all
the
lands
of
my
people
,
because
of
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
their
husbands
.
And
I
will
not
suffer
,
saith
the
Lord
of
hosts
,
that
the
cries
of
the
fair
daughters
of
this
people
,
which
I
have
led
out
of
the
Jand
of
Jerusalem
,
shall
come
up
unto
me
,
against
the
men
of
my
people
,
saith
the
Lord
of
hosts
;
tor
they
shall
not
lead
away
captive
,
the
daughters
of
my
people
,
because
of
their
tenderness
,
save
I
shall
visit
them
with
a
sore
curse
,
even
unto
destruction
:
for
they
shall
not
commit
.
whoredoms
,
like
unto
them
of
old
,
saith
the
Lord
of
hosts
.
And
now
behold
,
my
brethren
,
ye
know
that
these
commandments
were
given
to
our
father
Lehi
;
wherefore
,
ye
have
known
them
before
;
and
ye
have
come
unto
great
condemnation
;
for
ye
have
.
doneÂ®
these
things
,
which
ye
ought
not
to
have
done
.
Behold
,
ye
have
done
greater
iniquities
than
the
Lamanites
,
our
brethren
.
Ye
have
broken
the
hearts
of
your
tender
wives
,
and
lost
the
confidence
of
your
children
,
because
of
your
bad
examples
before
them
;
and
the
sobbings
of
their
hearts
ascend
up
to
God
against
you
.
And
because
of
the
strictness
of
the
word
of
God
,
which
cometh
down
against
you
,
many
hearts
died
,
pierced
with
deep
wounds
.
But
behold
,
I
,
Jacob
,
would
speak
unto
you
that
are
pure
in
heart
.
Look
unio
God
with
firmness
of
mind
,
and
pray
unto
him
with
exceeding
faith
,
and
he
will
console
you
in
your
afflictions
,
and
he
will
plead
your
cause
,
and
send
down
justice
upon
those
who
seek
your
destruction
.
O
all
ye
that
are
pure
in
heart
,
lift
up
your
heads
and
receive
the
pleasing
word
of
God
,
and
feast
upon
his
love
;
for
ye
may
,
if
your
minds
are
firm
,
forever
.
But
wo
,
wo
,
unto
you
that
are
not
pure
in
lieart
;
that
are
filthy
this
day
before
God
;
for
except
ye
repent
;
the
land
is
cursed
for
your
sakes
;
and
the
Lamanites
,
which
are
not
-
filthy
like
unto
you
,
(
nevertheless
,
they
are
cursed
with
a
sore
cursing
)
shall
scourge
you
even
unto
destruction
.
And
the
time
speedily
cometh
,
[File:135]
that
except
ye
repent
,
they
shall
poxsess
the
land
of
your
inheritance
,
and
the
Lord'
God
will
lead
away
the
righteous
out
from
arnong
you
.
Behold
,
the
Lamanites
your
brethren
,
whom
ye
hate
,
because
of
their
fillhiness
and
the
cursings
which
hath
come
upon
their
skins
,
are
more
righteous'
than
you
;
for
they
have
not
forgotten
the
commandment
of
the
Lord
,
which
was
given
unto
our
fathers
,
that
they
should
have
,
save
if
were
one
wife
;
and
concubines
they
should
have
none
;
and
there
should
net
be
whoredoms
committed
among
them
.
And
now
this
commandment
they
observe
to
keep
;
wherefore
,
because
of
this
observance
in
keeping
this
commandment
,
the
Lord
God
wiil
not
destroy
them
,
but
will
be
merciful
unto
them
;
and
one
day
they
sha}l
become
a
blessed
people
.
Behold
,
their
husbands
love
their
wives
,
and
their
wives
love
their
husbands
,
'
and
their
husbands
and
their
wives
love
their
children
;
and
their
unbelief
and
their
hatred
towards
you
,
is
because
of
the
iniquity
of
their
fathers
;
wherefore
,
-
how
much
better
are
you
than
they
,
in
the
sight
of
your
great
Creator
?
O
my
brethren
,
I
fear
,
that
-
unless
ye
shall
repent
of
your
sins
,
that
their
skins
will
be
whiter
than
yours
,
when
ye
shall
be
brought
with
them
before
the
throne
of
God
.
Whetefore
,
a
commandment
I
give
unto
you
,
which
is
the
word
of
God
,
that
ye
revile
no
more
against
them
,
because
of
the
darkness
of
their
skins
;
neither
shall
ye
revile
against
them
because
of
their
filthiness
;
but
ye
shall
remember
your
own
filthiness
,
and
remember
that
their
filthiness
.
came
because
of
their
fathers
.
Wherefore
,
ye
shall
remember
your
children
,
how
that
ye
have
grieved
their
hearts
because
of
the
example
that
ye
have
set
before
them
;
and
also
,
remember
that
ye
may
,
because
of
your
filthiness
,
bring
your
children
unto
destruction
,
and
their
sins
be
heaped
upon
your
heads
at
the
last
day
.
O
my
brethren
,
hearken
.
unto
my
word
;
arouse
the
faculties
ef
your
soul
;
shake
yourselves
,
that
ye
may
awake
from
the
slumber
of
death
;
and
loose
yourselves
from
the
pains
of
hell
,
that
ye
may
not
become
angels
to
the
devil
,
to
be
cast
into
that
lake
offire
and
brim
:
stone
,
which
is

CHAPTER
Il
.
Now
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
,
that
I
,
Jacob
,
having
ministered
much
unto
my
people
,
in
word
,
(
and
[
eannot
write
but
a
little
of
my
words
,
because
of
the
dif
ficulty
of
engraving
our
words
upon
plates
,)
and
we
know
that
the
things
which
we
write
upon
plates
,
must
remain
;
but
whatsoever
things
we
write
upon
any
thing
save
it
be
upon
plates
,
must
perish
and
vanish
away
;
bat
we
can
write
a
few
words
upon
plates
,
which
will
give
our
children
,
and
also
our
beloved
brethren
,
a
small
degree
of
knowledge
concerning
us
,
or
concerning
their
fathers
,
Now
in
this
thing
we
co
rejoice
;
and
we
labor
diligently
to
ngraven
these
words
upon
plates
,
hoping
that
our
beloved
brethren
,
and
our
children
,
will
receive
then
yvith
thanktul
hearts
,
und
look
upon
them
,
that
they
may
learn
with
joy
,
and
not
with
sorrow
,
neither
with
contempt
concerning
their
first
parents
:
for
,
for
this
intent
have
we
written
these
:
things
,
that
they
may
know
that
we
knew
of
Christ
,
and
we
had
a
hope
of
his
glory
,
many
hundred
years
before
his
coming
,
and
not
only
we
,
ourselves
,
had
a
hope
of
his
glory
,
but
also
all
the
-
holy
prophets
which
were
before
us
.
Behold
,
they
believed
in
Christ
,
and
worshiped
the
Father
in
his
name
;
and
also
,
we
.
worship
the
Father
in
his
name
.
And
for
this
intent
,
we
keep
the
law
of
Moses
,
it
pointing
our
souls
to
him
;
and
for
this
cause
,
itis
sanctified
unto
us
,
for
righteousness
,
even
agit
was
accounted
unto
Abraham
in
the
wilderness
,
to
be
obedient
unto
the
commands
of
God
,
in
offering
up
his
son
Isaac
,
which
is
a
similitude
of
God
and
his
only
begotten
Son
.
Wherefore
,
wesearch'
the
prophets
;
and
we
have
many
revelations
,
and
the
spirit
of
prophecy
;
and
having
all
these
witnesses
,
we
obtain
a
hope
,
[File:137]
and
our
faith
becometh
unshaken
,
insomuch
that
we
truly
can
command
in
the
name
of
Jesus
,
and
the
very
trees
.
obey
us
,
or
the
mountains
,
or
the
waves
of
the
sea
;
nevertheless
,
the
Lord
God
sheweth
us
our
weakness
,
that
we
may
know
that
.
itis
by
his
grace
,
and
his
great
condescensions
unto
the
children
of
men
,
that
we
have
power
to
do
these
things
.
Behold
,
great
and
marvelous
are
,
the
works
of
the
Lord
.
J{ow
unsearchable
are
the
depths
of
the
mysteries
of
bim
;,
and
it
is
impossible
that
man
should
find
out
all
his
ways
.
And
no
man
knoweth
of
his
ways
,
save
it
be
revealed
unto
him
;
wherefore
,
breth
-
.
ren
,
despise
.
not
the
revelatidns
of
God
.
For
-
behold
,
by
the
power
of
his
word
,
man
came
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
;
which
earth
.
was
created
by
the
power
of
his
word
.
Wherefore
,
if
God
,
being
able
to
speak
,
and
the
world
was
;
and
to
speak
,
and
man
was
ereated
,
O
then
,
why
not
able
to
command
the
earth
,
or
the
workmanship
of
his
hands
upon
the
faee
of
it
,
according
to
his
will
and
pleasure
.
Wherefore
,
brethren
,
seek
not
to
counse]
the
Lord
,
but
to
take
counsel
from
his
hand
,
For
behold
,
ye
yourselves
know
,
that
he
counseleth
in
wisdom
,
and
in
justice
,
and
in
great
mercy
,
over
all
his
works
;
wherefore
,
beloved
brethren
,
be
reconciled
unto
him
,
through
the
atonement
of
Christ
,
his
enly
begotten
Son
,.
and
ye
may
..
obtain
a
resurrection
,
according
tothe
power
of
the
resurrection
which
is
in
Christ
,
and
be
presented
as
,
the
first
fruits
of
Christ
,
unto
God
,
haying
faith
,
and
obtained
a
good
hope
of
glory
in
him
,
before
he
manifesteth
himself
in
the
flesh
,
And
now
,
beloved
;
marvel
not
that
I
tell
you
these
things
;
for
why
not
speak
of
the
atonement
of
Christ
,
and
attain
to
a
perfect
knowledge
of
him
,
as
to
attain
to
the
knowledge
of
a
resurrection
and
the
world
to
come
?
Behold
,
my
brethren
,
he
that
prophesieth
,
let
him
prophesy
to
the
understanding
of
men
;
for
.
the
spirit
speaketh
the
truth
,
and
lieth
not
.
Wherefore
,
it
speaketh
of
things
as
they
really
are
,
and
of
things
as
they
really
will
be
;
wherefore
,
these
things
are
manifested
unto
us
plainly
,.
for
the
salvation
of
our
souls
,
But
behold
;
we
are
,
not
witnesses
alone
in
thee
slings
;
for
God
alse
spake
them
unto
prophets
of
old
.
;
:
But
behold
,
the
Jews
were
a
stiffnecked~
people
;
and
they
despised
the
words
of
plainness
,
and
killed
the
prophets
,
and
sought
for
things
.
that
they
could
[File:138]
not
understand
.
Wherefore
,
because
of
their
blindness
,
which
,
blindness
came
by
looking
beyond
the
mark
,
they
.
must
needs
fall
:
for
God
hath
taken
away
his
plainness
from
them
,
and
delivered
unto
them
many
-
things
which
they
cannot
understand
;
because
they
desired
it
.
And
because
they
desired
it
,
God
hath
done
it
,
that
they
may
stumble
.
And
now
I
,
Jacob
,
amled
on
by
the
spirit
unto
prophesying
:
for
I
perceive
by
the
workings
of
the
spirit
which
is
in
me
,
that
by
the
stumbling
of
the
Jews
,
they
:
will
reject
the
stone
upon
which
they
might
build
,
and
have
safe
foundation
..
But
behold
,
according
te
the
scriptures
,
this
stone
shall
become
the
great
,
and
the
last
,
and
the
only
sure
foundation
,
upon
which
the
Jews
can
build
.
And
now
,
my
beloyed
,
how
is
it
possible
that
these
,
after
having
rejected
the
sure
foundation
,
can
ever
build
upon
it
,
that
it
may
become
the
head
of
their
corner
?
Behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
will
unfold
this
mystery
,
unto
you
;
if
I
do
not
,
by
any
means
,
get
shaken
from
my
firmness
in
the
spirit
,
and
stumble
because
of
my
over
anxlety
for
you
.
Behold
,
my
brethren
,
do
ye
not
remember
to
have
read
the
words
of
the
prophet
Zenos
,
which
spake
unto
the
house
of
Israel
,
saying
;
hearken
O
ye
house
of
Israel
,
and
hear
the
words
of
me
,
prophet
of
the
Lord
:
for
behold
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
,
[
.
will
liken
thee
O
-
house
of
Israel
,
like
unto
a
tame
olive
tree
,
which
-
a
man
took
and
nourished
in
his
vineyard
:
and
it
grew
,
and
waxed
old
,
and
began
ta
decay
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
master
of
the
vineyard
went
forth
,
and
he
saw
that
his
olive
tree
began
to
decay
:
and
.
he
said
,
I
will
prune
it
,
and
dig
-
about
it
,
and
nourish
it
,
that
perhaps
it
may
shoot
forth
young
and
tender
branches
,
and
it
perish
not
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
pruned
it
,
and
digged
about
it
,
and
nourished
it
,
according
to
his'word
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
many
days
,
it
began
to
put
forth
somewhat
a
little
,
young
and
tender
branches
;
but
behold
,
the
main
top
thereof
began
to
perish
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
master
of
the
vineyard
saw
it
,
and
he
said
unto
his
servant
,
it
grieveth
me
that
I
should
lose
this
tree
;
wherefore
,
go
and
pluck
the
branches
from
a
wild
olive
tree
,
and
bring
them
hither
unto
ma
;
and
we
will
pluck
off
those
main
branches
which
.
are
beginning
to
wither
away
,
and'
we
will
cast'
them
into
the
fire
,
that
they
may
be
burned
.:
And
behold
,
saith
[File:139]
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
,
I
take
away
many
of
these
young
and
tender
branches
;
and
[
will
graft
them
whithersoever
will
;
and
it
mattereth
not
that
if
it
so
be
,
that
the
root
of
this
tree
will
perish
,
I
may
preserve
the
fruit
thereof
unto
myself
;
wherefore
,
[
-
will
take
these
young
and
tender
branches
,
and
I
will
graft
them
whithersoever
I
will
.
Take
thou
the
branches
of
the
wild
olive
tree
,
and
graft
them
in
,
in
the
stead
thereof
;
and
these
which
have
plucked
off
,
I
will
cast
into
the
fire
,
and
burn
them
,
that
they
.
may
not
cumber
the
ground
of
my
vineyard
.
x
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
servant
of
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
,
did
according
to
the
word
of
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
,
and
grafted
in
the
branches
of
the
wild
olive
tree
.
And
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
caused
that
it
should
be
digged
about
,
and
pruned
,
and
nourished
,
saying
unto
his
servant
,
it
grieveth
me
that
I
should
lose
this
tree
;
wherefore
,
that
perhaps
I
might
.
preserve
the
roots
thereof
that
they
perish
not
,
that
I
might
preserve
them
unto
myself
,
have
done
this
thing
.
Wherefore
,
go
thy
way
;
watch
the
tree
,
and
nourish
it
,
according
to
my
words
.
And
these
will
I
place
in
the
nethermost
part
of
my
vineyard
,
whithersoever
[
will
,
it
mattereth
not
unto
thee
;
and

do
it
,
that
[
may
preserve
unto
myself
the

me
that

And
it
came
to

that
the
Lord

some
in

,

that

said
unto

;

now

if

have

now

I

thereof
I
shall
Jay

And
it

came
to

that
the
Lord
of

said
unto

And
it
came
to'pass
that
the
servant
said
unto
his
master
,
how
comest
thou
hither
to
plant
this

tree
,
or
this
branch
of
the
tree
?
for
behold
,
it
was
the
poorest
spot
in

vineyard

And
the
Lord
of

vineyard
said
unto
him
,
counsel
me
not

I

that
it

the
tree
:
I
have
nourished
it
this
long

-
it
hath
brought
forth
much
fruit
;
therefore
,
gather
it
;

And
it
eame
to
pass
that
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
said
again
unto
his
servant
,
look
hither
,
and
behold
another
branch
also
,
which
I
have
planted
:
behold
that
I
have
nourished
it
also
,
and
it
hath
brought
forth
fruit
.
And
he
said
unto
the
servant
,
look
hither
,
and
behold
the
last
:
behold
,
this
have

I
planted
in
a
good
spot

of
ground
;:
and

I
:
have
nourished
it
this

long
time
;

only
a

part

hath
brought
forth

tame
fruit

the
other
part

tree
hath
brought
forth
wild
fruit
:
behold
,
I
have
nourished
this
tree
like

unto
the
others

And
it
came
to

that
the
Lord
of

said
unto
the

pluck
off
the
branches
that
have
not

good
fruit

cast
them
into

fire

But
behold
,
the
servant
said
unto
,
him
,
let
us
prune
it
,
and
dig
about
it
,
and
nourish
it
a
little
longer
,
that
perhaps
it
may
bring
forth
good
fruit
,
unto
thee
,
that
thou
canst
lay
it
up
against
the
season

And
it
came
to
.
pass
that
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
,
and
the
servant
of
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
,
did
nourish
all
the
fruit
of
the
vineyard

.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
a
long
time
had
passed
away
,
and
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
his
servant
,
come
,
let
us
go
down
into
the
vineyard
,
that
we
may
labor
again
in
the
vineyard
.
For
behold
,
the
time
draweth
near
,
and
the
end
.
soon
cometh
:
wherefore
,
I
must
lay
up
fruit
,
against
the
season
,
unto
mine
own
seli
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
of
the
yineyard
,
and
the
servant
,
went
dawn
into
the
vineyard
;
and
they
came
to
the
tree
whose
natural
branches
had
been
broken
off
,
and
the
wild
branches
had
been
grafted
in
;
and
behold
,
all
sorts
of
fruit
did
cumber
the
tree
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
did
taste
gf
the
fruit
,
every
sort
according
to
its
number
.
And
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
said
,
behold
,
this
long
time
have
we
nourished
this
tree
,
and
I
have
Jaid
up
unto
myself
against
the
season
,
much
fruit
.
But
behold
,
this
time
it
hath
brought
forth
much
fruit
,
and
there
is
none
.
of
it
whichis
good
.
And
behold
,
there
are
all
kinds
of
bad
fruit
;
and
it
profiteth
me
nothing
,
notwithstanding
all
our
labor
:
and
now
,
it
gaisyet
me
that
I
should
lose
this
tree

And
the
ord
of

unto

the

what
shall
ave
do
unto
the
tree
,
that
J

good
fruit
thereof
unto
mine
own

And
the
servant
said
unto
his
master
,

behgld
,
because
thou
didst
graft
in
the
branches
of
the
wild
olive
lree
,

.
it
caine
to

that
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
said
-
unto
his
servant
,
the
tree
profiteth
me
nothing
;
Â©
andthe
roots
thereof
profiteth
me
nothing
,
so
long
as
.
'
it
shall
bring
forth
evil
fruit
.
Nevertheless
,
1
know
[File:142]
that
the
:
roots
are
good
;
and
for
mine'
own
purpose
I
have
preserved
them
;
and
because
of
their
much
strength
,
they
have
hitherto
brought
.
forth
from
the
wild
branches
,
good
frnit
.
But
behold
,
the
wild
branches
have
grown
,
and
have
overran
the
roots
thereof
;
and
because
that
the
wild
branches
have
overcome
the
roots
thereof
,
it
hath
brought
forth
much
evil
fruit
;
and
because
that
it
hath
brought
forth
so
much
evil
fruit
,
thou
beholdest
that
it
beginneth
to
perish
:
and
it
will
soon
become
ripened
,
that
it
may
be
east
into
the
fire
,
except'
we
should
do
something
for
it
to
preserve
it
.
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
his
servant
,
let
us
go
down
inte'
the
nethermost
parts
of
the
vineyard
,
and
behold
if
the
natural
branches
have
also
brought
forth
evil
fruit
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
down
into
the
nethermost
parts
of
the
vineyard
.
And
it
caine
to
pass
that
they
beheld
that
the
fruit
of
the
natural
branches
had
become
corrupt
also
;
yea
,
the
first
,
and
the
second
,
and
also
the
last
;
and
they
had
all
become
corrupt
.
And
the
wild
fruit
of
the
last
,
had
overcome
that
part
of
the
tree
which
brought
forth
good
fruit
,
even
that
the
branch
had
withered
away
and
died
.
And
it
came
to
pass
thatthe
Lord
of
the
vineyard
wept
,
and
said
unto
the
servant
,
what
could
I
have
done
more
for
my
vineyard
?
Behold
,
[
knew
that
all
the
fruit
of
the
vineyard
,
save
it
were
these
,
had
become
corrupted
.
And
now
,
these
which
have
once
brought
forth
good
fruit
,
have
also
--
become
corrupted
.
And
now
,
all
the
trees
of
my
vineyard
are
good
for
nothing
,
save
it
be
to
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
.
And
behold
,
this
last
,
whose
branch
hath
withered
away
,
did
plant
in
a
good
spet
of
ground
;
yea
;
even
that
which
was
choice
unto
me
,
above
all
other
parts
of
the
land
of
my
vineyard
.
And
thou
beheldest
that
I
also
cut
down
that
which
cumbered
this
spot
of
ground
,
that
1
might
.
plant
this
tree
in
the
stead
thereof
.
And
thou
-
beheldest
that
a
part
thereof
,
brought
,
forth
good
fruit
:
and
a
part
.
thereof
,
brought
forth
wild
fruit
.:
And
because
I
plucked
not
the
branches
thereof
,
and
cast
them
into
the
fire
,
behold
,
they
have
overcome
the
good
branch
,
that
it
has
.
withered
away
.
And
now
behold
,
notwithstanding
all
the
care
which
we
have
taken
of
my
vineyard
;
the
trees
thereof
-
have
become
corrupted
,
that
they
:
bring
forth
no
good
fruit
:
and
these
I
had
hoped
to
[File:143]
preserve
,
to'have
laid
up
fruit
thereof
,
against
:
the
season
,
unto
mine
-
own
self
:.
But
behold
,
they
have
become
jike
untothe
wild
olive
tree
;
and
they
are
of
no
worth
,
but
to
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
:
and
it
grieveth
meethat
J
should
-
lose
them
.
But
what
could
1
have
.
done
more
in
my
vineyard
?
Have
I
slackened
mine
hand
,
that
I
have
not
nourished
it
?
Nay
;
I
have
nourished
it
,
and
I
have
digged
about
it
,
and
I
have
pruned
it
,
and
[
have
dunged
it
;
and
I
have
stretched
forth
mine
hand
almest
all
the
day
long
;
and
the
end
draweth
nigh
:
And
it
grieveth
me
that
[
should
hew
down
all
the
trees
of
my
vineyard
,
and
cast
them
into
the
fire
,
that
they
should
be
burned
.
Who
is
it
that
has
-
corrupted
my
vineyard
?
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
servant
,
said
unto
his
master
,
is
it
not
the
lottiness
of
thy
vineyard
?
Has
not
the
branches
thereof
overcome
the
roots
,
which
are
good
?
And'
because
the
branches
have
overcome
the
roots
thereof
,
behold
,
they
grew
faster
than
the
strength
of
the
roots
taking
strength
unto
themselves
.
Behoid
,
[
say
,
is
not
this
the
cause
that
the
trees
of
thy
vineyard
have
become
corrupted
?
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
the
servant
,
let
us
go
to
;
and
hew
down
the
trees
of
the
vineyard
,
and
cast
them
into
the
fire
,
that
they
shall
not
-
cumber
the
ground
of
my
vineyard
;
for
T
have
done
all
;
what
could
I
have
done
more
for
my
vineyard
?
But
behold
,
the
servant
said
unto
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
,
spare
it
a
little
longer
.
And
the
Lord
:
said
,
yea
,
I
will
spare
ita
little
longer
:
for
it
grieveth
me
that
I
should
lose
the
trees
of
my
vineyard
.
Wherefore
let
us
take
of
the
branches
of
these
which
[
have
planted
in
the
nethermost
parts
of
my
vineyard
,
and
let
us
graft
them
into
the
tree
from
whence
they
came
;
and
let
us
pluck
.
from
the
tree
those
branches
whose
fruit
is
most
bitter
,
and
graft
in
the
natural
branches
of
the
tree
in
the
stead
thereof
.
And
this
will
Ido
,
that
the
tree
may
not
perish
,
that
perhaps
[
may
preserve
unto
myself
the
roots
thereof
,
for
mine
own
-
purpose
.
And
behold
,
the
roots
of
the
natural
branches
of
the
tree
which
planted
whithersoever
I
would
,
are
yet
alive
;
wherefore
,
that
I
may
preserve
them
also
;:
for
mine
own
purpose
,
[
will
take
of
the
branches'
of
this
tree
,
and
1
will
graft
them
:
in
unto
them
,
Yea
,
I
will
graft
in
unto
them'
the
branches
of
their
mothertree
;
that
I
may
preserve
:
the
[File:144]
roots
also
.
unto
mine
own
self
,
that
when
they
shall
be
sufficiently
strong
,
perhaps
they
may
bring
forth
good
fruit
unto
me
,
and
I
may
yet
have
glory
.
in
the
fruit
of
my
.
vineyard
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
from
the
natural
tree
which
had
become
wild
,
and
grafted
in
unto
the
natural
trees
,
which
also
had
become
wild
;
and
they
also
took
of
the
natural
trees
which
had
become
wild
,
and
grafted
inte
their
mother
tree
.
And
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
the
servant
,
pluck
not
the
wild
branches
from
the
trees
,
save
it
be
those
which
are
most
.
bitter
;
and
in
them
ye'shall
graft
,
according
to
that
.
which
1
have
said
.
And
we
will
nourish
again
the
trees
of
the
vineyard
,
and
we
will
trim
up
the
branches
thereof
;
and
we
will
pluck
from
the
trees
those
branches
which
are
ripened
,
that
must
perish
,
and
cast
them
into
the
fire
.
And
this
I
do
,
that
perhaps
the
roots
thereof
may
take
strength
,
because
of
their
goodness
;
and
because
of
the
change
of
the
branches
,
that
the
good
may
overcome
the
evil
;
and
beoause
that
J
have
preserved
the
natural
branches
,
and
the
roots
thereof
;
and
that
I
have
grafted
in
the
natural
branches
again
,
into
their
mother
tree
;
and
have
preserved
the
roots
of
their
mother
tree
,
that
perhaps
the
trees
of
my
vineyard
may
bring
forth
again
good
fruit
;
and
that
I
may
have
joy
again
in
the

and
perhaps
that
I
may
rejoice
exceedingly
,
that
I
have
preserved
the
roots
and
the
branches
of
the
first
fruit
.
Wherefore
,
go
to
,
and
call
servants
,
that
we
may
labor
diligently
with
our
mights
in
the
vineyard
,
that
we
may
prepare

,
that
I
may
bring
forth
again
the
natural
fruit
,
which
natural
fruit
is
good
,
and
the
most
precious
above
all
otier
fruit
.
Wherefore
,
let
us
go
to
,
and
labor
with
our
mights
,
this
last
time
:
for
behold
the
end
draweth

and
this

to

thereof

all
at

;
est
the

thereof
should
be
too
strong
for
the

,
and
the
graft
thereof
shall
perish
,
and
lose
the

of

.
For
it
grieveth
me
that
I
should
lose
the
trees
of
my
vineyard
;.
wherefore
,
ye
shall
clear
away
the
bad
,
according
as
the
good
shall
grow
,
that
the
root
and
the
top
may
be
equal
in
strength
,
until
the
good
shall
overcome
the
bad
,
and
the
bad
be
hewn
down
and
east
into
the
fire
,
that
they
cumber
not
the
ground
of
my
vineyard
;
and
thus
will
I
sweep
away
the
bad
out
of
my
vineyard
.
And
the
branches
of
the
natural
tree
,
will
I
graft
in
again
,
into
the
natural
tree
;
and
the
branches
of
the
natural
tree
,
will
{
graft
into
the
natural
branches
of
the
tree
;
and
thus
will
I
bring
them
together
again
,
that
they
shall
bring
forth
the
natural
fruit
:
and
they
:
shall
be
one
.
And
the
.
bad
shall
be
cast
away
;
yea
,
even
out
of
all
the
land
of
my
vineyard
:
for
behold
,
only
this
once
will
1
prune
my
vineyard
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
sent
his
servant
;
and
the
servant
went
.
and
did
as
the
Lord
had
commanded
him
,
and
brought
other
servyants
;
and
they
were
few
.
And
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
said
unto
them
,
go
to
,
and
labor
in
the
vineyard
,
with
your
mights
.
For
behold
,
this
is
the
last
time
that
I
shall
nourish
my
vineyard
:
for
the
end
is
nigh
at
hand
,
and
the
season
speedily
cometh
;
and
if
ye
fabor
with
your
mights
with
me
,
ye
shall
have
joy
in
the
fruit
which
I
shall
lay
up
unto
myself
,
against
the
time
which
will
soon
come
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
servants
did
go
,
and
labor
with
their
mights
;
and
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
labored
also
with
them
:
and
they
did
obey
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
,
in
all
things
.
And
there
began
to
be
the
natural
fruit
again
in
the
vineyard
;
and
the
natural
branches
began
to
grow
and
thrive
exceedingly
;
and
the
wild
branches
:
began
to
be
plucked
off
,
and
to
:
be
cast
away
;
and
.
they
did
keep
the
-
reot
and
the
top
:
thereof
,
equal
,
according
to
the
strength
thereof
.
'
And
.
thus
they
labored
,
with
all
diligence
;
according
to
the
-
commandments
.;
of
the
Lord
of
:
the
vineyard
,
even
:
until
the
bad
.
had
.
been
east
away
-
out
of
the
vineyard
,
and
the
Lord
:
had
preserved
unto
himself
;
that
the
trees
.
had
)
become
again
the
natural

fruit
;
and
they
became
like
untoione
body
;
[File:146]
and
the
fruit
were
equal
;
and
the
Lord
.
of
the
vineyard
had
preserved
unto
himself
the
natural

fruit
,
which
was
most
precious
unto
him
irom
:
the
beginning
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lord
of
the
vineyard
saw
that
his
fruit
was
good
,
and
that
his
vineyard
was
no
:
more
corrupt
;
he
called
up
his
servants
and
said
unto
them
,
behold
,
for
this
last
time
have
we
nourished
my
vineyard
;.
and
thou
beholdest
that
I
have
done
according

my
will
;

have
preserved

,
that
itis
good

even
like
as

in

For
because
ye
have
been
diligent
-
in
laboring
with
me
in
my
vineyard
,
and
have
kept
my
commandments
,
and
have
brought
unto
me
again
the
natural
fruit
,
that
my
vineyard
is
no
more
corrupted

and
the
bad
is
cast
away
,
behuld
,
ye
shall
have
joy
with
me
,
because
of
the
fiuit
of
my
vineyard
.
For
behold
,
for
a
long
time
will
I
lay
up
of
the
fruit
of
my
vineyard
unto
mine
own
self
,
against
the
season
,
which
speedily
cometh
;
and
for
the
last
time
have
I
nourished
my
vineyard
,
and
pruned
it
,
and
dug
about
it
,
and

that

And
when

into

will
I
cause

my

as

that

thisis
my
prophesy
:
That
the
things
which
this
prophet
Zenos
.
spake
,
concerning
the
house
of
Israel
,
in
the
which
he
likened
them
unto
a
tame
olive
tree
;
must
surely
come
.
to
pass
.
And
in
the
day
that
he
shall
set

people
,
is
the
day
,
yea
,
even
the
last
time
,
that
the
servants
-
of
the
Lord
shall
go
forth
in
his
power
,
to
nourish
.
and
:
prune
.
-
his

vine
[File:147]

;
and
after
that
,
the
end
soon
cometh
.
And
how
Sieased
are
they
who
have
labored
diligently
ia
his
vineyard
;
and
how
cursed
are
they
who
shall
be
cast
out
into
their
ewn
place
!
And
the
world
shall
be
burned
with
fire
.
And
tow
merciful
is
our
God
unto
us
:
for
he
remembereth
the
house
of
Israel
,
both
roots
and
branches
;.
and
.
he
stretches
forth
his
hands
unto
them
,
all
the
day
long
:
and
they
are
a
stiffneckedy
and
a
gainsaying
people
:
but
as
many
as
will
not
harden
their
.
hearts
,
shall
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
God
.
Wherefore
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
1
beseech
of
you
in
werds
of
soberness
,
that
ye
would
repent
,
and
come'
with
full
purpose
of
heart
,
and
cleave
unto
God
as

unto
you

And
while
his

is
extended
towards
you
in
the
light
of

,
harden'not
your

.
.
Yea
,
to-day
if
ye
will
hear
his
voice
,
harden
not
your
hearts
:
for
why
will
yedie
?
For
behold
,
alter
ye
have
been
nourished
by
the
good
.
word
of
God
all
the
day
long
,
will
ye
bring
forth
evil
fruit
,
that
ye
must
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
?
Behold
,
will
ye
reject
these
words
?
Will
ye
:
reject
the
words
.
of
the
prophets
?
and
will
ye
reject
all
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
concerning
Christ
,
after
.
so
many
have
spoken
concerning'
him
?
and
deny
the
good
word
of
Christ
,
and
the
power
of
God
,
and
the
gift
of
the
.
Holy
Ghost
,
and
quench
the
Holy
Spirit
?
and
make
a
mock
of
the
great
plan
of
redemption
,
which
bath
been
laid
for
you
?
Know
ye
not
that
if
ye
will
do
these
things
,
that
.
the
power
of
the
redemption
and
.
the
resurrection
which
is
in
Christ
,
will
bring
you
.
to
stand
with
shame
and
awful
guilt
before
the
bar
of
God
?
And
according
to
the
power
of
justice
,
for
justice
cannot
be
denied
,
ye
must
go
away
into
that
lake
of
fire

brimstone
,
whose
flames
are
unquenchable
,
and
whose
smoke
ascendeth
up
forever
and
ever
,
which
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
,
is
endless
torment
..
O
then
,
my
beloved
:
brethren
,
repent
ye
,
and
enter
in
at
the
straight
gate
,
and
continue
in

O
be

:
what
can

more
?
Finally
,
1
bid
you
farewell
,
until
I
shall
meet
you
before

CHAPTER
V
,
:
Anp
now
it
came
to
pass
after
some
years
had
passed
away
,
there
came
a
man
among
the
people
of
Nephi
,
whose
name
was
Sherem
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
began
to
preach
among
the
people
,
and
to
declare
unto
them
that
there'should
be
no
Christ
.
And
he
preached
many
things
which
were
flattering
unto
the
people
;
and
this
he
did
that
he
might
overthrow
the
doctrine
of
Christ
.
And
he
labored
diligently
that
he
might
lead
away
the
hearts
of
the
people
,
insomuch
that
he
did
lead
away
-
many
hearts
;
and
he
knowing
that
J
,
Jacob
,
had
faith
in
Christ
who
should
come
,
he
sought
much
opportunity
that
he
might
come
unto
me
.
And
he
was
learned
,
that
he
hada
perfect
knowledge
of
the
language
of
the
people
;
wherefore
,
he
could
use
much
flattery
,
and
much
power
of
speech
,
according
to
the
power
of
the
devil
.
And
he
had
hope
to
shake
me
from
the
faith
,
notwithstanding
the
many
revelations
,
and
the
many
things
which
Ihad
seen
concerning
these
things
:
for
I
truly
had
seen
angels
,
and
they
had
ministered
unto
me
,
And
also
,
I
had
heard
the
voice
of
the
Lord
spreaking
unto
me
in
very
word
,
from
time
to
time
;
wherefore
,
could
not
be
shaken
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
came
unto
me
;
and
on
this
wise
did
he
speak
unto
me
,
saying
:
Brother
Jacob
,
I
have
sought
much
opportunity
that
I
might
speak
unto
you
:
for
I
have
heard
and
also
know
,
that
thou
geest
about
much
,
preaching
that
which
ye
call
the
gospel
,
or
the
doctrine
of
Christ
;
and
ye
have
led
away
much
of
this
people
,
that
they
pervert
the
right
way
of
God
,
and
keep
not
the
law
of
Moses
,
which
is
the
right
way
;
and
convert
the
law
of
Moses
into
the
worship
of
a
being
,
which
ye
say
shall
come
many
hundred
years
hence
.
And
now
behold
,
I
,
Sherem
,
declare
unto
you
,
that
:
this
is
blasphemy
;
for
no
man
knoweth
of
such
things
:
for
he
cannot
tell
of
things
tocome
.
And
after
this
manner
did
-
Sherem
contend
against
me
.
But
behold
,
the
Lord
God
poured
in
his
spirit
into
my
soul
,
insdmuch
that
J
did
confound
him
ia
all
his
words
.
And
I
said
unto
him
,
deniest
thou
the
Christ
whe
should
come
?
And
he
said
,
if
there
should
be
a
Christ
,
I
would
not
deny
him
;
but
I
knew
that
there
is
no
Christ
,
neither
has
been
,
nor
ever
will
be
.
And
I
said
unto
him
,
belieyest
thou
the
Scriptures
?
And
he
said
,
yea
.
And
I
said
unto
him
,
then
[File:149]
ye
.
do
not
understand
them
;
for
they
truly
testify
of
Christ
.
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
none
of
the
rophets
have
written
,
nor
prophesied
,
save
they
lege
spoken
concerning
.
this
Christ
.
And
this
is
not
all
:
it
has
been
made
manifest
unto
me
,
for
I
have
heard
and
seen
;
and
it
also
hay
been
made
manifest
unto
me
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;
wherefore
,
I
know
if
there
should
be
no
atonement
made
all
mankind
must
be
lost
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
me
,
shew
me
a
sign
by
this
power
of
the
Holy
-
Ghost
,.
in
the
which
ye
know
so
much
.
And
I
said
unto
him
,
what
am
I
,
that
I
should
tempt
God
to
shew
unto
thee
a
sign
,
in
the
thing
which
thou
knowest
te
be
true
!
-
Yet
thou
wilt
deny
it
,
because
thou
art
of
the
devil
.
Nevertheless
,
not
my
will
be
done
;
but
if
God
,
shall
smite
thee
,
let
that
be
a
sign
unto
thee
that
he
has
power
,
both
in
heaven
and
m
earth
;
and
also
,
that
Christ
shall
come
.
And
thy
will
,
Q
Lord
,
be
done
,
and
not
mine
.
'
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
T
,
Jacob
,
bad
spoken
these
words
,
the
power
of
the
Lord
came
.
upon
him
,
insomuch
that
he
fell
to
the
earth
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
nourished
for
the
space
of
many
days
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
the
people
,
gather
together
on
the
morrow
,
for
I
shall
die
;
wherefore
,
I
desire
to
speak
unto
the
people
before
I
shall
die
.
.
And
it
-
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morfow
,
the
multitude
were
gathered
together
;
and
he
spake
plainly
unto
them
,
and
denied
the
things
which
he
had
taught
them
;
and
confessed
the
Christ
,
and
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
and
the
ministering
of
angels
..
And
he
spake
plainly
unto
them
,
that
he
had
been
deceived
by
the
power
of'
the
devil
.
And
he
spake
of
hell
,
and
of
eternity
,
and
of
eternal
punishment
.
And
he
said
,
I
fear
lest
{
have
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
,
for
I
have
lied
unto
.
God
:
for]
denied
.
the
Christ
,
and
said
that
I
believed
the
scriptures
;
and
they
truly
testify
of
him
.
'
And
because
I
have
thus
lied
unto
God
,
I
greatly
fear
lest
my
case
shall
be
awful
;
but
I
confess
unto
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
said
these
words
,
he
could
say
no
more
:
and
he
gave
up
the
host
.
And
when
the
multitude
had
witnessed
that
e
spake
these
things
as
he
was
about
to
give
up
the
ghost
,
they
were
astonished
exceedingly
;
insomuch
,
[File:150]
that
the
power
of
God
came
down
upon
:
them
,
and
they
were
overcome
,
that
they
fell
to
the
earth
.
Now
,
this
thing
was
pleasing
unto
me
,
Jacob
;
for
1
had
re

quested
it
of
my
Father
who
was
in~heaven
:
for
he
had
heard
-
my
ery
,
and
arswered
my
prayer
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
peace
and
the
love
of
God
,
was
restored
again
among
the
pecpte
;.
and
they
searched
the
scriptures
,
and
hearkened
no
mors
?
to
the
words
of
this
wicked
man
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
many
means
were
devised
,
to
reclaim
and
restore
the
Lamanites
,
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
;
but
it
-
all
were
vain
:
for
they
delighted
in
wars
and
bloodsheds
;
and
they
had
an
eternal
hatred
against
us
,
their
breth
ren
.
And
they
sought
by
the
power
of
their
arms
to
destroy
us
continually
;
wherefore
,
the
people
of
Nephi
cid
fortify
against
them
with
their
armies
,
and
with
all
their
might
,
trusting
in
the
God
and
rock
of
their
salvation
;
wherefore
,
they
became
as
yet
,
conquerors
of
their
enemics
.
And
it
came
to

that

THE
BOOK
OF
ENOS
.
CHAPTER
I
.:
Benorp
,
it
eame
to
pass
that
I
,
Enos
,
knowing
my
father
,
that
he
was
a
juct
man
:
for
he
taught
me
.
in
his
language
,
and
also
in
the
nurture
and
admonition
ofthe
Lord
.
And
blessed
be
the
name
of
my
-
God
-
for
it
,
And
I
will
tell
you
of
the
wrestle
which
I
had
before
God
,
before
I
receiveda
remission
of
my
sins
:
behold
,
went
to
hunt
beasts
in
the
forest
;
and
the
words
which
I
had
often
heard
my
father
speak
,
concerning
eternal
life
,
and
the
joy
of
the
saints
,
sunk
deep
into
my
heart
.
And
my
soul
hungered
;
and
I
kneeled
down
before
my
Maker
,
and
I
cried
unto
him
in
mighty
prayer
and
supplication
,
for
mine
own
soul
;
and
all
the
day
long
did
I
ery
unto
him
;
yea
,
and
when
the
night
came
,
[
did
still
raise
my
voice
high
,
that
it
reached
the
heavens
.
And
there
came
a
voice
unto
me
saying
,
Enos
,
thy
sins
are
forgiven
thee
,
and
thou
shalt
be
blessed
.
And
1
,
Enos
knew
that
God
could
not
Jie
;
wherefore
,
my
guill
was
swept
away
..
And
I
said
,
Lord
,
how
is
it
done
?
And
he
said
unto
me
,
because
of
thy
faith
in
Christ
,
whom
thou
hast
never
before
heard
nor
seen
.
And
many
years
pass
away
,
before'
he
shall
manifest
himself
in
the
flesh
;
wherefore
,
go
to
,
thy
faith
hath
made
thee
.
whole
.
Now
,
it
came
to
pass
that
when
J
had
heard
these
words
,
I
began
to
feel
a
desire
for
.
the
welfare
of
my
brethren
,
the
Nephites
;
wherefore
,
I
did
pour
out
my
whole
soul
unto
God
for
them
.
And
while
was
thus
struggling
in
.
the
spirit
,
behold
,
the
voice
of
the
Lord
:
came
into
my
mind
again
,
saying
,
I
will
visit
thy
brethren
,
according
to
their
diligence
in
keeping
my
commandments
.
{have
given
unto
them
this
land
;
and
it
is
a
holy
Jand
;
and
Leeurse
it
not
,
save
it
be
for
the
causeof
iniquity
;
wherefore
,
I
will
visit
thy
brethren
,
according
ag
I
have
said
;
and
their
transgressions
will
I
bring
down
with
sorrow
upon
their
own
heads
.
And
afierJ
,
Enos
,
had
heard
these
words
,
my
faith
began
to
be
unshaken
in
the
Lord
;
and
I
prayedunto
him
with
many
long
strugglings'
for
my
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
.
[File:152]
And
it
came
to
pass
,
that
after
I
had
prayed
,
and
labored
with
all
diligence
,
the
Lord
said
unto
me
,
J
will
grant
unto
thee
according
to
thy
desires
,
because
of
thy
faith
.
And
now
behold
,
this
was
the
desire
which
I
desired
of
him
:
Thatifit
should
so
be
,
that
my
people
,
the
Nephites
,
should
fall
into
transgres
.
sion
,
and
by
any
means
be
destroyed
,
and
the
Lamanites
should
not
be
destroyed
,
thatthe
Lord
God
would
preserve
a
record
of
my
people
,
the
Nephites
;
even
if
it
so
be
,
by
the
power
of
his
holy
arm
,
that
it
might
be
brought
forth
,
at
-
some
future
day
,
unto
the
Lamanites
,
that
perhaps
they
might
be
brought
unto
salvation
:
for
at
the
present
,
our
strugglings
were
vain
,
in
restoring
them
to
the
true
faith
.
And
they
swore
in
their
wrath
,
that
if
it
were
possible
,
they
would
destroy
our
records
and
us
;
and
,
also
,
all
the
traditions
of
our
fathers
.
Wherefore
,
I
knowing
that
the
Lord
God
was
able
to
preserve
our
records
,
I
cried
unto
him
continually
;
for
he
had
said
unto
me
,
whatsoever
thing
ye
shall
ask
in
faith
,
believing
that
ye
shall
receive
in
the
name
of
Christ
,
ye
shall
receive
it
.
And
I
had
faith
,
and
I
did
ery
unto
God
,
that
he
would
preserve
the
records
;
and
he
covenanted
with
me
that
he
would
bring
them
forth
unto
the
Lamanites
,
in
his
own
due
time
.
And
I
,
Enos
,
knew
it
would
be
according
to
the
covenant
which
he
had
made
;
wherefore
,
my
soul
did
rest
..
And
the
Lord
said
unto
me
,
thy
fathers
have
also
re
quired
of
me
this
thing
;
and
it
shall
be
done
unto
them
according
to
their
faith
,
for
their
faith
was
like
unto
thine
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
,
that
I
,
Enos
,
went
about
among
the
people
of
Nephi
,
prophesying
of
things
to
come
,
and
testifying
of
the
things
which
I
had
heard
and
seen
.
And
I
bear
record
that
the
people
of
Nephi
did
seek
diligently
to
restore
the
Lamanites
unto
the
true
faith
in
God
.
But
our
labors
were
vain
;
their
hatred
was
fixed
,
and
they
were
led
by
their
evil
na
ture
,
that
they
became
wild
,
and
ferocious
,
and
a
blood
thirsty
people
;
full
of
idolatry
,
and
filthiness
;
feeding
upon
beasts
of
prey
,
dwelling
in
tents
,
and
wandering
about
in
the
wilderness
,
witha
short
skin
girdle
about
their
loins
,
and
their
heads
shaven
;
and
their
skill
was
in
the
bow
,
and
in
the
cymeter
,
and
the
axe
.
.
And
many
of
,
them
did
.
eat
.
nothing
.
save
it
.
was
raw
meat
;
and
they
were
-
continually
seeking
to
destroy
us
.
[File:153]
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
Nephi
did
till
the
land
,
and
raise
all
manner
of
grain
,
and
of
fruit
,
and
flocks
of
herds
,
and
flocks
of
all
manner
of
cattle
;
of
every
kind
,
and
goats
,
and
wild
goats
,
and
also
many
horses
.
And
there
were
exceeding
many
prophets
among
us
.
And
the
people
were
a
stiff
-
necked
people
,
hard
to
understand
.
And
there
was
nothing
save
it
was
exceeding
harshness
,
preaching
and
prophesying
of
wars
,
and
contentions
,
and
destructions
,
and
continually
reminding
them
of
death
,
and
the
duration
of
eternity
,
and
the
judgments
and
the
power
of
Ged
;
and
all
these
things
stirring
them
up
continually
,
to
keep
them
in
the
fear
of
the'Lord
.
I
say
there
-
was
nothing
short
of
these
things
,
and
exceeding
great
plainness
of
speech
,
would
keep
them
from
going
down
speedily
to
destruction
.
And
after
this
manner
do
I
write
concerning
them
.
And
I
saw
wars
between
the
Nephites
and
Lamanites
,
in
the
course
of
my
days
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
began
to
be
old
,
and
an
hundred
and
seventy
and
nine
years
had
passed
away
from
the
time
that
our
father
Lehi
left
Jerusalem
..
Andas
I
saw
that
I
must
soon
go
down
to
my
grave
,
having
been
wrought
upon
by
the
power
of
God
that
I
must
preach
and
prophesy
unto
this
people
,
and
declare
the
word
according
to
the
truth
which
is
in
Christ
.
And
T
have
declared
it
,
in
all
my
days
,
and
have
rejoiced
in
it
,
above
that
of
the
world
.
AndI
soon
go
to
the
place
of
my
rest
,
which
is
with
my
Redeemer
;
for
I
know
thatin
him
I
shall
rest
:
and
I
rejoice
in
the
day
when
my
mortal
shall
put
on
immortality
,
and
shall
stand
betore
him
:
then
shall
I
see
his
face
with
pleasure
,
and
he
will
say
unto
me
,
come
unto
me
ye
blessed
,
there
is

place
prepared
for
you
in

mansions

of

[File:154]

of
our

the
Lamanites

wherefore
,
it
must

be
that
I

;
but
L
shall
not

things

of

tions
.
For
what
could
write
more
than
my
fathers
have
written
?
For
have
not
they
revealed
the
plan
of
salvation
?
I
say
unto
you
,
yea
;
and
this
sufficeth
me
.
Behold
,
it
is
expedient
that
much
should
be
done
among
this
people
,
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
,
and
the
deafness
of
their
ears
,
and
the
blindness
of
their
minds
,
and
the
stiffness
of
their
necks
;
nevertheless
,
God
is
exceeding
merciful
unto
them
,
and
has
not
as
yet
swept
them
off
from
the
face
of
the
land
.
And
there
are
many
among
us
who
have
many
revelations
:
for
they
are
not
all
stiffmecked
,
And
as
many
ag
are
not
stiiiecked
,
and
have
faith
,
have
commanion
with
the
Holy
Spirit
,
which
maketh
inanifest
unto
the
children
of
men
,
according
to
their
faith
.
And
now
,
behold
,
two
hundred
years
had
passed
away
,
and
the
people
of
Nephi
had
waxed
strong
in
the
land
.
They
observed
to
keep
the
law
of
Moses
,
and
the
Sabbath
day
holy
unto
the
Lord
.
And
they
profaned
not
;
neither
did
they
blaspheme
,
And_
the
laws
of
the
land
were
exceeding
strict
.
And
.
they
were
scattered
upon
much
of
the
face
of
the
land
;
and
the
Lamanites
also
.
And
they
were
exceeding
more
numerous
than
were
they
of
the
Nephites
;
and
they
loved
murder
,
and
would
drink
the
blood
of
beasts
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
;
many
.
times
against
us
,
the
Nephites
,
to
battle
.
But
our
kings
and
our
leaders
were
mighty
men
in
the
faith
of
the
Lord
:
and
they
taught
the
people
the
ways
of
the
Lord
;.
wherefore
,
we
withstood
the
Lamanites
,
and
swept
thein
away
out
of
our
lands
,
and
began
.
to
fortify
our
cities
,
or
whatsoever
place
of
our
inheritance
..
nd
we
multiplied
exceedingly
,
and
spread
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
became
exceeding
rich
in
gold
,
and
in
silver
,
and
in
precious
things
,
and
in
fine
workmanship
of
wood
,
in
buildings
,
and
in
machinery
,
and
also
in
iron
,
and
copper
,
and
brass
,
and
:
steel
,
making
all
manner
of
tools
of
every
kind
to
till
the
ground
,
and
weapons
of
war
;
yea
,
the
sharp
pointed
arrow
,
and
the
quiver
,
and
the
dart
,
and
the
javelin
,
and
all
preparations
for
war
;
and
thus
being
prepared
to
.
meet
the
Lamanites
,
they
did
not
prosper
against
us
.
.
But
the
word
of
the
Lord
.
was
,
verified
,
whieh
,
he
spake
ung
[File:155]
to
.
our
fathers
,
saying
,
That
inasmuch
as
ye
will
.
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
...
;
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
prophets
of
the
Lord
did
threaten
the
people
of
Nephi
,
according
,
to
.
the
word
of
God
,
that
if
they
did
not
keep
the
commandments
,
but
should
fill
into
transgression
,
they
should
be
destroyed
from
off
the
face
of
the
land
;
where
-
ore
,
the
prophets
,
and
.
the
priests
,
and
the
teachers
,
did
Jabor
diligently
,
exhorting
with
all
long
suffering
,
.
the
people
to
diligence
;
teaching
the
law
of
Moses
,
and
the
intent
for
which
it
was
given
;
persuading
them
to
look
forward
unto
the
Moassiah
,
and
believe
in
him
to
come
,
as
though
he
already
was
.
And
after
this
manner
did
they
teach
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
by
so

,
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Omni
,
being
commanded
by
my
father
Jarom
,
that
I
should
write
somewhat
upon
these
plates
,
to
preserve
our
genealogy
;
wherefore
,
in
my
days
,
would
that
ye
should
know
that
.
I
fought
.
much
with
the
sword
,
to
preserve
my
people
,
the
Nephites
,
from
falling
into
the
hands
.
of
their
enemies
,
the
Lamanites
.
But
behold
,
I
,
of
myself
,
am
.
a
wicked
.
man
,
and
I
have
not
.
kept
the
stats
Â©
[File:156]
utes
and
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
,
as
I
ought
to
have
done
.
And
it
came
te
pass
that
two
hundred
and
seventy
and
six
years
had
passed
away
,
and
we
had
many
seasons
of
peace
;
and
we
had
many
seasons
of
serious
war
and
bloodshed
.
Yea
,
and
in
fine
,
two
hundred
and
eighty
and
two
years
had
passed
away
,
and
I
had
kept
these
plates
according
to
the
commandments
of
my
fathers
;
and
I
conferred
them
upon
my
son
Amaron
.
And
I
make
an
end
.
And
now
J]
,
Amaron
,
write
the
things
whatsoever
I
write
,
which
are
few
,
in
the
book
of
my
father
.
Behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
three
hundred
and
twenty
years
had
passed
away
,
and
the
more
wicked
part
of
the
Nephites
were
destroyed
:
for
the
Lord
would
net
suffer
,
after
he
had
led
them
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
and
kept
and
preserved
them
:
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
;
yea
,
he
would
not
suffer
that
the
words
should
not
be
verified
,
which
he
spake
unto
our
fathers
,
saying
,
that
inasmuch
as
ve
will
not
keep
~
commandments
,
ye
shall
not
prosper
in
the
land
.
Wherefore
,
the
Lord
did
visit
them
in
great
judgment
;
nevertheless
,
he
did
spare
the
righteous
,
that
they
should
not
perish
,
but
did
deliver
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
deliver
the
plates
unto
my
brother
Chemish
.
Now
I
,
Chemish
,
write
what
few
things
I
write
,
in
the
same
book
with
my
brother
:
for
behold
,
I
saw
the
last
which
he
wrote
,
that
he
wrote
it
with
his
own
hand
;
and
he
wrote
it
in
the
day
that
he
delivered
them
unto
me
.
And
after
this
manner
we
keep
the
records
,
for
it
is
according
to
the
commandments
of
our
fathers
.
And
I
make
an
end
.
Behold
,
I
,
Abinadom
,
am
the
son
of
Chemish
.
Behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
F
saw
:
much
war
and
contention
between
my
people
,
the
Nephites
,
and
the
Lamanites
;
and
I
,
with
mine
own
sword
,
have
taken
the
lives
of
many
of
the
Lamanites
,
in
the
defence
of
my
brethren
.
And
behold
,
the
record
of
this
people
is
engraven
upon
plates
which
is
had
by
the
kings
,
according
.
to
the
generations
;
and
I
know
of
no
revelation
,
save
that
which
has
been
written
,
neither
prophecy
;
wherefore
,
that
which
is
sufficient
,
is
written
.
And
!
make
an
end
.
Behold
,
1am
Amaleki
,;
the
son
of
Abinadom
:
Behold
,
I
will
speak
unto
:
you'somewhat
conceming
Mosiah
,
who
was
made
king
over
the
land
of
Zarahemls
:
[File:157]
for
behold
,
he
being
warned
of
the
Lord
:
that
he
should
flee
out
of
the
land
of
Nephi
,
and
as
many
as
would
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
Lord
,
should
also
depart
out
of
the
land
with
him
,
into
the
wilderness
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
according
as
the
Lord
had
commanded
him
.
And
they
departed
out
of
the
land
into'the
wilderness
,
as
many
as
would
heaarken
unto
the
voice
of
the
Lord
;
and
they
were
led
by
ma
ny
preachings
and
prophesyings
.
And
they
were
ad
monished
continually
by
the
word
of
God
;
and
they
were
led
by
the
power
of
his
arm
,
through
the
wilderness
,
until
they
came
down
into
the
land
which
is
called
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
And
they
discovered
a
people
,
who
were
called
the
people
of
Zarahemla
,.
Now
,
there
was
great
rejoicing
among
the
people
of
Zarahemla
;
and
also
,
Zarahemla
did
rejoice
exceedingly
,
because
the
Lord
had
sent
the
people
of
Mosiah
with
the
plates
of
brass
which
contained
the
record
of
the
Jews
.
Behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
Mosiah
discovered
that
the
people
of
Zarahemla
,
came
out
from
Jerusalem
,
at
the
time
that
Zedekiah
,
king
of
Judah
,
was
carried
away
caplive
into
Babylon
.
And
they
journied
in
the
wilderness
,
and
were
brought
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
across
the
great
waters
,
into
the
land
where
Mosiah
discovered
them
;
and
they
had
dwelt
there
from
that
fime
forth
.
And
at
the
time
that
Mosiah
discovered
them
,
they
had
become
exceeding
numerous
.
Nevertheless
,
they
had
had
many
wars
and
serious
contentions
,
and
:
had
fallen
by
the
sword
from
time
to
time
;
and
their
language
had
become
corrupted
;
and
they
had
brought
no
records
with
them
;
and
they
denied
the
being
of
their
Creator
;
and
Mosiah
,
nor
the
people
of
Mosiah
,
could
understand
them
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
Mosiah
caused
thatthey
should
be
taught
in
his
language
.
And
it
came
to
ass
that
after
they
were
taught
in
the
language
of
Mosiah
,
Zarahemla
gave
a
genealogy
of
his
fathers
,
according
to
his
memory
;
and
they
are
written
,
but
not
in
these
plates
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
Zarahemla
,
and
of
Mosiah
,
did
unite
together
;
and
Mosiah
was
appointed
to
be
their
king
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
days
of
Mosiah
,
there
was
a
large
stone
brought
unto
him
,
with
engravings
on
it
;
and
he
did
interpret
the
engravings
,
by
the
gift
and
power
of
God
...
[File:158]
And
they
gave
an
aecount
of
one
Coriantumr
,
and
the
slain
of
his
people
.
And
Coriantumr
was
discoyered
by
the
people
of
Zarahemla
;
and
he
dwelt
with
them
for
the
space
of
nine
moons
.
It
also
spakea
few
words'
concerning
his
fatsers
.
And
his
first
parents
.
came
out
from
the
lower
,
at
the
time
the
Lord
confounded
the
language
of
the
people
;
and
.
the
sever
.
ity
of
the
Lord
fell
upon
them
,
according
to
his
judgments
,
which
are
just
;
and
their
bones
lay
scattered
in'
the
land
northward
.
Behold
,
1
,
Amaleki
,
was
born
in
the
days
of
Mosiah
;
and
I
have
lived
to
see
his
death
;
and
Benjamin
,
hig
son
,
reigneth
in
his
stead
.
And
behold
,
[
have
seen
in
the
days
of
king
Benjamin
,
a
serious
war
,
and
much
bloodshed
,
between
the
Nephites
and
the
Lamanites
,
But
behold
,
the
Nephites
did
obtain
much
advantage
over
them
;
yea
,
insomuch
that
king
Benjamin
did
drive
them
out
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
began
to
he
old
;
and
,
having
no
seed
,
and
knowing
king
Benjamin
to
bea
just
man
before
the
Lerd
,
wherefore
,
shall
celiver
up
these
plates
unto
hint
,
exhorting
all
men
to
come
unto
God
,
the
Holy
One
ofIsrael
,
and
believe
in
prophesying
,
and
in
revelations
,
and
in
the
ministering
of
ang
sls
,
and
in
the
giftof
speaking
with
tongues
,
and
in
the
gift
of
interpreting
languages
,
and
in
all
things
which
are
good
:
for
there
is
nothing
which
is
good
,
save
it
comes
from
the
Lord
;
and
that
which
is
evil
,
cometh
from
the
devil
.
And
now
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
IT
would
that
ye
should
come
unto
Christ
,
who
is
the
Holy
One
of
Israel
,
and
partake
of
his
salvation
,
and
the
power
of
his
redemption
,
Yea
,
come
unto
him
,
and
offer
your
whole
souls
.
as
an
offering
unto
him
,
and
continue
in
fasting
and'
praying
,
and
endure
to
the
end
;
and
as
the
Lord
liveth
,
ye
will
be
saved
.
.
And
now
,
I
would
speak
somewhat
concerning
@
certain
number
who
went
up
into
the
wilderness
,
to
return
to
the
land
of
Nephi
:
for
there
was
a
large
number
who
were
desirous
to
possess
the
land
of
their
inheritance
;
wherefore
,
they
went
up
into
the
wilderness

Alnd
their
leader

being
a
strong
and
a
mighty
man
,
anda

man
,
wherefore
he
caused

among
them
;
dnd
they
were
all
slain

in

,
and
they
returned
again

that

contain

revelations
,

put
them
with

I

thus
it

eth
me

according

is
concerning

that
they
may

the

Mormon
,
proceed
to
finish
out
my
ree
.
ord
,
which
I
take
from
the
plates
of
Nephi
;
and
I
make
it
according
to
the
knowledge
and
the
under
.
standing
which
God
has
given
me
.
Wherefore
,.
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Amaleki
had
delivered
up
these
plates
into
the
hands
of
king
Benjamin
,
he
took
them
and
put
them
with
the
other
plates
,
which
contained
records
.
which
.
had
been
-
handed
down
by
the
kings
,
from
generation
to
generation
,
until
the
days
of
king
Benjamin
;
and
.
they
were
handed
down
from
king
Benjamin
,
from
generation
to
generation
,
until
they
have
fallen
into
my
hands
.
And
I
,
Mormon
,
pray
to
God
that
they
may
be
preserved
,
from
this
.
time
henceforth
.
AndI
know
that
.
they
will
be
preserved
:
for
there
are
great
things
written
upon
them
,
out
of
which
my
people
and
their
brethren
,
shall
be
judged
at
the
great
and
last
day
,
according
to
,
the
word
of
God
which
is
written
.
;
And
now
,
concerning
this
king
Benjamin
:
He
had
somewhat
contentions
among
his
own
people
,
And
it
came
to
pass
also
,
that
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
came
down
out
of
the
land
of
Nephi
,
to
battle
against
his
people
.
But
behold
,
king
Benjamin
gathered
topater
bis
armies
,
and
he
did
:
stand
against
them
;,
and
e
did
fight
with
the
strength
of
his
own
arm
,
with
the
ta
of
Laban
;
and
in
the
strength
of
.
the
Lord
they
did
-
contend
against
their
enemies
,
until
they
had
slain
many
.
thousands
of
the
Lamanites
,
And
it
came
to

pags
:
that
.
they

until
they

had
driven
them
out
of
all
the
lands

;
And
it
came
to
pass
:
that
after
there
had
been
false
christs
,
and
their
mouths
had
beenshut
,
and
they
punished
according
to
their
crimes

after
there
had

been
false

false

contentions

many
dissensions

away
unto

behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Benjamin
,
with
the
assistance
of
the
holy
prophets
who
were
among

people
:
for
behold
,
king
Benjamin
was
a
holy
man
,
and
he
did
reign
-
over
his
people
in
righteousness
.
And
there
.
were
many
holy
men
-
in
the
land
;
and
they
did
speak
the
word
of
God
,
with
power
and
with
authority
;
and
they
did
use
much
sharpness
because
of
the

of

,
with

of

THE
BOOK
OF
MOSIAH
.
_
CHAPTER
I
.
Axp
now
there
was
no
more
contention
in
all
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
among
all
the
people
who
belonged
to
king
Benjamin
,
so
that
:
king
Benjamin
had
.
continual
peace
all
the
remainder
.
of
his
days
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
hexhad
three
sons
;
and
.-
he
called
their
names
-
Mosiah
,;
and
Helorum
,
and
.
Helaman
..
and
he
caused
that
they
should
be
taught
in
all
the
language
of
his
fathers
,
that
thereby
they
might
become
men
of
understanding
;
and
that
they
might
know
concerning
the
prophecies
which
had
been
spoken
by
the
mouths
of
their
fathers
;
which
were'
deliyered
them
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
.
And
.
he
:
also
taught
them
concerning
the
records
:
which
were
engraven
on
the
plates
of
brass
,
saying
,
my
sons
,
I
would
that
.
ye
should
remember
,
that
were
.
jt
not
for
these
plates
;
which
contain
these
records
and
:.
these
commandments
,
we
must
have
suffered
:
in
.
ignorance
,
even
at
this
present
time
,
not
.
knowing
.
the
.
mysteries
of
God
:
for
it
were
not
:
possible
that
.
our
father
Lehi
could
have
remembered
all
these
things
,
to
have
taught
them
to
his
:
children
,
except
it
-
were>
for
the
help
:
of
these'plates
:
for
he
having
-
been
taightin
the
language
[File:162]
of
the
Egyptians
,
therefore
he
could
read
:
these
engravings
,
and
teach
them
to
his
children
;
that
:
thereby
they
could
:
teach
them
to
their
children
,
fand'so
fulfil
.
ling
the
commandments
of
God
,
evendown
to
this
present
time
.
I
say
unto
you
,
my
sons
,
were
iit
-
not
for
these
things
,
whieh
have
been
kept
and
preserved
by
the
hand
of
God
,
that
we
might
read
and
understand
of
his
anysteries
,
and
have
his
commandments
always
before
our
eyes
,
that
even
our
fathers
would
have
dwindled
in
unbelief
,-
and
.
we
should
have
been
like
unto
our
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
,
was
know
nothing
concerning
these
things
,
or
even
do
not
believe
them
when
they
.
are
taught
them
,
because
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
,
which
are
not
.
correct
.
O
my
-
sons
,
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
these
sayings
are
true
;
and
.
also
,
that
these
,
records
are
true
.
And
behold
,
also
the
plates
of
Nephi
,
which
contain
the
records
and
the
sayings
of
our
fathers
from
the
time
they
left
Jerusalem
,,
until
now
;
and
they
are
true
;
and
we
can
know
of
their
surety
,
because
we
have
them
before
our
eyes
.
And
now
,
my
sons
,
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
:
to
search
them
diligently
,
that
ye
may
profit
thereby
;
and
[
would
that
ye
should
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
that
ye
may
prosper
in
the
land
,
according
to
the
promises
which
the
Lord
made
unto
our
fathers
.
And
many
more
things
did
king
Benjathin
teach
his
sons
,
which
are
not
written
in
this
book
.
And
it
.
came
to
pass
:
that
after
king
Benjamin
had
made
an
end
of
teaching
his
sons
,
that
he
waxed
old
;
and
he
saw
that
he
must
verysoon
go
the
way
of
all
the
earth
;
therefore
,
he
thought
it
.
expedient
that
he
should
confer
the
kingdom
upon
one
of
his
sons
..
Therefore
,
he
had
Mosiah
brought
before
him
;
and
these
are
the
words
which
he
spake
unto
him
,
saying
:
My
son
,
I
would
that
ye
should
maxea
proclamation
throughout
all
this
land
,
among
all
this
people
,
or
the
people
of
Zarahemla
,
and
the
people
of
Mosiah
who
dwell
in
the
land
,
that
thereby
they
may
be
gathered
together
:
for
on
the
morrow
,
I
shall
proclaim
,
unto
this
my
people
,
out
of
mine
own
mouth
,
that
thou
art
a
kings
and
aruler
over
this
people
,
whom
the
Lord
our
.
God
hath
given
us
..
And
moreover
,
I
shalligive
this
people
a
name
,
that
.
thereby
they
may
be
.
distin
-
'
ished
above
allthe
people
which
-
the
Lord
God
hath
:
rought
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
;
and
this
I
do
,
because
they
have
.
been
a
:
diligent
people
in
keeping
[File:163]
the
-
commandments
.
ofthe
Lord
..
And
I
give
:.
anto
them
a
name
,
that
never
shall
be
blotted
out
,
except
it
be
through
.
.
transgression
.-
Yea
,
and
moreover
I
say
unto
you
,
that
-
if
this
highly
.
favored
people
of
the
Lord
should
fallinto
transgression
,
and
:
become'a
wicked
and
:
an
adulterous
people
,
that
the
Lord
will
deliver
them
up
,
that
thereby
:
they
become
weak
,
like
unto
their
brethren
;
and
he
will
no
.
more
preserve
,
them
,
by
his
matchless
.
and
marvelous
,
power
;
as
.
lie
.
has
hitherto
...
preserved
our
.
fathers
:
For
say
unto
you
,
that
.
if
he
had
not
extended
his
arm
inthe
preservation
of
our
fathers
,
they
must
havefallen
into
,
the
-
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
become
victimsto
their
hatred
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
king
Benjamin
had
made
an
end
of
these'sayings
to
his
son
,
that
he
gave
him
:
charge'
concerning
all
the
affairs
:
of
the
kingdom
.
And
moreover
,
he
also
.
gave
him
charge
concerning
the
records
which
were
engraven
on
the
-
plates
of
brass
;-
and
also
,
the
plates
-
of
Nephi
;
and
also
,
the
sword
.
of
Laban
,
and
:
the
ball
.
or
direetor
,
which
.
led
our
fathers
through
the
wilderness
,
which
was
prepared
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
that
.
thereby
they
might
be
led
,
every
one
according
to
the
heed
and
diligence
which
.
they
gave
unto
him
.
Therefore
,
as
they
were
unfaithful
,
they
did
not
prosper
nor
progress
in
their
journey
,-
but
were
driven
back
,
and
incurred
the
displeasure
of
God
upon
them
;
and
therefore
,
they
were
smitten
with
famine
and
sore
afflictions
;
to
stir
them
up
in
remembrance
of
their
duty
.
And
now
,
it
,
came
to
:
pass
that
Mosiah
went
and
did
as
his
father
had
commanded
him
,
and
proclaimed
unto
all
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
of
Zerahem
.
la
,
that
thereby
they
might
gather
themselyes
together
,
to
go
up
to
.
the
temple
,
to
hear
the
words
which
his
father
should
speak
unto
them
.

And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Mosiah
had
.
done
as
his
father
had
commanded
him
,
and
had
made
a
proelamation
throughout
all
the
land
,.
that
the
people
gathered
themselves
together
.
throughout
all
:
the'
land
)
that
they
might
go
up
to
the
temple
to
hear
the
words
which
king
Besscatis
should
speakunto
them
.
.
And
there
were
a
great
number
,
even
so
many
that
they
did
not
number
them
;
for
they
had
multiplied
exceeds
ingly
,
and
waxed
great
.
in
the
land
:.
And
:
they
also
took
of
the
firstlings
of
their
flocks
,
that
they
.
might
offer
:
sacrifice'
and
.
burnt
:
offerings
,
according
to
\the
law
of
Moses
;
and
also
,
that
they
might
give
thanks
[File:164]
to
the
Lord
their
.
God
,
who
had
brought
.
them
out
-
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,.
and
who
had
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
,
and
.
had
appointed
just
men
to
be
their
teachers
;
and
also
,
a
just
man
to
their
king
,
who
had
established
peace
in
the
land
of
Zerahemla
,
and
who
had
taught
them
to
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
that
they
might
rejoice
,
and
be
filled
with
love
towards
God
,
and
all
men
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
came
up
to
the
temple
,
they
pitched
their
tents
round
about
,
every
man
according
to'his
family
,
consisting
of
his
wife
,
and
his
sons
,
and
his
daughters
,
and
their
sons
,
and
their
daughters
,
from
the
eldest
down
to
the
youngest
,
every
family
being
separate
,
one
from
another
;
and
they
pitched
their
tents
round
about
the
temple
,
every
man
.
having
his
tent
with
the
door
thereof
towards
the
temple
,
that
thereby
they
might
remain
in
their
tents
,
and
hear
the
words
which
king
Benjamin
should
speak
unto
.
them
;
for
.
the
multitude
being
so
great
,
.
that
king
Benjamin
could
not
teach
them
all
within
the
walls
of
the
temple
;
therefore
he
caused
a
tower
to
be
erected
,
that
thereby
his
people
might
hear
the
words
which
he
should
speak
unto
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
began
to
speak
to
his
people
from
the
tower
;
and
they
could
.
not
all
hear
his
words
,
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
multitude
;
therefore
,
he
caused
that
the
words
which
he
spake
,
should
be
:
written'
and
sent
forth
among
those
that
were
not
under
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
that
they
might
also
receive
his
words
.
And
:
these
are
the
.
words
which
he
spake
and
caused
.
to
be
written
,
saying
:
My
brethren
,

in

labored
with
mine

that

might
serve

that

:
that

of
all
these
things
which
I
dart
spoken

witnesses
this
day

Yet
,
my

,
1
have
not
done
these
things
that
I
might
boast
,
neither
do
I
tell
these
things

I
might
accuse
you

I
tell
you
these
things

that
ye

know
that
I
can
answera

this
day

Behold
,
I
say
unto

that
because
I
said
unto

that
I
had
spent
my
days
in

I
do
not

And
behold

I
tell

ye
are
only
in

,
ye

be

to
keep
his
commandments
;
and
he
has
promised
you
that
if
ye
would
keep
his
commandments
,
ye
should
prosper
in
the
land
;
and
he
never
doth
vary
from
.
that
which
he
hath
said
;
therefore
,
if
ye
do
keep
his
commandments
,
he
doth
bless
you
,
and
prosper
you
.
And
now
,
inthe
first
place
,
he
hath
created
you
,
and
granted
unto
you
your
lives
,
for
.
which
ye
are
indebted
unto
him
.
And
.
secondly
:.
He
doth
require
that
ye
shoulddo
as
he
hath
commanded
:
you
,
for
:
which
if
ye
do
,
hedoth
immediately
blessyou
;
und
therefore
,
he
hath
paid
you
.:
And
ye
are
still
indebted
unto
him
;
and
are
,
and
will
be
,
forever
and
ever
;
therefore
,
of
what
.
have
ye
to
boast
?
And
now
Task
,
can
ye
say
aught
of
..
yourselyes
?
I
answer
.
you
,
nay
.
Ye
cannot
say'
that
ye
are
even
as
much
ag
the
dust
of
the
earth
:
yet
ye
were
created
of
the
.
dust
of
the
earth
:
but
.
behold
,
it
belongeth
.
to
him
who
created
you
.
And
I
,
even
I
,
whomye

king
,
am
no
better
than

are
;
for

And
ye
behold
that
I
am
old
,
and
am
about
to
yield
up
this
mortal
frame
to
its

earth
;
therefore
,
as

you
that

had
served

you
,
walking
with
a
clear
conscrence
before
God
,
even
so
I
at
this
time
have
caused
that
ye
should
assemble
yourselves
together
,
that
I
might
be
found
blameless
,
and
:
that

I

unto

that
I
have
caused

the

hath

and
have
been
kept
from

into
the
hands
of
your
enemies
,
even
so
if
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of

or
the
commandments
of
God
,
which
shall
be
delivered
unto
you
by

,
ye
shallprosper
in

,
and
your
enemies
shall
have
no
power
over
you
.
But
O
my
people
,
beware
lest
there
shall
arise
contentions
among
you
,
and
ye
list
to
obay
the
evil
spirit
,
which
was
spoken
of
by
my
father
Mosiah
.
For
behold
,
there
is
a
wo
pronounced
upon
him
who
listeth
to
obey
that
spirit
;
tor
if
he
listeth
to
obey
him
,
and
remaineth
and
dieth
in
his
sins
,
the
same
drinketh
damnation
to
his
own
soul
;
for
hesreceiveth
for
his
wages
an
everlasting
punishment
;
having
transgressed
the
law
of
God
,
contrary
to
his
own
knowledge
.
1
say
unto
you
,
that
there
are
not
any
among
you
,
except
it
be
your
little
children
,
that
have
not
been
taught
concerning
these
things
;
but
what
knoweth
that
ye
are
eternaliy
indebted
to
your
heavenly
Father
,
to
render
to
-
him
all
that
you
have
,
and
are
,
and
also
have
been
taught
,
concerning
the
records
which
contain
the
prophecies
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
holy
prophets
,
even
down
to
the
time
our
father
Lehi
left
Jerusalem
;
and
also
,
all
that
has
been
spoken
by
our
fathers
,
until
now
.
And
behold
,
also
,
they
spake
that
which
was
commanded
them
ofthe
Lord
;
therefore
,
they
are
just
and
true
.
And
-
now
,
I
say
unto
you
,
my
brethren
,
that
after
ye
have
knowniand
have
been
-
taught
all
these
things
,
if
ye
should
transgress
,
and
go
contrary
to
that
which
has
been
spoken
,
that
ye
do
withdraw
yourselves
from
the
Spirit
of
the
Lord
,
that
it
may
have
no
place
in
you
to
guide
you
in
wisdom's
paths
,
that
ye
may
be
blessed
,
prospered
,
and
preserved
.
I
say
unto
you
,
that
the
man
that
do2th
this
;
the
same
cometh
out
in
open
rebellion
against
God
;
therefore
he
listeth
to
obey
the
evil
spirit
,
and
becometh
an
enemy
to
all
righteousness
;
therefore
,
the
Lord
has
no
place
in
him
,
for
he
dwelleth
not
in'unholy
temples
.
Therefore
,
if
that
man
repenteth
not
,
and
remaineth
and
dieth
an
enemy
to
God
,
the
demands
of
divine
justice
doth
awaken
his
immortal
soul
to
a
lively
sense
of
his
own
guilt
,
which
doth
cause
-
him
te
shrink
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
,
and
doth
fill
his
breast
with
guilt
,
and
pain
,
and
anguish
,
which
is
like
an
unquenchable
fire
,
whose
flames
ascendeth
up
forever
and
ever
.
And
riow
I
say
[File:168]
unto
you
,
that
merey
hath
no
claim
on
that
man
;
therefore
,
his
final
doom
is
to
endure
a
never
ending
torment
.
O
all
ye
old
men
,
and
also
ye
young
men
,
and
you
little
children
,
who
ean
.
understand
my
words
,
(
for
I
have
spoken
plain
unto
you
,
that
ye
might
understand
,
)
I
pray
that
ye
should
awake
to
a
remembrance
of
the
awful
situation
of
those
that
have
fallen
into
transgression
;
and
moreover
,
I
would
desire
that
ye
should
consider
on
the
blessed
and
happy
state
of
these
that
keep
the
commandments
of
God
.
For
behold
,
they
are
blessed
in
all
things
,
both
temporal
and
spiritual
;
and
if
they
hold
out
faithful
to
the
end
,
they
are
received
into
heaven
,
that
thereby
they
may
dwell
with
God
in
a
state
of
never
ending
happiness
.
O
remem
.
ber
,
remember
that
these
things
are
true
;
for
the
Lord
God
hath
spoken
it
,
And
again
my
brethren
,
[would
call
your
attention
,
for
have
somewhat
more
to
speak
unto
you
:
for
behold
,
[
have
things
to
:
tell
you
,
concerning
that
which
is
to
come
;
and
the
things
which
1
shall
tell
you
,
are
made
known
unto
me
,
by
an
angel
from
God
.
And
he
said
unto
me
,
awake
;
and
I
awoke
,
and
behold
,
he
stood
before
me
.
And
he
said
unto
me
,
awake
,
and
hear
the
words
which
I
shall
tell
thee
:
for
behold
,
1
am
come
to
declare
unto
you
the
glad
tidings
of
great
joy
.
For
the
Lord
bath
heard
thy
prayers
,
and
hath
judged
of
thy
righteousness
,
ond
hath
sent
me
.
tode
clare
unto
thee
that
thou
mayest
rejoice
;
and
that
thou
mayest
declare
unto
thy
peopie
,
that
they
may
also
be
filled
with
joy
.
For
behold
,
the
time
cometh
,
and
is
not
far
distant
,
that
with
power
,
the
Lord
Ounipotent
who
reigneth
,
who
was
,
and
is
from
alleternity
to
all
eternity
,
shall
come
down
from
heaven
,
among
the
children
of
men
,
and
shull
dwell
in
a
tabernacle
of
clay
,
and
shall
go
forth
amongst
men
,
working
mighty
miracles
,
such
as
healing
the
sick
,
raising
the
dead
,
causing
the
lame
to
walk
,
the
blind
to
receive
their
sight
,
and
the
deaf
to
hear
,
and
curing
all
manner
of
diseases
;
and
he
shall
cast
out
devils
,
or
the
evil
spirits
which
dwell
in
the
bearts
of
the
children
of
men
.
And
lo
,
he
shall
suffer
temptations
,
and
pain
of
body
,
hunger
,
thirst
,
and
fatigue
,
even
more
than
man
can
suffer
,
except
it
be
unto
death
:
for
behold
,
blood
cometh
from
every
pore
,
so
great
shall
be
his
anguish
for
the
wickedness
and
the
abominations
of
his
people
.
And
he
shall
be
called
Jesus
[File:169]
Christ
,
the
Son
of
God
,
the
Father
of
heaven
and
earth
,
the
creator
of
all
things
,
from
the
beginning
;
and
his
mother
shall
be
called
Mary
.
And
lo
,
he
cometh
unto
his
own
,
that
salvation
might
come
unto
the
children
of
men
,
even
through
faith
on
his
name
;
and
even
after
al
!
this
,
they
shalt
consider
him
a
man
,
and
say
that
he
bath
a
devil
,
and
shall
scourge
him
,
and
shall
crucify
him
.
And
he
shall
rise
the
third
day
from
the
dead
;
and
behold
,
he
standeth
to
judge
the
world
.
And
behold
,
all
these
things
are
done
,
that
a
righteous
judgment
might
come
upon
the
children
of
men
.
For
behold
,
and
also
his
blood
atoneth
for
the
sins
of
those
who
have
fallen
by
the
transgression
of
Adam
,
who
have
died
,
not
knowing
the
will
of
God
concerning
them
,
or
who
have
ignorantly
sinned
.
But
wo
,
wo
unto
him
who
knoweth
that
he
-
rebelleth
against
God
:
for
salvation
cometh
to
none
such
,
except
it
be
through
repentance
and
faith
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
.
And
the
Lord
God
hath
sent
his
holy
prophets
among
all
the
children
of
men
,
to
.
declare
these
things
to
every
kindred
,
nation
,
and
tongue
,
that
thereby
whosoever
should
believe
that
Christ
should
come
,
the
same
might
receive
remission
of
their
sins
,
and
rejoice
with
exceeding
great
joy
,
even
as
though
he
had
already
come
among
them
.
Yet
the
Lord
God
saw
that
his
people
were
a'stiffnecked
people
,
and
he
appointed
unto
them
a
law
,
even
the
law
of
Moses
.
And
many
signs
,
and
wonders
,
and
types
,
and
shadows
shewed
he
unto
them
,
concerning
his
coming
;
and
also
holy
prophets
spake
unto
them
concerning
his
coming
:
and
yet
they
hardened
their
hearts
,
and
understood
not
that
the
law
of
Moses
availeth
nothing
,
except
it
were
through
the
atonement
of
his
blood
;
and
even
if
it
were
possible
that
little
children
eould
sin
,
they
could
not
be
saved
;
but
I
say
unto
you
,
they
are
blessed
;
for
behold
,
asin
Adam
,
or
b
nature
they
fall
,
even
so
the
blood
of
Christ
atoneth
for
their
sins
.
And
moreover
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
there
shall
be
no
other
name
given
,
nor
any
other
wey
nor
means
whereby
salvation
can
come
unto
.
the
children
of
men
,
only
in
and
through
the
name
of
Christ
,
the
Lord
Onmipotent
.
For
behold
,
he
judgeth
,
and
his
judgment
is
just
,
and
the
infant
perisheth
not
,
that
dieth
in
his
infancy
;
but
men
drink
damnation
to
their
own
souls
,
except
they
humble
themselves
,
and
become
as
little
children
,
and
believe
that
salvation
was
,
and
is
,
and
is
to
come
,
in
and
through
[File:170]
the
atoning
blood
of
Christ
,
the
Lord
Omnipotent
:
for
the
natural
man
is
an
enemy
to
God
,
and
has
been
,
from
the
fall
of
Adam
,
and
will
be
,
forever
and
ever
;
but
if
he
.
yields
to
the
enticings
of
the
Holy
Spirit
,
and
putteth
off
the
natural
man
,
and
becometh
a
saint
,
through
the
atonement
of
Christ
,
the
Lord
,
and
becometh
as
a
child
,
submissive
,
meek
,,
humble
,
patient
,
full
of
love
,
willing
to
submit
to
all
things
which
the
Lord
seeth
fit
to
inflict
upon
him
,
even
as
a
child
doth
submit
to
his
father
.
And
moreover
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
the
time
shall
come
,
when
the
knowledge
of
a
Savior
shall
spread
throughout
every
nation
,
kindred
,
tongue
,
and
people
.
And
behold
,
when
that
time
cometh
,
none
shall
be
found
blameless
before
God
,
except
it
be
little
children
,
only
through
repentance
and
faith
-
on
the
name
of
the
Lord
God
Omnipotent
;
and
even
at
this
time
,
when
thou
shalt
have
taught
thy
people
the
things
which
the
Lord
thy
God
hath
commanded
thee
,
even
then
are
they
found
no
more
blameless
in
the
sight
of
God
,
only
according
to
the
words
which
I
have
spoken
unto
thee
.
And
now
,
I
have
spoken
the
words
which
the
Lord
God
hath
commanded
me
.
And
thus
saith
the
Lard
:
They
shall
stand
asa
bright
testimony
against
this
people
,
at
the
judgment
day
;
whereof
,
they
sha
!
l
be
judged
,
every
man
,
according
to
his
works
,
whether
they
be
good
,
or
whether
they
be
evil
;
and
if
they
be
evil
,
they
are
consigned
to
an
awful
view
of
their
own
guilt
and
abominations
,
which
doth
cause
them
to
shrink
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
,
into
a
state
of
misery
and
endless
torment
,
from
whence
they
can
no
more
return
;
therefore
,
they
have
drunk
damnation
to
their
own
souls
.
Therefore
,
they
have
drunk
out
of
the
cup
.
of
the
wrath
of
God
,
which
justice
could
no
more
deny
unto
them
,
than
it
could
deny
that
Adam
should
fall
,
because
of
his
partaking
of
the
forbidden
fruit
;
therefore
,
mercy
could
have
.
claim
on
them
no
more
forever
.
And
their
torment
is
asa
lake
of
fireand
brimstone
,
whose
flames
are
unquenchable
,
and
whose
smoke
ascendeth
up
forever
and
ever
..
Thus
hath
the
Lord
commanded
me
.
Amen

CHAPTER
Il
.
Anp
-
now
,
it
came
to
pass
that
when
king
Benjamin
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
the
words
which
had
been
delivered
unto
him
by
the
angel
of
the
Lord
,
that
he
cast
his
eyes
round
about
on
the
multitude
,
and
behold
they
had
fallen
to
the
earth
,
for
the
fear
of
the
Lord
had
come
upon
them
;
and
they
had
viewed
themselves
in
their
own
carnal
state
,
even
less
than
the
dust
of
the
earth
,
And
they
all
cried
aloud
with
one
voice
,
saying
,
O
have
mercy
,
and
apply
the
atoning
blood
of
Christ
,
that
we
may
receive
forgiveness
of
our
sins
,
and
our
hearts
may
be
purified
:
for
we
believe
in
Jesus
Christ
,
the
Son
of
God
,
who
created
heaven
and
earth
,
and
all
things
,
who
shall
come
down
among
the
children
of
men
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
spoken
these
words
,
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
came
upon
them
,
and
they
were
filled
with
joy
,
having
received
a
re
-,
mission
of
their
sins
,
and
haying
peace
of
conscience
,
because
of
the
exceeding
faith
which
they
had
in
Jesus
Christ
who
should
come
,
according
to
the
words
which
king
Benjamin
had
spoken
unto
them
.
And
king
Benjamin
again
opened
his
mouth
,
and
began
to
speak
unto
them
,
saying
,
my
friends
and
my
brethren
,
my
kindred
and
my
people
,
I
would
again
call
your
attention
,
that
ye
may
hear
and
understand
the
remainder
of
my
words
which
I
shall
speak
unto
you
:
for
behold
,
if
the
knowledge
of
the
goodness
of
God
at
this
time
,
has
awakened
you
to
a
sense
of
your
nothingness
,
and
your
worthless
and
fallen
state
;
I
say
unto
you
,
if
ye
have
come
toa
knowledge
of
the
goodness
of
God
,
and
his
matchless
power
,
and
his
wisdom
,
and
his
patience
,
and
his
long
suffering
towards
the
children
of
men
,
and
also
,
the
atonement
which
has
been
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
,
that
thereby
salvation
might
come
to
him
that
should
put
his
trust
in
the
Lord
,
and
should
be
diligent
in
keeping
his
commandments
,
and
continue
in
the
faith
even
unio
the
end
of
his
life
;
I
mean
the
life
of
the
mortal
body
;
I
say
,
that
this
is
the
man
that
receiveth
salvation
,
through
the
atonement
which
was
prepared
from
the
.
foundation
of
the
world
,
for
all
mankind
,
which
ever
were
ever
since
the
fall
of
Adam
,
or
who
are
:
or
who
ever
shall
-
be
,,
even
unto
the
end
.
of
the
world
;
and
this
is
the
means
whereby
salvationcometh
.
.
And
there
is
none
other
salvation
,
save
this'which
hath
[File:172]
been
spoken
of
;
neither
is
there
any
conditions
whereby
man
can
be
saved
,
except
the
conditions
which
have
told
you
.
Believe
in
God
;
believe
that
he
is
,
and
that
he
created
all
things
,
both
in
heaven
and
in
earth
;
believe
that
he
has
all
wisdom
,
and
all
power
,
both
in
heaven
and
in
earth
;
believe
that
man
doth
not
comprehend
all
the
things
which
the
Lord
can
comprehend
.
And
again
:
Believe
that
ye
must
repent
of
your
sins
and
forsake
them
,
and
humble
yourselves
before
God
;
and
ask
in
sincerity
of
heart
that
he
would
forgive
you
:
and
now
,
if
you
believe
all
these
things
see
that
ye
do
them
.
And
again
I
say
unto
you
as
I
have
said
before
,
that
as
ye
have
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
glory
of
God
,
or
if
ye
have
known
of
his
goodness
,
and
have
tasted
of
h
:
s
love
,
and
have
received
a
remission
of
your
sins
,
which
causeth
such
exceeding
great
joy
in
your
souls
,
eyen
so
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
,
and
always
re
,
tain
in
remembrance
,
the
greatness
of
God
,
and
your
own
nothingness
,
and
his
goodness
and
long
suffering
towards
yon
unworthy
creatures
,
and
humble
yourselves
even
in
the
depths
of
humility
,
calling
on
the
name
of
the
Lord
daily
,
and
standing
steadfastly
in
the
faith
of
that
which
is
to
come
,
which
was
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
the
angel
;
and
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
if
ye
do
this
,
ye
shall
always
rejoice
,
and
be
filled
with
the
love
of
God
,
and
always
retain
a
remission
of
your
sins
;
and
ye
shall
grow
in
the
knowledge
of
the
glory
of
him
that
created
you
,
or
in
the
knowledge
of
that
which
is
just
and
true
.
And
ye
will
not
have
a
mind
to
injure
one
another
,
but
to
ive
peaceably
,
and
to
render
to
every
man
according
to
that
which
is
his
due
.
And
ye
will
not
suffer
your
children
,
that
they
go
hungry
,
or
naked
;.
neither
will
ye
suffer
that
they
transgress
the
laws
.
of
God
,
and
fight
and
quarrel
one
with
another
,
and
serve
the
devil
,
who
is
the
master
:
of
sin
,
or
who
is
the
evil
spirit
which
hath
been
spoken
of
by
our
fathers
;
he
being
an
enemy
to
all
righteousness
;
but
ye
will
teach
them
to
walk
in
the
ways
of
truth
and
soberness
;
ye
will
teach
them
to
love
one
another
,
and
to
serve
one
another
;
and
also
,
ye
yourselves
will
succor
those
that
stand
in
need
of
your
succor
;
ye
will
administer
of
your
substance
unto
him
that
standeth
in
need
;
and
ye
will
not
suffer
that
the
beggar
putteth
up
his
petition
to
you
in'
vain
,
and
turn
him
out
to
perish
.
Perhaps
thou
shalt
say
;
the
man
hes
brought
upon
him
[File:173]
self
his
misery
,
therefore
,
I
will
stay
my
hand
,
and
will
not
give
unto
him
of
my
food
,
nor
impart
unto
him
of
my
substance
,
thathe
may
not
suffer
,
for
his
punishments
are
just
.
But'l
say
unto
you
,
O
man
,
whosoever
doeth
this
,
the
same
hath
great
cause
to
repent
;
and
except
he
repenteth
of
that
which
he
hath
done
,
he
perisheth
forever
,
and
hath
no
interest
in
the
kingdom
of
God
.
For
behold
,
are
we
not
all
beggars
?
Do
we
not
all
depend
upon
the
same
being
,
even
God
,
for
all
the
substance
which
we
have
;
for
both
.
food
,
and
raiment
,
and
for
gold
,
and
for
silver
,
and
for
all
the
riches
which
we
have
of
every
kind
?
And
behold
,
even
at
this
time
,
ye
have
been
calling
on
his
name
,
and
begging
for
a
remission
of
your
sins
.
And
has
he
suffered
that
ye
have
begged
in
vain
?.
Nay
;
he
has
poured
out
his
spirit
upon
you
,
and
has
caused
that
your
hearts
should
be
filled
with
joy
,
and
has
caused
that
your
mouths
should
be
stopped
,
that
ye
could
not
find
utterance
,
so
exceeding
great
was
your
joy
.
And
now
,
if
God
,
who
has
created
you
,
on
whom
you
are
dependant
for
your
lives
,
and
for
all
that
ye
have
and
are
,
doth
grant
unto
you
whatsoever
ye
ask
that
is
right
,
in
faith
,
believing
that
ge
shall
receive
,
O
then
,
how
had
ye
ought
to
impayf
.
of
the
substance
that
ye
have
,
one
to
another
?
And
if
ye
judge
the
man
who
putteth
up
his
petition
to'
you
for
your
substance
,
that
he
perish
not
,
and
condemn
him
,
how
much
more
just
will
be
your
condemnation
,
for
withholding
your
substance
,
which
doth
not
belong
to
you
,
but
to
God
,
to
whom
also
,
your
life
belongeth
;
and
yet
ye
put
up
no
petition
,
nor
repent
of
the
thing
which
thou
hast
done
.
I
say
unto
you
,
wo
be
unto
that
man
,
for
hig
substance
shall
perish
with
him
;
and
now
,
I
say
these
things
unto
those
who
are
rich
,
as
-
pertaining
lo
the
things
of
this
world
.
And
again
,
I
say
unte
the
poor
,
ye
that
have
not
and
yet
have
sufficient
,
that
ye
remain
from
day
today
;
I
mean
all
you
that
deny
the
beggar
,
because
ye
have
not
;
I
would
that
ye
say
in
your
hearts
,
that
I
give
not
because
I
have
not
;
but
if
I
had
,
I
would
give
,
And
now
,
if
ye
say
this
in
your
hearts
,
ye
remain
guiltless
,
otherwise
ye
are
condemned
,
and
your
condemnation
is
just
:
for
ye
covet
that
which
ye
have
not
received
.
And
now
,
for
the
sake
of
these
things
which
I
have
spoken
unto
you
;
that
is
,
for
the
sake
of
retaing
.
a
remission
of
your
sins
from
day
:
to
day
,
that
ye
may
[File:174]
walk
guiltless
before
God
,
I
would
that
ye
should
impart
of
your
substance
to
the
poor
,
every
man
accord
:
ing
to
that
which
he
hath
,
such
as
feedig
the
hungry
,
clothing
the
naked
,
visiting
the
sick
,
and
administering
to
their
relief
,
both
spiritually
and
temporally
,
according
to
their
wants
,
and
see
that
all
these
things
are
done
in
wisdo
:
n
and
order
:
for
it
is
not
requisite
that
a
man
should
run
faster
than
he
has
strength
..
And
again
:
It
is
expedient
that
he
should
be
diligent
,
that
thereby
he
might
win
the
prize
;
therefore
,
all
things
must
be
done
in
order
.
And
:
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
,
that
whosoever
among
you
that
borroweth
of
his
neighbor
,
should
return
the
thing
that
he
borroweth
,
according
as
he
doth
agree
,
or
else
thou
shalt
commit
sin
,
and
perhaps
thou
shalt
cause
thy
neighbor
to
commit
sin
also
.
And
finally
,
I
can
.
not
tell
you
all
the
things
whereby
ye
may
commit
sin
:
for
there
are
divers
ways
and
means
,
even'so
many
,
that
I
cannot
number
them
.
But
this
much
I
can
tell
you
,
that
if
ye
do
not
watch
yourselves
,
and
your
thoughts
,
and
your
words
,
and
your
deeds
,
and
observe
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
continue
in
the
faith
ofwhat
ye
have
heard
concerning
the
coming
of
our
Lomi
,
even
unto
the
end
of
your
lives
,
ye
must
perish
,
nd
now
,
O
man
,
remember
,
and
perish
not
.
CHAPTER
HL
Anp
now
,
it
came
to
pass
that
when
king
Benjamin
had
thus
spoken
to
his
people
,
he
sent
among
them
,
desiring
to
know
of
his
people
,
if
they
believed
the
words
which
he
had
spoken
unto
them
.
And
they
all
cried
with
one
voice
,
saying
,
Yea
,
we
believe
all
the
words
which
thou
hast
spoken
unto
us
;
and
also
,
we
know
of
their
surety
and
truth
,
because
of
the
Spirit
of
the
Lord
Omnipotent
,
which
has
wrought
a
mighty
change
in
us
,
or
in
our
hearts
,
that
we
have
no
more
disposition
to
do
evil
,
but
todo
good
continually
..
And
we
,
ourselves
,
also
,
through
the
infinite
goodness
:
of
God
,
and
the
manifestations
of
his
Spirit
,
have
great
views
of
that
which
is
to
come
;
and
were
it
expedient
,
we
could'
prophesy
of
all
things
.
And
itis
the
faith
which
we
hays
had
on
the
things
which
our
[File:175]
king
has
spoken
unto
us
,
and
hag
brought
us
to
this
great
knowledge
,
whereby
we
do
rejoice
with
such
exceeding
great
joy
:
and
we
are
willing
to
enter
into
a
covenant
with
our
God
,
to
do
his
will
,
and
to
be
obedient
to
his
commandments
in
all
things
that
he
shall
command
us
,
all
the
remainder
of
our
days
,
that
we
may
not
bring
upon
ourselves
a
never
ending
torment
,
as
has
been
spoken
by
the
angel
,
that
we
may
not
drink
out
of
the
cup
of
the
wrath
of
God
,
And
now
,
these
are
the
words
which
king
Benjamin
desired
of
them
;
and
therefore
he
said
unto
them
,
Ye
have
sjoken
the
words
that
I
desired
;
and
the
covenant
which
ye
have
made
,
isa
righteous
covenant
.
And
now
,
because
of
the
covenant
which
ye
have
made
,
ye
shall
be
called
the
children
of
Christ
,
his
sons
,
and
his
daughters
:
for
behold
,
this
day
he
hath
spiritually
begotten
you
;
for
ye
say
that
your
hearts
are
changed
through
faith
on
his
name
;
therefore
,
ye
are
born
of
him
,
and
have
become
his
sons
and
his
daughters
,
And
under
this
head
,
ye
are
made
free
;
and
there
is
no
other
head
whereby
ye
can
be
made
free
.
here
is
no
other
name
given
,
whereby
salvation
cometh
;
therefore
,
I
would
that
ye
should
take
upon
you
the
name
of
Christ
,
all
.
you
that
have
entered
into
the
covenant
with
God
,
that
ye
should
be
obedient
unto
the
end
of
your
lives
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
doeth
this
,
shall
be
found
at
the
right
hand
of
God
,
for
he
shall
know
the
name
by
which
he
is
called
:
for
he
shall
be
called
by
the
name
of
Christ
.
And
now
,
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
shall
not
take
upon
them
the
name
of
Christ
,
must
be
called
by
some
other
name
;
therefore
,
he
findeth
himself
on
the
left
hand
of
God
.
And
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
also
,
that
this
is
the
name
that
I
said
I
should
give
unto
you
,
that
never
should
be
blotted
out
,
except
it
be
through
transgression
;
therefore
,
take
heed
that
ye
do
not
transgress
,
that
the
name
be
not
blotted
out
of
your
hearts
.
I
say
unto
you
,
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
to
retain
the
name
written
always
in
your
hearts
,
that
ye
are
not
found
on
the
left
hand
of
God
,
but
that
ye
hear
and
know
the
voice
by
which
ye
shall
be
called
,
and
also
,
the
name
by
which
he
shall
call
you
:
for
,
how
knoweth
a
man
the
master
whom
he
has
not
served
,
and
who
is
a
stranger
unto
him
,
and
is
far
from
the
thoughts
and
intents
of
his
heart
?
And
again
:
Doth
a
man
take
[File:176]
an
ass
which
belongeth
to
his
neighbor
,
and
keep
himt
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
;
he
will
not
even
suffer
that
he
shall
feed
among
his
flocks
,
but
will
drive
him
away
,
and
cast
him
out
.
I
say
unto
you
,
that
even
so
shall
it
be
among
you
,
if
ye
.
know
not
the
name
by
which
ye
are
called
.
Therefore
,
1
would
that
ye
should
be
steadfast
and
immovable
,
always
abounding
in
good
works
,
that
Christ
,
the
Lord
God
Omnipotent
,
may
seal
you
his
,
that
you
may
be
brought
to
heaven
,
that
yemay
have
everlasting
salvation
and
eternal
life
,
through
the
wisuom
,
and
power
,
.
and
justice
,
and
mercy
of
him
,
who
created
all
things
,
in
heaven
and
in
earth
,
who
is
God
above
all
.
Amen
.
CHAPTER
iV
.
Anp
now
,
king
Benjamin
thought
it
was
expedient
,
after
having
finished
speaking
to
the
people
,
that
he
should
take
the
names
of
all
those
who
had
entered
into
a
covenant
with
God
,
to
keep
his
commandments
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
not
one
soul
,
except
it
were
little
children
,
but
what
bad
entered
into
the
covenant
,
and
had
taken
upon
them
the
name

Christ
.
And
again
:
It
came
to
pass
that
when
king
Benjamin
had
made
an
end
of
all
these
things
,
and
had
consecrated
his
son
Mosiah
,
to
be
a
ruler
and
a
king
over
his
people
,
and
had
given
him
all
the
charges
concerning
the
kingdom
,
and
also
had
appointed
priests
to
teach
the
people
,
that
thereby
they
might
hear
and
know
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
to
stir
them
up
in
remembrance
of
the
oath
which
they
had
made
,
he
dismissed
the
multitude
,
and
they
returned
,
every
one
according
to
their
families
,
to
their
own
houses
.
And
Mosiah
began
to
reign
in
his
father's
stead
.
And
he
began
to
reign
in
the
thirtieth
year
of
his
age
,
making
in
the
whole
,
about
four
hundred
and
seventysix
years
from
the
time
that
Lehi
left
Jerusalem
.
And
king
Benjamin
lived
three
years
,
and
he
died
.
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
king
.
Mosiah
did
walk
in
the
ways
of
the
Lord
,
and
did
--
observe
.
his
.
judgments
,
and
.
his
statutes
,
and
did
keep
his
commandments
in
all
things
whatsoever
he
commanded
him
.
eae
[File:177]
And
king
Mosiah
did
cause
his
people
that
they
should
till
the
earth
.
And
healso
,
himself
did
till
the
earth
,
that
thereby
he
might
not
become
burthensome
to
his
people
,
that
he
might
do
according
to
that
which
his
father
had
done
,
in
all
things
.
And
there
was
no
contention
among
all
his
people
,
for
the
space
of
three
years
.
,
CHAPTER
Â¥
.
Axp
now
,
it
came
to
pass
that
afler
king
Mosiah
had
had
continual
peace
,
for
the
space
of
three
years
,
he
was
desirous
to
know
concerning
the
people
who
went
up
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
Lehi
-
Nephi
,
or
in
the
city
of
Lehi
-
Nephi
:
for
his
people
had
heard
nothing
from
them
,
from
the
time
they
left
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
therefore
,
they
wearied
him
with
their
teasings
.
and
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Mosiah
granted
that
sixteen
of
their
strong
men
might
go
up
to
the
land
of
Lehi
-
Nephi
,
to
inquire
concerning
their
brethren
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
,
they
started
to
go
up
,
having
with
them
one
Ammon
,
he
being
a
strong
and
mighty
man
,
and
a
descendant
of
Zarahemla
;
and
he
was
also
their
leader
.
And
now
,
they
knew
not
the
course
they
should
travel
in
the
wilder
.
ness
,
to
go
up
to
the
land
of
Lehi
-
Nephi
;
therefore
,
they
wandered
many
days
in
the
wilderness
,
eve
forty
days
did
they
wander
.
And
when
they
had
wardered
forty
days
,
they
came
toa
hill
,
which
is
north
of
the
land
of
Shilom
,
and
there
they
pitched
their
tents
.
And
Ammon
took
three
of
his
brethren
,
and
their
names
were
Amaleki
,
Helem
,
and
Hem
,
and
they
went
down
into
the
land
of
Nephi
;
and
behold
,
they
met
the
king
of
the
people
,
who
was
in
the
land
of
Nephi
,
and
in
the
land
of
Shilom
;
and
they
were
surrounded
by
the
king's
guard
,
and
were
taken
,
and
were
bound
,
and
were
committed
to
prison
.
And
it
came
to
pass
when
they
had
been
in
prison
two
days
,
they
were
again
brought
before
the
king
,
and
their
bands
were
loosed
;
and
they
stood
before
the
king
,
and
were
permitted
,
or
rather
:
commanded
that
oe
should
answer
the
questions
which
he
should
as
.
[File:178]
them
.
And
he
said
unto
them
,
behold
,
Iam
Limhi
,
the
son
of
Noah
,
who
was
the
son
of
Zeniff
,
who
came
up
out
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
to
inherit
this
land
,
which
was
the
land
of
their
fathers
,
who
was
made
a
king
by
the
voice
of
the
people
.
And
now
,
I
desire
to
know
the
cause
whereby
ye
were
so
bold
as
to
come
near
the
walls
of
the
city
,
when
I
,
myself
,
was
with
my
guards
,
without
the
gate
?
And
now
,
for
this
cause
have
suffered
that
ye
should
be
preserved
,
that
[
might
inquire
of
you
,
or
else
I
should
have
caused
that
my
guards
should
have
put
you
to
death
.
Ye
are
permitted
to
speak
.
And
now
,
when
Ammon
saw
that
he
was
permitted
to
speak
,
he
went
forth
and
bowed
himself
before
the
king
;
and
rising
again
he
said
,
O
King
,
I
am
very
thankful
before
God
this
day
,
that
1
am
yet
alive
,
and
am
permitted
to
speak
;
and
I
will
endeavor
to
speak
with
boldness
:
for
I
am
assured
that
if
ye
had
known
me
,
ye
would
not
have
suffered
that
1
should
have
wore
these
bands
.
For
I
am
Ammon
,
and
am
a
descendant
of
Zarahemla
,
and
have
come
up
out
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
to
inquire
concerning
our
breth
.
ren
,
whom
Zeniff
brought
up
out
of
that
land
.
And
now
,
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Limhi
had
heard
the
words
of
Ammon
,
he
was
exceeding
glad
,
and
said
,
now
,
I
know
of
a
surety
that
my
brethren
who
were
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
are
yet
alive
..
And
now
,
I
will
rejoice
;
and
on
the
morrow
,
I
will
cause
that
my
people
shall
rejoice
also
.
For
behold
,
we
are
in
bondage
to
the
Lamanites
,
and
are
taxed
with
a
tax
which
is
grievous
to
be
borne
.
And
now
,
behold
,
our
brethren
will
deliver
us
out
of
our
bondage
,
or
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
we
will
be
their
slaves
:
for
itis
better
that
we
be
slaves
to
the
Nephites
,
than
to
pay
tribute
to
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
.
:
And
now
,
king
Limhi
commanded
his
guards
that
they
should
no
more
bind
Ammon
,
nor
his
brethren
,
but
caused
that
they
should
go
to
the
bill
which
was
north
of
Shilom
,
and
bring
their
brethren
into
the
city
,
that
thereby
they
might
eat
,
and
drink
,
and
rest
themselves
from
the
labors
of
their
journey
;
for
they
had
suffered
many
things
:
they
had
suffered
hunger
,
thirst
,
and
fatigue
.
And
now
,
it
came
to
pass'on
the
morrow
,
that
,
king
Limhi
sent
a
proclamation
among
-
all
his
people
,
that
thereby
they
might
.
gather
themselves
together
to
the
[File:179]
temple
,
to
hear
the
words
which
he
should
speak
untothem
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
gathered
themselves
together
,
that
he
spake
unto
them
in
this
wise
,
saying
,
O
ye
,
my
people
,
lift
up
your
heads
and
be
comforted
:
for
behold
,
the
time
is
at
hand
,
or
is
not
far
distant
,
when
we
shall
no
longer
be
in
subjection
to
our
enemies
,
notwithstanding
our
many
stragglings
,
which
have
been
in
vain
;
yet
I
trust
there
remaineth
an
effectual
struggle
to
be
made
.
Therefore
,
lift
up
your
heads
,
and
rejoice
,
and
put
your
trust
in
God
,
in
that
God
who
was
the
God
of
Abraham
,
and
Isaac
,
and
Jacob
;
and
also
,
that
God
who
brought
the
children
of
Israel
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
,
and
caused
that
they
should
walk
through
the
Red
Sea
on
dry
ground
,
and
.
fed
them
with
manna
,
that
they
might
not
perish
in
the
wilderness
;
and
many
more
things
did
he
do
for
them
.
And
again
:
That
same
God
has
brought
our
fathers
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
and
has
kept
and
preserved
his
peopel
,
even
until
now
.
And
behold
,
it
is
because
of
our
iniquities
and
abominations
,
that
has
brought
us
into
bondage
.
And
ye
all
are
witnesses
this
day
,
that
Zeniff
,
who
was
made
king
over
this
people
,
he
being
overzealous
to
inherit
the
land
of
his
fathers
,
therefore
being
deceived
by
the
cunning
and
craftiness
of
king
Laman
,
who
having
entered
into
a
treaty
with
king
Zeniff
,
and
having
yielded
up
into
his
hands
the
possessions
of
a
part
of
the
land
,
or
even
the
city
of
LehiNephi
,
and
the
city
of
Shilom
;
and
the
land
round
about
;
and
all
this
he
did
,
for
the
sole
purpose
of
bringing
this
people
into
subjection
,
or
into
bondage
.
And
behold
,
we
at
this
time
do
pay
tribute
to
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
,
to
the
amount
of
one
half
of
our
corn
,
and
our
barley
,
and
even
all
our
grain
of
every
kind
,
and
one
half
of
the
inerease
of
our
flocks
,
and
our
herds
;
and
even
one
half
of
all
we
have
or
possess
,
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
doth
exact
of
us
,
or
our
lives
.
And
now
,
is
not
this
grieyous
to
be
borne
?
And
is
not
this
,
our
affliction
great
?
Now
behold
,
how
great
reason
have
we
to
mourn
.
Yea
,
I
say
unto
you
,
great
are
the
reasons
which
we
have
to
mourn
:
for
behold
,
how
many
of
our
brethren
have
been
slain
,
and
their
blood
has
been
spilt
.
in
vain
,
and
all
because
of
iniquity
:
For
if
this
people
had
not
fallen
into
transgression
,
the
Lord
would
not
have
suffered
that
this
great
evil
should
come
upon
them
.
But
behold
,
they
would
.
not
hearken
unto
hig
words
;
but
there
&
[File:180]
arose
contentions
among
them
,
even
so
much
that
they
did
shed
blood
among
themselves
.
And
a
prophet
of
the
Lord
have
they
slain
;
yea
,
chosen
man
of
God
,
who
told
them
of
their
wickedness
and
abominations
,
and
prophesied
of
many
things
which
are
to
come
,
yea
,
even
the
coming
of
Christ
.
And
because
he
said
unto
them
,
that
Christ
was
the
God
,
the
Fa
.
ther
of
all
things
,
and
said
that
he
should
take
upon
him
the
image
of
man
,
and
it
should
be
the
image
af
.
ter
which
man
was
created
to
the
beginning
;
or
in
other
words
,
he
said
that
man
was
created
after
the
image
of
God
,
and
that
God
should
come
down
among
the
children
of
men
,
aud
take
upon
him
flesh
and
blood
,
and
go
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
;
and
now
,
because
ne
said
this
,
they
did
put
him
to
death
;
and
many
more
things
did
they
do
,
which
brought
down
the
wrath
of
God
uponthem
.
Therefore
,
who
wondereth
that
they
are
in
bondage
,
and
that
they
are
smitten
with
sore
afflictions
!
For
behold
,
the
Lord
has
said
,
I
will
not
succor
my
people
in
the
day
of
their
transgression
;
but
1
will
hedge
up
their
ways
,
that
they
prosper
not
;
and
their
doings
shall
be
asa
stumbling
block
before
them
.
And
again
,
he
saith
,
if
my
people
shall
sow
filthiness
,
they
shall
reap
the
chaff
thereof
,
in
the
whirlwind
;
and
the
effects
thereof
,
is
:
poison
.
And
again
,
he
saith
,
if
my
people
shall
sow
filthiness
,
they
shall
reap
the
east
wind
,
which
bringeth
immediate
destruction
,
And
now
,
behold
,
the
promise
of
the
Lord
is
fulfilled
;
and
ye
are
smitten
,
and
afflicted
.
But
if
ye
will
turn
to
the
Lord
with
full
purpose
of
heart
,
and
put
your
trust
in
him
,
and
serve
him
with
all
diligence
of
mind
:
if
ye
do
this
,
he
will
,
according
to
his
own
will
and
pleasure
,
deliver
you
out
of
bondage
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
king
Limhi
had
made
.
an
end
of
speaking
to
his
people
,
for
-
he
spake
many
things
unto
them
,
and
oaly
a
few
of
them
have
i
written
in
this
book
,
he
told
his
people
all
the
things
concerning
their
brethren
who
were
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;:
and
he
caused
that
Ammon
should
stand
up
before
the
multitude
,
and
rehearse
unto
them
all
that
had
happened
unto
their
brethren
,
from
the
time
that
Zeniff
went
up
out
of
the
land
,
even
until
the
time
that
he
himself
came
up
out
of
the
land
.
And
he
also
rehearsed
unto
them
the
last
words
which
king
Benjamin
had
taught
them
,
and
explained
them
to
the
people
ofking
Limhi
,
so
that
they
might
understand
all
[File:181]
the
words
which
he
spake
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
he
had
done
alk
this
,
that
king
Limhi
dismissed
the
multitude
,
and
caused
that
they
should
return
,
every
one
unto
his
own
house
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
caused
that
the
plates
which
contained
the
record
of
his
people
,
from
the
time
that
they
deft
the
land
of
Zaralttemla
,
should
be
brought
before
Ammon
,
that
he
might
read
them
..
Now
,
as
soonas
Ammon
had
read
the
record
,
the
king
inquired
of
him
to
know
if
-
he
could
interpret
languages
.
And
Ammon
told
him
that
he
could
not
..
And
the
king
said
unte
him
,
being
grieved
for
the
af
ilictions
of
my
people
,
I
caused
that
forty
and
three
of
my
people
should
take
a
journey
into
the
wilderness
,
that
thereby
they
might
find
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
that
we
might
appeal
unto
our
brethren
to
deliver
us
out
of
bondage
;
and
they
.
were
lost
in
the
wilderness
,
for
the
space
of
many
days
,
yet
they
were
diligent
,
and
found
not
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
but
returned
to
this
land
,
having
traveled
in
a
land
among
many
waters
;
having
discovered
a
land
which
was
covered
with
bones
of
men
,
and
of
beasts
,
&c
.,
and
was
also
covered
with
ruins
of
buildings
of
every
kind
:
having
discovered
a
land
which
had
been
peopled
with
a
people
who
were
as
numerous
as
the
hosts
of
Israel
.
_
.
And
for
a
testimony
that
the
things
that
they
-
have
said
are
true
,
they
have
breught
twenty
four
plates
,
which
are
filled
with
engravings
;
and
they
are
of
pure
gold
.
And
behol
!,
also
,
they
have
brought
breastplates
,
which
are
large
;.
and
they
are
of
brass
,
and
of
copper
,
and
are
perfectly
sound
.
And
again
,
they
have
brought
swords
,
the
hilts
thereof
have
perished
,
and
the
blades
thereof
were
cankered
with
rust
;
and
there
is
no
one
in
the
land
that
is
able
to
interpret
:
the
language
or
the
engravings
that
are
on
the
plates
..
Therefore
,
[
said
unto
thee
,
canst
thou
translate
?.
And
I
say
unto
thee
again
,
knowest
thou
of
any
one
that
can
translate
?
for
lam
desirous
that
these
records
should
be
translated
into
our
language
.
For
,
perhaps
they
will
give
us
a
knowledge
of'a
remnant
of
the
people
who
have
been
destroyed
,
from
whence
these
records
came
;
or
,
perhaps
they
will
give
usa
knowledge
of
this
very
people
who
have
been
destroyed
;
and
am
desirous
to
know
the
cause
of
their
destruction
.
Now
Ammon
said
unto
him
,
I
can
asssuredly
tell
thee
,
O
king
,
of
a
man
that
can
translate
the
records
:
[File:182]
for
he
has
wherewith
that
he
can
look
,
and
translate
all
records
that
are
of
ancient
date
:
and
itis
a
gift
from
God
.
And
the
things
are
called
interpreters
;
and
no
man
can
look
in
them
,
except
he
be
command
.
ed
,
lest
he
should
look
for
that
he
ought
not
,
and
he
should
perish
.
And
whosoever
is
commanded
to
look
in
them
,
the
same
is
called
seer
.
And
behold
,
the
king
of
the
people
who
is
in
the
Jand
of
Zarahemla
,
is
the
man
that
is
commanded
to
do
these
things
,
and
who
has
this
high
gift
from
God
.
And
the
king
said
,
that
a
seer
is
greater
than
a
prophet
.
And
Ammon
said
,
that
aseer
is
a
revelator
,
and
a
prophet
also
;
and
a
gift
which
is
greater
,
can
no
man
have
,
except
he
should
possess
the
power
of
God
,
which
no
man
can
;
yet
a
man
may
have
great
power
given
him
from
God
.
But
a
seer
can
know
of
things
which
have
past
,
and
also
of
things
which
are
to'come
;
and
by
them
shall
all
things
be
revealed
,
or
rather
,
shall
secret
things
be
made
manifest
,
and
hidden
things
shall
come
to
light
,
and
things
which
are
not
known
,
shall
be
made
known
by
them
;
and
also
,
things
shall
be
made
known
by
them
,
which
otherwise
could
not
be
known
.
Thus
God
has
provided
a
means
that
man
,
through
faith
,
might
work
mighty
miracles
:
therefore
,
he
becometh
a
great
benefit
to
his
fellow
beings
.
And
now
,
when
Ammon
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
these
words
,
the
king
rejoiced
exceedingly
,
and
gave
thands
to
God
,
saying
,
doubtless
,
a
great
mystery
is
contained
within
these
plates
;
and
these
interpreters
were
doubtless
prepared
for
the
purpose
of
unfolding
all
such
mysteries
to
the
children
of
men
,
O
how
marvelous
are
the
works
of
the
Lord
,
and
how
long
doth
he
suffer
with
his
people
;
yea
,
and
how
blind
and
impenetrable
are
the
understandings
of
the
children
of
men
:
for
they
will
not
seck
wisdom
,
neither
do
they
desire
that
sheshould
rule
over
them
.
Yea
,
they
are
as
a
wild
flock
,
which
fleeth
from
the
shepherd
,
and
scattereth
,
and
are
driven
,
and
are
devoured
by
the
beasts
of
the
forest
.

.
THE
RECORD
OF
ZENIFF
.
An
account
of
his
people
,
from
the
time
they
left
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
until
the
time
that
they
were
delivered
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
.
Â©
I
,
Zentey
,
having
been
taught
in
all
the
language
of
the
Nephites
,
and
having
had
a
knowledge
of
the
land
of
Nephi
,
or
of
the
Jand
of
our
fathers'
first
inheritanee
,
and
having
been
sent
as
a
spy
ainong
the
Las
manites
,
that
might
spy
out
their
forces
,
that
onr
army
might'
come
upon
them
and
destroy
them
;
but
when
T
saw
that
which
was
good
among
them
,
Iowas
desirous
that
they
should
not
be
destroyed
:
therefore
,
Fcontended
with
my
brethren
in
the
wilderness
:
for
I
would
that
our
ruler
should
make
a
treaty
with
them
.
But
he
being
an
austere
and
a
blood
-
thirsty
man
,
commanded
that
I
should
be
slain
;
but
I
Was
.
rescued
by
the
shedding
of
much
blood
:
for
father
fought
against
father
,
and
brother
against
brother
,
until
the
greatest
number
of
our
army
was
destroyed
in
the
wilderness
;
and
we
returned
,
those
of
us
that
were
spared
,
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
to
relate
that
tale
to
their
wives
,
and
their
children
.
~
And
yet
,
Â§
bemg
over
zealous
to
inherit
the
land
of
our
fathers
,
colleeted
as
many
as
were
desirous
to'go
up
to
possess
the
land
;
and
started
again'
onour
journey
into
the
wilderness
,
to
go
up
to
the
land
;
but
we
were
smitten
with
famine
and
sore
afflictions
:
for
we
were
slow
to
remembcr
the
Lord
our
God
.
Nevertheless
,
after
many
days'
wandering
in
the
wilderness
,
we
pitched
our
tents
in
the
place
where
our
brethren
were
slain
,
which
was
near
to
the
land
of
our
fathers
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
[
went
again
with
four
of
my
men
,
into
the
city
,
in
unto
the
king
,
that
1
might
know
of
the
disposition
of
the
king
,
and
that
I
might
know
if
I
might
go
in
with
my
people
,
and
possess
the
land
in
peace
.
And
I
went
in
unto'the
king
,
and
he
covenanted
with
me
,
that
I
might
possess
the
land
of
Lehi
-
Nephi
,
and
the
land
of
Shilom
.
And
he
also
commanded
that
his
people
should
depart
ott
of
the'
land
,:
and
[
and
my
people
wentinto
the
land
,
that
we
might
possess
it
,
And
we
began
to
build
buildings
,
and
to
repair
the
walls
of
the
city
,
yea
,
even
the
walls
[File:184]
of
the
city
of
Lehi
-
Nephi
,
and
the
city
of
Shilom
..
And
we
began
to
till
the
ground
,
yea
,
even
with
all
manner
of
seeds
,
with
seeds
of
corn
,
and
of
wheat
,
and
of
barley
,
and
with
neas
,
and
with
sheum
,
and
with
seeds
of
all
manner
of
fruits
:
and
we
did
begin
to
multiply
and
prosper
in
the
land
,
Now
,
it
was
the
cunning
and
the
craftiness
of
king
Laman
,
to
bring
my
people
into
bondage
,
that
he
yielded
up
the
land
,
that
we
might
possess
it
.
Therefore
,
it
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
dwelt
in
the
land
for
the
space
of
twelve
years
,
that
king
Laman
began
to
grow
uneasy
,
lest
by
any
means
my
people
should
wax
strong
in
,
the
land
,
and
that
,
the
could
not
overpower
them
and
bring
them
into
bondage
.
Now
,
they
were
a
lazy
,
and
an
idolatrous
people
;
therefore
,
they
were
desirous
to
bring
us
into
eae
,
that
.
they
.
might
glut
themselves
with
the
labors
of
our
hands
;
yea
,
that
they
might
feast
themselves
upon
the
flocks
of
our
fields
,
Therefore
,
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Laman
began
to
stir
up
his
people
,
that
they
should
contend
with
my
people
;
therefore
,
there
began
to
he
wars
dnd
contentions
.
in
the
land
.
For
,
in
the
thirteenth
year
of
my
reign
in
the
land
of
Nephi
,
away
on
the
south
of
the
land
of
Shilom
,
when
my
people
were
wateringand
feeding
their
flocks
,
and
tilling
their
lands
,
a
numerous
host
of
Lamanites
came
upon
them
,
and
began
to
slay
them
,
and
to
take
off
their
flocks
,
and
the
cornof
thgir
fields
.
Yea
,
and
it
cdme
to
pass
that
they
fled
,
all
that
were
not
overtaken
,
even
into
the
city
of
Nephi
,
and
did
call
upon
me
for
protection
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
arm
.
them
with
bows
,
and
with
arrows
,
with
swords
,
and
with
cimeters
,
and
with
clubs
,
and
with
slings
,
and
with
all
majner
of
weapons
which
we
could
invent
,
and
I
and
my
people
did
go
forth
against
the
Lamanites
,
to
battle
:
yea
,
in
the
strength
of
the
Lord
did
we
go
forth
to
battle
against
the
Lamanites
:
for
I
and
my
people
.
did
.
cry
:
mightily
to
the
Lord
,
that
he
would
deliver
us
out
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies
,
for
we
were
awakened
to
.
remembrance
of
the
deliverance
of
our
fathers
,.
-
And
God
did
hear
our
cries
,
and
did
answer
our
prayers
:
and
we
did
go
fourth
in
his
might
..
Yea
,
we
did
go
.
forth
.
against
the
.
Lamanites
;
and
in
one
day
ands
night
,
we
did
slay
three
thousand
and
forty
three
;
we
did
slay
them
,
even
until
we
had
driven
:
them
out
.
of
our
land
.
And
I
,
myself
;
with
mine
own
hands
,
did
[File:185]
help
to
bury
theirdead
.
And
behold
,
to
our
great
sorrow
and
lamentation
,
two
hundred
and
seventy
nine
of
our
brethren
were
slain
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
again
began
to
establish
the
kingdom
;
and
we
gain
began
to
possess
the
land
in
peace
.
And
I
caused
that
there
should
be
weapons
of
war
made
,
of
every
kind
,
that
thereby
I
might
have
weapons
for
my
people
,
against
the
time
the
Lamanites
should
come
up
again
to
war
against
my
people
,
And
I
set
guards
round
about
the
land
,
that
the
Lamanites
might
not
come
opon
usagain
unawares
,
and
destroy
us
;
and
thusI
did
guard
my
people
,
and
my
fiocks
,
and
keep
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
our
enemies
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
inherit
the
land
of
our
fathers
,
for
many
years
;
yea
,
for
the
space
of
twenty
and
two
years
.
And
I
did
cause
that
the
men
should
till
the
ground
,
and
:
raise
all
manner
of
grain
,
and
all
manner
of
fruit
,
of
every
kind
.
And
I
did
cause
that
the
women''should
spin
,
and
toil
and
work
,
and
work
all
manner
of
fine
linen
;
yea
,
and
.
cloth
of
every
kind
,
that
we
might
.
clothe
our
nakedness
;
and
thus
we
did
prosper
in
the
land
;
thus
we
did
have
continual
peace
in
the
land
,
for
the
space
of
twenty
and
two
years
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Laman
died
,
and
his
son
began
to
reign
in
his
stead
.
And
he
began
to
stir
his
people
up
in
rebellion
against
my
people
;
therefore
,
they
began
to
prepare
for
war
,
and
to
come
up
to
battle
against
my
people
.
But
I
had
sent
my
spies
out
round
about
the
land
of
Shemlon
,
that
I
might
discoyer
their
preparations
,
that
I
might
guard
against
them
,
that
they
might
not
come
upon
my
people
and
destroy
them
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
up
upon
the
north
ofthe
land
of
Shilom
,
with
their
numerous
hosts
,
men
armed
with
bows
,
and
with
arrows
,
and
with
swords
,
and
with
cimeters
,
and
with
stones
,
and
with
slings
;
and
they
had
their
heads
shaved
,
that
they
were
naked
;
and
they
were
girded
with
a
leathern
girdle
about
their
loins
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
caused
that
the
women
and
children
of
my
people
should'be
hid
in
the
:
wilderness
;
and
T
also
caused
that
all
my
old
men
that
could
bear
arms
,
andalso
all
my
young
men
that
were
able
.
to
bear
arms
,
should
gather
themselves
together
,
to
go
[File:186]
@
to
battle
against
the
Lamanites
;
and
-
Idid
place
them
in
,
their
ranks
,
every
man
-.
according
:
to
his
.
age
.
....:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
go
up
to
battle
against
the
Lamanites
.
And
I
,
even
I
,
in
my
old
age
,
did
go
up
to
battle
against
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
go
up
in
the
strength
of
the
Lord
,
to
battle
.
:
Now
,
the
Lamanites
knew
.
nothing
concerning
the
Lord
,
nor
the
strength
of
the
Lord
;
therefore
,
they
depended
upon
their
own
strength
.
Yet
they
werea
strong
people
,
as
to
the
strength
of
men
:
they
werea
wild
,
and
ferocious
,
and
a
blood
-
thirsty
people
,
belieying
in
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
,
which
is
.
this
:.
Believing
that
they
were
driven
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
because
of
the
iniquities
of
their
.
fathers
,
and
that
they
were
wronged
in
the
wilderness
by
their
brethren
;
and
they
were
also
wronged
,
while
crossing
the
sea
.
Andagain
:
That
they
were
wronged
while
in
the
land
of
their
firet
inheritance
,
after
they
had
crossed
the
sea
;
and
all
this
,
because
that
Nephi
wag
more
faithfui
in
.
keeping
the
.
commandments
of
the
Lord
;
therefore
he
was
favored
of
the
Lord
,
for
the
Lord
heard
his
prayers
and
answered
.
them
,
and
he
took
the
lead
of
their
journey
in
the
wilderness
.
And
his
brethren
were
wroth
with
him
,
because
they
understood
not
the
dealings
of
the
Lord
;
they
were
also
wroth
with
him
upon
the
waters
,
because
they
hardened
their
hearts
againstthe
Lord
.
And
again
:
They
were
wroth
with
him
when
they
had
arriven
to
the
promised
land
,
because
they
said
that
he
had
taken
the
ruling
ofthe
people
out
of
their
hands
;
and
the
sought
to
kill
him
.
And
again
:
.
They
were
wro
with
him
,
because
he
departed
into
the
wilderness
as
the
Lord
had
commanded
him
,
and
took
the
reeords
which
were
engraven
on
the
plates
of
brass
;
for
-
they
said
that
he
robbed
them
.
And
thus
they
have
taught
their
children
,
that
they
should
hate
them
,
and
that
they
should
murder
them
,
and
that
they
should
:.
rob
and
plunder
them
,.
and
.
do
all
they
could
to
destroy
them
;
therefore
,
they
have
an
eternal
hatred
towards
the
children
of
Nephi
.
For
this
very
cause
has
king
Laman
,
by
his
cunning
and
lying
craftiness
,
and_his
fair
promises
,
deceived
me
,
that
I
have
.
brought
this
,
my
people
,
up
into
this
land
,
that
they
may
.
destroy
-
them
;
yea
,
and
we
have
suffered
.
this
many
years
in
the
Jand
.
[File:187]
And
now
I
,
Zeniff
,
after
having
told
all
these
things
unto
my
.
people
concerning
the
Lamanites
,
'I
did
stimulate
them
to
go
to
battle
with
their
might
,
puttin
their
trust
in
the
Lord
;
therefore
;
we
did
.
conten
with
them
,
face
to
face
..
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
drive
them
again
out
,
of
our
land
;
and
we
slew
them
:-
with
a
great
slaughter
,
even
.
so
many
that
we
did
not
number
them
.
ot
And
it
eame
to
pags
that
we
returned
again
to
.
our
own
land
,
and
my
people
again
-
began
to
tend
their
flocks
,
and
to
till
their
ground
.
And
now
,
I
being
.
old
,
did
confer
the
kingdom
upon
one

CHAPTER
VII
.
Axp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Zeniff
conferred
the
kingdom
upon
Noah
,
one
of
his
sons
;.
therefore
Noah
began
to
reign'in
his
stead
;
and
he
did
not
walk
in
the
ways
of
his
father
.
For
behold
,
he
did
not
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
but
he
did
walk
after
the
desires
of
hisown
heart
...
And
he
had
many
wives
and
concubines
.
And
he
did
cause
his
people
to
commit
sin
,
anddo
that
which
was
abominable
in
the
sight
ef
the
Lord
.
Yea
,
and
they
did
commit
whoredoms
,
and
all
-
manner
of
wickedness
.
.
And
he
laid
a
tax
of
one
fifth
part
of
all
they
:
possessed
;
a
fifth
part
of
their
gold
and
of
their
silver
,
and
a
fifth
part
of
their
ziff
,
and
.
of
:
their
copper
,
and
of
their
brass
and
their
iron
;
and
a
fifth
part
of
their
fatlings
;
and
also
,
a
fifth
part
ofall
their
grain
.
And
all
this
did
he
take
,
to
support
himself
,
and
.
his
wives
,
and
his
concubines
,
and
also
,
his
priests
,
and
their
wives
,
and
their
concubines
;
thus
he
had
changed
the
:
affairs
of
the
kingdom
.
For
he
put
down
.
all
the
priests
that
.
had
been
consecrated
b
Is
father
,
and
consecrated
new
ones
in
their
stead
,
such
as
were
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
hearts
..
Yea
,
and
thus
they
were
supported
in
their
laziness
,
and
in
their
idolatry
,
and
in
their
-
whoredoms
,
by
.
the
taxes
which
king
.
Noah
had
put
upon
his
people
;
thus
did
the
:
people
labor
exenedinglyy
.
to
support
iniquity
.
Yea
,.
and
.
they
.
also
,
became
.
,
idolatrous
,.
because
they
[File:188]
ENR
owen
were
deceived
by
the
vain
and
flattering
words
of
the
king
and
priests
:
for
they
did
speak
flattering
things
unto
them
,
'
i
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Noah
built
many
-
elegant
and
-
spacious
buildings
;
and
he
ornamented
them
with
fine
work
of
wood
,
and
of
all
manner
of
precious
things
,
of
gold
,
and
of
silver
,
and
of
iron
,
and
of
brasa
,
and
of
ziff
,
and
of
copper
;
and
he
also
built
-
him
aspa
cious
palace
,
and
a
throne
in
the
midst'thereof
,
-
all'
of
which
was
of
fine
wood
,
and
was
ornamented
with
gold
,
and
silver
,
and
with
precious
things
..
And
he
also
caused
that
his
workmen
should
work
all
manner
of
fine
work
within
the
walls
of
the
temple
,
of
fine
wood
,
and
of
copper
,
and
of
brass
;
and
the
seats
which
weie
set
apart
for
the
high
priests
,
which
were
above
all
the
other
seats
,
he
did
ornament
with
pure
gold
;
and
he
caused
a
breastwork
to
be
built
before
them
,
that
they
might
rest
their
bodies
and
their
arms
upon
,
while
they
should
speak
lying
and
vain
:
words
to
his
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
built
a
tower
near
the
temple
;
yea
,
a
very
high
tower
,
ever'
so
high
that
he
could
stand
upon
the
top
thereof
and
overlook
the
land
of
Shilom
,
and
also
the
land
of
Shemlon
,
which
was
possessed
by
.
the
Lamanites
;
and
he
could
even
look
over
all
the
land
round
about
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
lie
caused
many
buildings
to
be
built
in
the
land
Shilom
;
and
he
caused
a
great
tower
to
be
built
on
the
hill
north
of
the
land
Shilom
,
which
bad
been
a
resort
for
the
children
of
Nephi
,
at
the
time
they
fled
out
of
the
land
;
and
thus
he
did
do
with
the'riches
which
he
obtained
by
the
taxation
of
his
people
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
hie
placed
his
heart
upon
his
riches
,
and
he
spent
his
time
in
riotous
living
with
his
wives
and
his
concubines
;
and
so
did
also
his
priests
spend
their
time
with
harlots
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
planted
vineyards
round
abdut
in
the
land
;
and
he
built
wine
presses
,
and
made
wine
in
abundance
;
and
therefore
lie
became'a
wine
bibber
,
and
also
,
his'
people
.
'
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites'
began
to
come
in
upon
his
people
,
upon
small
numbers
,
and
to
slay
them
in
their
fields
,
and
while
they
were
tending
their
flocks
.
And
king
Noah
sent
guards
round
about
the
land
to
keep
them
off
:
but
hedid
not
send
a
sufficient
number
,
and
the
Lamanites
came
upon
them
and
[File:189]
killed
them
,.
and
drove
many
of
their
flocks
out
of
the
land
:
thus
the
Lamanites
began
to
destroy
them
,
and
to
.
exercise
their
hatred
upon
them
.
!
And
it
came
-
to
pass
that
king
Noah
sent
his
armies
against
them
,
and
they
were
driven
back
,
or
they
drove
them
back
for
a
time
;
therefore
,
they
returned
rejoicing
in
their
spoil
.
And
now
,
because
of
-
thig
reat
victory
,
they
were
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
easter
they
did
boast
in
.
their
own
strength
,
saying
,
that
their
fifty
could
stand
against
thousands
of
the
Lamanites
;
and
thus
they
did
boast
,
and
did
delight
in
blood
,
and
the
shedding
of
the
blood
of
their
brethren
,
and
this
because
of
the
wickedness
of
their
king
and
priests
.
'
;
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
a
man
amon
;
them
,
whose
name
was
Abinadi
;
and
he
-
went
for'
among
them
,
and
began
to
prophesy
,
saying
,
behold
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
,
and
thus
hath
he
commanded
me
,
saying
,
Go
forth
and
say
unto
this
people
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
:
wo
be
unto
this
people
,
for
I
have
seen
their
abominations
,
and
their
wickedness
,
and
their
whoredoms
;
and
except
they
repent
,
I
.
will
visit
them
.
.
in
mine
anger
.
And
except
they
repent
,
and
turn
to
the
Lord
their
God
,
behold
,
I
will
deliver
them
.
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
:
yea
,
and
they
shall
be
brought
into
bondage
;
and
they
shall
be
afflicted
by
.
the
.
hand
of
their
enemies
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
they
shall
know
.
that
Iam
the
Lord
their
God
,
andama
jealous
God
,
visiting
the
mmiquities
of
my
.
people
..
And
it
shall
-
come
to
pass
that
except
this
people
repent
,
and
turn
unto
the
Lord
their
-
God
,
they
.
shall
be
brought
irito
bondage
;
and
-
none
shall'deliver
them
,
except
it
be
the
Lord
the
Almighty
God
.
Yea
,
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
they
shall
cry
unto
me
,
I
will
be
slow
to
hear'
their
cries
;
yea
,
and
I
will
suffer
them
that
they
be
smitten
by
their
enemies
...
And
except
they
repent
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
,
and
cry
mightily
to
the
Lord
their
God
,
I
will
not
hear
their
prayers
,
neither
will
I
deliver
them
out
of
their
afflictions
;
and
thus
saith
the
Lord
,
and
thus
hath
he
-
commanded
me
.
Now
itcame
.
to
pass
that
when
.
Abinadi
had
spoken
these
.
words
unto
them
,
they
were
wroth
with
-
him
,
and
sought
to
,
take
-
away
his'
life
;.
but
the
Lord
deliyered
him
out
of
:
their
hands
.
Now
when
king
Noah
had
heard
of
the
words
:
which
:
Abinadi
had
:
epoken
:
untothe
people
,
he
was
also
:
wroth
;.
and
:
he
said
,
who
is
[File:190]
Abinadi
,
that
I
and
my
people
should
be
judged
of
him
?
or
whois
the
Lord
,
that
shall
.
bring
upon'
my
people
such
great
affliction
?
-
I
command
you
tobrin
Abinadi
hither
,
that
I
:
may
:
slay
him
:
for
-
he
has
sai
these
things
,
that
he
might
stir
up
.
my
people
to
anger
,
one
with
another
,
and'to
raise
contentions
among
my
people
;
therefore
,
I
will
slay
him
.
Now
the
eyes
-
of
the
people
were
blinded
;
therefore
,
they
hardened
their
hearts
against
the
words
of
Abinadi
,
and
:
they
sought
from
that
time
forward
to
take
him
.
-
And
king
Noah
hardened
-
his
heart
against
the
word
of
the
Lord
;
and
he
did
not
repent
of
his
evil
doings
.
And
it
came
-
to
pass
that
after
the
space
of
two
years
,
that
Abinadi
came
among
them
in
disguise
,
that
they
knew
him
not
,
and
began
te
prophesy
among
them
,
saying
,
thus
:
has
the
Lord
commanded
me
,
saying
:
Abinadi
,
go
.
and
prophesy
unto
this
my
-
people
,
for
they
have
hardened
their
hearts
against
my
words
;
they
have
repented
not
of
their
evil
doings
;
therefore
,
I
will
visit
them
in
my
anger
,
yea
,
in
my
fierce
anger
will
I
visit
them
in
their
iniquities
and
abominations
;
yea
,
wo
be
unto
this
generation
.
And
the
Lord
said
untome
,
stretch
forth
thy
hand
,
and
prophesy
,
saying
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
:
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
this
:
generation
,
because
of
their
iniquities
,
shall
be
brought
into
bondage
,
and
shall
be
smitten
on
the
cheek
:
yea
,
and
shall
be
driven
by
men
,
and
shall
be
slainy
and
the
vultures
of
the
air
,
and
the
dogs
,
yea
,
and
the
wild
beasts
,
shall
devour
their
flesh
,
>

S
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
the
life
of
king
Noah
shall
be
valued
even
as
a
garment
ina
hot
furnace
;
for
he
shall
know
that
I
am
-
the
Lord
.
and
?
it
-
shall
come
to
pass
that
Iwill
smite
this
my
people
with
sore
afilictions
;
yea
,
with
famine
and
with
pestilence
;
and
I'
will
cause
that
they
shall
how]
all
the
day
-
long
.
Yea
,
and
I
will
cause
that
they
shall
,
have
burdens
lashed
upon
their
backs
;
and
they
shall
be
driven
before
;
like
a
dumb
ass
.
;
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
I
will
send
forth
hail
among
them
,
'
and
it
shall
smite
them
;
and
they
shall
also
be
smitten
with
the
east
wind
:
and
insects
shall
pester
their
.
land
also
,
and
devour
their
grain
.
And
they
shall
be
smitten
witha'
great
pestilence
:
and
all
this
will
J
do
,
because'of
their
iniquities'and
abomina
ions
,
wah
bie
And
it
-
shall
-
come
:
to'
pass
that
except
they
repent
,
Iwill
utterly
destroy
-
them
from
off
the
face
of
the
earths
:
[File:191]
yet
they
shall
Jeave'a
record
behind
them
,
and
I
will
preserve
them
for
other
nations
which
shall
possess
the
land
;
yea
,
even
this
will
Ido
,
that
I
may
discover
the
abominations
of
this
people
to
other
nations
.
And
may
things
did
Abinadi
prophesy
against
this
!
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
thatthey
were
angry
with
him
;
and
they
took
him
and
carried
him
bound
before
the
king
,
andsaid
unto
the
king
,
behold
,
we
have
brought
a
man
before
thee
who
has
prophesied
evil
concerning
thy
people
,
and
saith
that
God
will
destroy
them
;
and
he
also
prophesieth
evil
concerning
thy
lite
,
and
saith
that
thy
life
shall
be
as
.
a
garment
-
in
a
furnace
of
fire
.
And
again
,
he
saith
that
thou
shalt
be
as
a
.
stalk
,
even
aga
dry
stalk
of
the
field
,
'
which
is
ran
over
by
.
the
beasts
and
trodden
under
foot
.
And
again
,
he
saith
thou
shalt
be
as
the
blossoms
of
a
thistle
,
which
when
itis
fully
ripe
,
if
the
wind
bloweth
,
it
is
driven
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
land
;
and
he
pretendeth
the
Lord
hath
spoken
it
.
And
he
saith
all
this
shall
:
come
upon
thee
,
except
thou
repent
;
and
this
because
of
thine
iniquities
.
And
now
,
O
king
,
what
great
evil
hast
thou
done
,
or
what
great
sins
have
thy
people
committed
,
that
we
should
be
condemned
of
God
or
judged
of
this
man
?.
And
now
,
O
king
,
behold
,
we
are
guiltless
,
and
thou
,
O
king
,
hast
not
sinned
;
therefore
,
this
man
has
lied
concerning
you
,
and
he
has
:
prophesied
in
vain
.
And
behold
,
we
are
strong
,
we
shall
not
.
come
into
bondage
,
or
be
taken
captive
by
our
eriemies
;
yea
,
and
thou
hast
prospered
in
the
land
,
and
thou
shalt
also
prosper
.
Behold
,
here
is
the
man
,
we
deliver
him
into
thy
hands
;
thou
mayest
do
with
him
as
seemeth
thee
good

And
it
came
.
to
pass
that
king
Noah
caused
:
that
Abinadi
should
be
cast
into
prison
;
and
he
command
.
ed
that
-
the
priests
should
gather
themselves
together
,
that
he
might
hold
a
council
with
them
what
heshould
do
with
him
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
said
unto
the
king
,
bring
him
hither
,
that
we
may
question
him
:
And
the
king
:
commanded
that
he
should
be
brought
before
them
.
..
And
they~
-
began
to
question
him
,
that
they
might
cross
him
,
that
thereby
they
might
have
wherewith
to

accnse

him
;
but
:-
he
answered
them
boldly
,
and
withstood
:
all
their
questions
,
yea
,
'
to'their
astonishment
:
for
hedid
.
withstand
:
them
in
[File:192]
all
.
questions
,
and
did
confound
them
in
all
-
their
words
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
one
of
them
said
:
unto
him
,
what
meaneth
the
words
which
are
written
,
and
which
have
been
taught
by
our
fathers
,
saying
:
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
him
that
bringeth
good
tidings
;
that
publisheth
peace
;
that
bringeth
good
tidings
of
good
;
that
publisheth
salvation
;.
that
saith
unto
Zion
,
thy
God
reigneth
;
thy
watchmen
shall
lift
up
the
voice
;
with
the
voice
together
shall
they
sing
,
for
they
shall
see
eye
to
eye
,
when
the
Lord
shall
bring
again
Zion
.
Break
forth
into
joy
;
sing
together
fye
waste
places
-
of
Jerusalem
:
for
the
Lord
hath
comforted
his
people
:
he
hath
redeemed
Jerusalem
.
The
Lord
hath
made
bare
his
holy
arm
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
nations
;
and
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
shall
see
the
salvation
of
our
God
.
And
now
Abinadi
said
unto
them
,
are
you
priests
,
and
pretend
to
teach
this
people
,
and
to
understand
the
spirit
,
of
prophesying
,
and
yet
desire
to
know
of
me
what
these
things
mzan
?
I
say
unto
you
,
wo
be
unto
you
for
perverting
the
ways
of
the
Lord
.
For
if
ye
understand
these
things
,
ye
have
not
taught
them
;
therefore
,
ye
have
perverted
the
ways
of
the
Lord
.
Ye
have
not
upplied
your
hearts
to
understanding
;
therefore
,
ye
have
not
been
wise
.
Therefore
,
what
teach
ye
this
people
?.
And
they
said
,
we
teach
the
law
of
Moses
.
And
again
,
he
said
unto
them
,
if
ye
teach
the
law
of
Moses
,
why
do
ye
not
keep
it
?
Why
do
ye
set
your
Hearts
upon
riches
?
Why
do
ye
commit
whoredoms
,.
and
spend
your
strength
with
harlots
,
yea
,
and
cause
this
people
to
commit
sin
,
that
the
Lord
has
cause
to
send
me
to
prophesy
against
this
people
,
yea
,.
even
a
great
evil
against
this
people
?
Know
ye
not
that
I
speak
the
truth
?
Yea
,
yeknow
that
I
speak
the
truth
;
and
you
ought
to
tremble
before
God
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
ye
.
shall
be
smitten
for
your
iniquities
:
for
ye
have
said
:
that
ye
teach
the
law
of
Meses
.
And
what
know
ye
concerning
.
the
law
of
Moses
?)
Doth
salvation
come
-
by
the
law
of
Moses
?
Whatsay
ye
?
And
they
answered
and
said
,
that
salvation
did
come
by
the
Jaw
of
Moses
...
But
now
Abinadi
said
unto
them
,
I
-
know
if
ye
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
yeshall
be
saved
;:-
yea
,
if
ye
Keep
the
commandments
which
the
Lord
delivered
unto
Moses
:
in
the
mount
of
Sinai
,
saying
:
I
-
am
the
Lord
thy
God
,
who
has
brought
thee
ont
of
the
land
of
[File:193]
Egypt
,
out
ofthe
louse
of
bondage
.
Thoushalt

no

.
Thou
shalt
not

thee
any

image
,
or
any

of
any
thing
in

,
or
things
whichare
in

earth
:
beneath
.;
Now
Abinadi
saidunto
them
,
have
ye
done
all
this
?
-
Isay
:
unto
you
,
nay
,
ye
have
:-
not

And
have
ye

this
people
that
they
should
do
albthese
things
?
~
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
,
ye
have
not
.
And
now
when
the
king
had
-
heard
these
words
,
he
said
unto
his
priests
;
away~
with

him
:
for
what
have
we
to
do
with
:
him
,
for
he
is
mad
.
And
they
stood
forth
and
attempted
to
lay
their
hands
on
him
:
but
he
.
withstood
them
,
and
said
unto
them
,
touch
me
not
,
for'God
shall
smite
youaf
ye
lay
your
hands
upon
me
,
for
I
have
not
delivered
the
message
which
the
Lord
sent
me
to
deliver
;
neither
have
:
I
told
you
that
which
ye
requested
that
I
shoud
telly
.
therefore
,
God
will
not
suffer
that
I
shall
be
destroyed
at
this
time
.
ButI
must
fulfil
the
commandments
wherewith
God
has
:
commanded
me
,
and
because
I
have
:
told
you
the
truth
,
ye
are
angry
with
me
.
Andagain
,
because
Ihave
spoken
the
word
of
God
,
ye
have
judged
me
that
I
am
mad
.
tes
Now
it
:
came
to
pass
after
Abinadi
had
spoken
these
words
,
that
the
people
of
king
Noah
.
durst
not
lay
their
hands
on
him
;
:
for'the
:
Spirit
-
of
the
Lord
was
.
upon
him
;
and
his
face
shone
with
exceeding
lustre
,
even
as
Moses'
did
while
in
the
mount
of
Sinai
,
while
speaking
with
the
Lord
.
a
he
spake
with
power
and
authority
from
God
;
and
he
continued
his
words
,
saying
,
ye
see
that
ye
have
not

to
slay
me
,
theretore
I

Yea
,
and
I
perceive
that
it
cuts
you
to

,
because
I
tell
you
the
.
truth
concerning
your
iniquities
;
yea
,
and
my
words
fill
you
with
wonder
and
amazement

with

I

CHAPTER
VIII
.
Anp
it
:
came
to
pass
that
after
Abinadi
had
madean
end
of
these
sayings
,
that
he
said
-
unto
them
,.
have
ye
taught
this
people
that
.
they
should
observe
to
do
all
these
things
?
for
to
keep
these
commandments
?
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
;
for
if
ye
had
,
the
Lord
would
not
have
caused
me
to
come
forth
and
to
prophesy
evil
concerning
this
people
.
And
:
now
ye
have
said
that
salvation
cometh
by
the
law
of
Moses
.
I
say
urito
you
that
it
is
expedient
that
ye
should
keep
the
law
of
Moses
-
as
yet
;
but
I
.
say
.
unto
you
;
that
:
the
time
shall
)
come
when
it
shall
no
more
be
expedient
to
keep
-
the
law
of
Moses
.
.
And
moreover
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
salvation
doth
not
.
come
be
:
ee
law
alone
;:
and
:
were
it
not
for
the
atonement
which
God
himself
shall
make
:
for
the
[File:195]
sins
and
iniquities
of
his
.
people
,
'that
they
must
una
voidably
perish
,
notwithstanding
the
law
of
-
Moses
..
And
riow
I
say
unto
you
,
that
it
was
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
law
given
to
the
children
of
Israel
,
yea
,
even
a
very
strict
law
;
for
they
were
a
stiffnecked
people
:
quick
to
do
iniquity
,
and'slow
.
to
remember
the
Lord
their
God
;
therefore
there
was
a
law
.
given
them
,
yea
,
a
law
of
performances
and
of
ordinances
,
a
law
which
they
were
to
observe
.
strictly
,
from
day
to
day
,
to
keep
them
in
remembrance
of
God
,
and
their
duty
towards
him
.
But
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
all
these
things
were
types
of
things
to
come
:.
And
now
,
did
they
understand
the
law
?
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
,
they
did
not
.
all
understand
the
law
;
and
this
beeause
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
:
for
they
understood
not
that
there
could
not
any
man
be
saved
,
except
it
were
through
the
redemption
of
.
God
.
For
behold
,
did
not
Moses
prophesy
unto
them
concerning
the
coming
of
the
Messiah
,
and
that
God
.
should
.
redeem
his
people
,
yea
,
and
even
all
the
prophets
:
who
have
prophesied
ever
since
the
world
began
?
Have
they
not
spoken
more
or
less
concerning
these
things
?
Have
they
not
said
-
that
Goa
hiniself
should
come
down
among
the
children
of
men
,
and
take
upon
him
.
the
form
of
man
,
and
go
forth
in
mighty
:
power
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
?
Yea
,
and
have
they
not
.
said
also
,
that
he
should
bring
to
pass
.
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
,
and
that
he
,
himself
,
should
be
oppressed
and
afflicted
?)
Yea
,
even
doth
.
not
Isaiah
say
,
who
hath
believed
our
report
,
and
:
to
whom
is
the
arm
of
the
Lord
revealed
?
for
heshall
grow
up
before
him
as
a
tender
plant
,
and
as
-
a
root
.
out
of
dry
ground
:
he
hath
no
form
nor
comeliness
;
and
when
we
shall
see
him
,
there
is
no
beauty
that
we
should
desire
him
..
He
is
despised
and
rejected
of
men
;
a
man
of
sorrows
,
and
acquainted
with
grief
:
and
we
hid
.
as
it
were
-
our
face
from
::
him
;
he
was
despised
,
and
we
esteemed
him
not
.
ooh
Surely
he
--
has
borne
our
griefs
,
and
-
carried
-
our
sor~
rows
:
yet
we
didesteem
him
stricken
,
smitten
of
God
,
and
afflicted
...
But
he
was
wounded
for
our
transgressions
,
he
was
bruised
.
forour
:
iniquities
;
the
chatise
-
\
ment
of
our
peace
was
upon
him
;
and
:
with
his
stripes
we
are
healed
.
Allwe
,
like
sheep
;
have
gone
astray
;:
we
have
turned
every
one
to
his
own
way
;
andthe
:
LordHath
laid
on'
him
the
iniquities
of
us
:
all
.:
He
was
.
oppressed
,
and'he
was
afflicted
,
yet
.
he
opened
not
:
his
:
[File:196]
Paes
en
eee
mouth
:
he
is
brought
asa
-
lamb
to
the'sliughter
;
and
as
asheep
before
her
shearers
is
dumb
,
so
he
opened
not
his
mouth
,
.
He
was
taken
-
from_
prison
and
from
judgment
:
and
who
shall
declare
his
generation
?
for
he
was
cut
off
out
.
of
the
land
of
the
living
:
for
the
transgressions
of
my
people
was
he
stricken
.
And
he
made
his
grave
with
the
.
wicked
,
and
withthe
rich
in
his
death
;
because
-
he
.
had
done
no
evil
,-
neither
was
any
deceit
in
:
his
mouth
.
Yet
it
pleased
the
.
Lord
to
bruise
:
him
:
he
hath
put
him
:
to
grief
:
when
thou
:
shalt
make
his
soul
an
offer
.
ing
for
sin
,
he
shall
see
his
seed
,
he
shall
prolong
his
days
,
and
the
pleasure
of
the
Lord
shall
-
prosper
in
his
hand
.
Heshall
see
of
the
travail
of
his
soul
,
and
shall
be
satisfied
:
by
his
knowledge
shall
my
righteous
servant
justify
many
;
for
he
shall
bear
.
their
iniquities
..
Therefore
will
I
divide
him
a
.
portion
with
.
the
great
,
and
he
shall
divide
the
spoil
with
the
strong
;
because
he
-
hath
poured
out
his
soul
unto
death
:
and
he
was
numbered
with
the
transgressors
;
and
he
bare
the
sins
of
many
,
and
made
intercession
for
the
transgressors
.
And
now
Abinadi
said
unto
.
them
,
I
would
that
ye
should
understand
that
God
himself
shall
come
down
among
the
children
of
men
,
and
-
shall
redeem
his
:
people
;
and
beeause
he
dwelleth
in
flesh
,
he
shall
be
called
the
Son
of
God
:
and
having
subjected
the
flesh
to
the
will
of
the
Father
,
being
the
Father
and
the
Sou
;
the
Father
,
because
he
was
conceived
by
the
power
of
God
;
and
the
Son
,
because
of
the
flesh
;
thus
becom
:
ing
the
Father
and
Son
:
and
they
are
-
one
God
,
yea
;
the
very
eternal
Father
-
of
heaven
and
of
earth
;
'
and
thus
.
the
flesh
becoming
subject
.
to
.
the
Spirit
,
or
the
Son
tothe
Father
,
being
one
God
,
suffereth
temptation
,
and
yieldeth
not
to
the
temptation
,
but
suffereth
himself
to
be
mocked
,
and
scourged
,
and
cast
out
,
and
disowned
by
his
people
.
And
after
all
.
this
,
after
working
many
mighty
miracles
among
the
children
of
men
.
he
shall
be
led
,
yea
,
even
as
Isaiah
said
,
as
.
a
sheep
before
the
shearer
is
dumb
,
so
he
opened
nat
his
mouth
;
yea
,
even
so
he
shall
-
be
led
,
crucified
and
slain
,
the
flesh
becoming
subject
even
unto
death
,
the
will
of
the
Son
being
swallowed
up
in
the
will
of
the
Father
;
and
thus
God
breaketh
the
bands
of
death
;
having
gained
the
victory
oyer
death
;
giving
.
the
Son
ower
to
make
intercession
for
the
children
-
of
:
men
:
ving
ascended
into
:
heaven
;
having
the
bowels
of
mercy
;
being
filled
with
compassion
toward
the

renof
men
;
standing
betwixt

justice
;
having
broken
the
bands
:
of
death
,
taken
upon
himself
their
iniquity
and
their
transgressions
;
having
redeemed
.
them
,
and
satisfied
the
demands
of
justice
.
And
now
I
say
unto
you
,
who
shall
declare
his
.
generation
?
.
Behold
,
I
say
unto'
you
,
that
when
his
soul
has
been
made
an
offering
for
sin
,
he
shall
.
see
his
seed
.
And
now
what
say
ye
?
-
And
who
shall
be
his
seed
?
Behold
I
say
unto
:
you
,
that
whosoever
has
heard
the
words
of
the
prophets
,
yea
,
all
the
holy
prophets
who
have
prophesied
concerning
the
coming
of
the
Lord
;
I
say
unto
you
,
that
all
those
who
have
hearkened
unto

haye

looked
forward
to
that
day
fora
remission
of

;
I
say
unto
you
,
that
these
are
his
seed
,
or
-
they
are
-
heirs
of
the
kingdom
of
God
:
for
these
are'they
whose

sins
he
has
borne
;
these
are
they
for'
whom
he
has
:
died
,
to
redeem
them
.
from
.
their
transgressions
.
And
now
,
are
they
not
his
seed
?.
Yea
;
and
are
not
.
the
prophets
,
every
one
that
has
opened
his'mouth
to
prophesy
,
that
has
not
fallen
into
transgression
;
I
mean
all
the
holy
prophets
ever
since
the
world
began
?
J'say
unto
you
.
that
they
.
are
his
seed
;
and
these
are'they
who
have
published
peace
,
who
have
brought
good
tidings
of
good
,
who
have
published
salvation
;
and
said
untoâ
Zion
,
thy
God
reigneth
!
And
O
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
were
their
feet
!
And'again
,
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
feet
of
those
that
are
still
publishing
peace
!-
And
again
,
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the
-
feet
of
those
who
shall
hereafter
publish
peace
,
yea
,
from
this
time
henceforth
and
forever
!
And
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
this
is
not
all
:
For
O
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
are
the'
feet
:
of
him
that
bringeth
good
tidings
,
that
is
the
founder
of
peace
;
ea
,
even
the
Lord
,
who
-
has
redeemed
his
people
;
yea
,
jim
who
hasgranted
salvation
unto
his
people
:
for
were
it
not
for
:
the
redemption
.
whichhe
hath
made
for
his'people
,
which
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
ofthe
world
;
Isay
unto
you
,
were
it
not
for
this
,
all
mankind
must
:
have
perished
.
'
But
behold
,
'
the
bands
of
death
shallbe
broken
,
andthe
Son
reigneth
,
and
hath
power
over'the
dead
;
therefore
,
he
bringeth
to'pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
.
And
there
cometh
:
a
resurrection
,
even
a
first
resurrection
;
yea
,
even
a
resurrection
of
those'
that
have
been
,
and
who
are
,
and
who'shall
be
,
even
until
the
resurrection
of
Christ
:
[File:198]
for
.
so
shall
he
be
called
.
'
-
And
now
,.
the
resurrection
of
all
the
.
prophets
,
and
all
those
that
have
believed
-
in
their
words
,
or
all
those
that
have
kept
.
the
.
commandments
of
God
,
shall
come
forth
.
im
the
.
first
-
resurrection
;
therefore
,
they
are
the
first
resurrection
,
They
are
raised
to
dwell
.
with
God
who
h&s
redeemed
them
:
thus
they
have
eternal
life
through
Christ
,.
who
.
has
broken
the
bands
of
death
.
And
these
are
those
who
have
part
in
the
first
resurrection
;
and
these
are
they
that
have
died
before
Christ
came
,
in
their
ignorance
,
not
having
salvation
declared
unto
them
.
And
thus
the
Lord
bringeth
.
about
the
restoration
of
these
;.
and
they
have
a
part
in
the
first
resurrection
,
or
have
eternal
life
,
being
redeemed
by
the
Lord
.
And
little
chil
.
dren
also
have
eternal
life
,
But
behold
,
and_fear
,
and
tremble
before
God
;
for
ye
ought
to
tremble
:
for
the
Lord
redeemeth
none
such
that
rebel
against
him
,
and
die
in
their
sins
;
yea
,
even
all
those
that
have
perished
in
their
sins
ever
since
the
world
began
,
that
have
wilfully
rebelled
against
God
,
that
.
have
known
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
would
not
keep
them
;
these
are
they
that
have
no
part
in
the
first
resurrection
.
Therefore
had
ye
not
ought
.
to
tremble
?
For
salvation
cometh
to
none
such
;
for
the
Lord
hath
redeemed
none
such
;
yea
,
neither
can
the
Lord
redeem
such
;
for
he
cannot
deny
himself}
.
for
he
.
cannet
.
deny
justice
when
it
has
its
claim
.
And
now
I
say
unto
you
,
that
the
time
shall
come
that
the
salvation
of
the
.
Lord
shall
-
be
declared
to
every
nation
,
kindred
,
tongue
,
and
people
.
Yea
,
Lord
,
thy
.
watehmen
shall
lift
up
their
voice
;
with
.
the
voice
together
shall
they
sing
:
for
they
shall
see
eye
to
eye
,
when
the
Lord
shall
.
bring
again
Zion
,.
Break
forth
into
.
joy
,
sing
together
,
ye
waste
places
of
Jerusalem
:
for
the
Lord
hath
comforted
.
his
people
,.
he
hath
redeemed
,
Jerusalem
.
..
The
.
Lord
hath
made
bare
his
holy
arm
.
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
nations
:
and
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
shal
!
see
the
salvation
of
our
God
.
.
,
And
now
it
came
to
.
pass
thatafter
Abinadi
had
.
spoken
these
words
,
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
.
xaid
,
the
time
shall
-
come
when
.
all
shall
see
the
galvation
of
the
Lord
;
when
every
nation
,
kindred
,
tongue
and
people
,
shall
see
eye
to
eye
,
and
.
shall
confess
before
God
that
his
.
judgments
are
just
;
and
then
.
shall
.
the
wicked
be
cast
out
,
and
they
shall
have
cause
to
howl
,
and
.
weep
,
and
.
wail
,.
and
gnash
,
their
teeth
;
.
and
.
this
beeause
they
would
not
-
bearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
[File:199]
Lord
;
therefore
the
Lord
redeemeth
.
them
not
,
for
they
are
carnal
and
devlish
,
and
the
devil
has
power
over
them
;
yea
,
even
that
old
serpent
that
did
beguile
our
first
parents
,
which
was
the
cause
of
their
fall
;
which
was
the
cause
ofall
mankind
becoming
carnal
,
sensual
,
devlish
,
knowing
evil
from
good
,
subjecting
themselves
to
the
devil
.
Thus
all
mankind
were
lost
;
and
behold
,
they
would
have
been
endlessly
lost
,
were
it
not
that
God
redeemed
his
people
from
their
lost
and
fallen
state
.
But
remember
,
that
he
that
persists
in
his
own
carnal
nature
,
and
goes
on
in
the
.
ways
.
of
sin
-
and'rebellion
against
God
,
remaineth
.
in
his
fallen
state
,
and
the
devil
,
hath
all
power
over
him
.
.
Therefore
he
is
as
though
there
was
no
redemption
made
;
being
an
enemy
to
God
;
and
also
isthe
devil
an
enemy
to
God
..
And
now
-
if
Christ
had
net
come
into

the
world
,
speaking
of
things
.
te
come
,
as
though
they

had
already
come
,
there
could
:
have
been

no

...
And
if
Christ
had
not
,
risen
,
from
the
dead
,
or
have
broken
the
bands
of

,
that
the

therefore

Even

they

Therefore

CHAPTER
IX
.
Axp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Abinadi
had
finished
these
sayings
,
that
the
king
commanded
that
the
priests
should
take
him
and
cause
that
he
should
be
put
todeath
.
But
there
was
one
among
them
,
whose
name
was
Alma
,
he
also
being
a
descendant
of
Nephi
.
And
he
was
a
young
man
,
and
he
believed
the
words
which
Abinadi
had
spoken
,
for
he
knew
concerning
the
iniquity
which
Abinadi
had
testified
against
them
:
Therefore
he
began
to
plead
with
the
king
that
he
would
not
be
angry
with
Abinadi
,
but
suffer
that
he
might
depart
in
peace
.
But
the
king
was
more
wroth
,
and
caused
that
Alma
should
be
cast
out
from
among
them
,
and
sent
his
seryants
after
him
,
that
they
might
slay
him
.
Bathe
fled
from
before
them
,
and
hid
himself
,
that
they
found
him
not
.
And
he
,
being
concealed
for
many
days
;
did
write
all
-
the
words
which
Abinadi
had
spoken
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
caused
that
his
guards
should
surround
Abinadi
,
and
take
him
;
and
they
bound
him
and
cast
him
into
prison
.
And
after
three
days
,
having
counselled
with
his
priests
,
he
caused
that
he
should
again
be
brought
before
him
.
And
hesaid
unto
him
,
Abinadi
,
we
have
found
an
aecusalion
against
thee
,
and
thou
art
worthy
of
death
.
-
For
thou
.
has
said
that
God
himself
should
come
down
among
-
the
children
of
men
;
and
now
for
this
cause
thou
shaltbe
put
to
death
,
unless
thou
wilt
recall
all
the
words
which
thou
hast
spoken
evil
:
concerning
me
and
my
people
.
Now
Abinadi
said
unto
him
:
I
say
unto
you
,
I
will
not
recall
the
words
which
I
have
spoken
unto
you
concerning
this
people
,
for
they
are
true
;
and
that
ye
may
know
of
their
surety
,
I
have
saffered
myself
that
I
have
fallen
into
your
hands
.
Â©
Yea
,
and'
I
will
suffer
even
until
death
,
and
I
-
will
not
recall
my
:
words
,
and
they
shall
stand
asa
testinonyagainstyou
.
And
if
[File:201]
ye'slay
me
,
ye
will'shed
innocent
blood
,
and
this
shall
.
also
stand
as
a
testimony
against
you
at
the
last
day
.
And
now
king
Noah
way
about'
to
release
him
,
for
he
feared
his
word
;
for
he
feared
that
-
the
judgments
of
God
would
come
upon
him
,
But
the
priests
lifted
up
their
voices
-
against
him
,
and
began
to
accuse
him
,
saying
:
He
-
has
reviled
the
king
.
Therefore
the
king
was
stirred
up
in
anger
against
him
,
and
he
delivered
him
up
,
that
he
might
be
slain
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
him
,
and
scourged
-
his
:
skin
with
faggots
,
yea
,
even
unto
death
.
And
now
-
when
the
flames
began
to
scorch
him
,
he
cried
unto
:
them
saying
:
Behol
,
even
as
yehave
done
-
unto
me
,
so
shallit
come
to
.
pass
that
thy
seed
shall
cause
:
that
many
-
shall
suffer
,
even
the
pains
of
death
,
by
fire
;
and
this
:.
because
they
believe
in
the
salvation
of
the
Lord
their
'God
..
And
it
will
-
come
to
passthat
ye
shall
be
afflicted
with
all
manner
of
diseases
,
because
of
our
iniquities
.
Yea
and
ye
shall
be
smitten
on
every
and
,
and
shall
be
driven
and
scattered
to
and
.
fro
;
even
aga
wild
flock
is
driven
by
wild
and
ferocious
beasts
.
And
in
that
day
ye
shall
-
be
hunted
,
and
ye
shallbe
taken
by
the
hand
of
your
enemies
,
and
then
ye
shall
suffer
,
as
I
suffer
,
the
pains
of
death
by
fire
.
Thus
God
executeth
vengeance
upon
those
that
destroy
his
people
.
O
God
,
receive
my
soul
.
And
now
when
Abinadi
had
said
these
words
,
he
fell
,
having
suffered
death
by
fire
;
yea
,
having
been
put
to
death
-
because
he
would
not
deny
the
commandments
of
God
:
having
sealedthe
truth
of
his
words
by
his
-
death
.
te
And
:
now
that
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
,
who
had
fied
from
the
servants
-
of
king
Noah
,
repented
of
his
sins
and
iniquities
,
and
.
went
about
privately
among
the
people
,
-
and
heyan
-
to
teach
the
words
of
Abinadi
;
yea
,
concerning
that
which
was
to
come
,
andalso
concerning
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
,
and
the
redemption
of
the
people
,
which
was
to
be
brought'to
pass
through
the
power
,
and
sufferings
,
and
deathof
Christ
,
and
hisresurrection
and
ascension
into
:
heaven
:
And
as
many
as
would
hear'
his
word
he
did
teach
.
And
he
taught
them
privately
,
that
it
might
not
come
to
.
the
knowledge
of
the
king
..
And
many
did
believe
his
words
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
many
as'did
believe
him
,
didgo
forth
to
a
place
which
was
called
Mormon
;
having
received
its
name
from
the
king
;
be
:
ing'in
the
borders
of
the
land
having
been
.
infested
;
by
times
,
or
at
seasons
,
by
wild
:
beasts
...
Now
there
was
[File:202]
in
:
Mormon
:
a
:
fountain
-
of
puree
water
,
and
:
Alma
-
resorted
thither
,
there
being
near
the
water
a
.
thicket
of
small
trees
,.
where
he
did
hide
himself
in
the
day
-
time
,
from
the
searches
of
the
king
,
And
it
came
to
.
pass
that
.
as
many
as
believed
him
,
went
.
thither
to
hear
his
.
words
.
And
it
came
to
pass
after
many
days
,
there
were
a
goodly
number
gathered
together
to
the
place
of
Mormon
,
to
hear
the
words
of
Alma
.
â
Yea
all
were
gathered
together
that
believed
on
his
word
,
to
hear
him
.
And
he
did
teach
them
,
and
did
preach
unto
them
repentance
,
and
redemption
,
and
faith
on
the
Lord
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
them
,
behold
,
here
.
are
the
waters
of
Mormon
;
for
thus
were
they
called
.
And
now
,
as
ye
are
desirous
to
come
into
the
fold
of
God
,
and
to
be
called
his
people
,
and
are
willing
to
bear
one
another's
burdens
,
that
they
may
be
light
;
yea
,
and
are
willing
to
mourn
with
those
that
mourn
;
yea
,
and
comfort
those
that
stand
.
in
need
of
comfort
,
and
to
stand
as
witnesses
of
God
at
all
times
,
and
in
all
things
,
and
in
all
places
that
ye
may
bein
,
even
until
death
,
that
ye
may
be
redeemed
of
.
God
,
and
be
numbered
with
those
of
the
first
resurrection
,
that
ye
may
have
eternal
life
:
Now
I
say
unto
you
,
if
this
:
be
the
desire
of
your
hearts
,,
what
have
you
against
being
baptized
in
the
name
of
the
Lord
,
asa
witness
before
him
that
ye
have
entered
into
a
covenant
with
him
that
ye
will
serve
him
and
keep
his
commandments
?
that
he
may
pour
out
his
spirit
more
abundantly
upon
you
.
And
now
when
the
people
had
heard
these
words
,
they
clapped
their
.
hands
for
joy
,
and
exclaimed
,
this
is
the
desire
of
our
hearts
.
And
.
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
:
took
Helam
,
he
being
one
of
the
first
,
and
went
and
stood
-
forth
in
the
water
,
and
cried
,
saying
,
O
Lord
,
pour
out
th
spirit
upon
thy
servant
,
that
he
may
do
this
wor
with
holiness
of
heart
.
And
when
.
he
had
said
these
words
,
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
was
upon
him
,
and
.
he
said
,
Helam
,
I
baptize
thee
,
having
authority
from
the
Almighty
.
God
,
as
.
a
testimony
that
ye
have
.
entered
into
a
covenant
to
serve
him
until
youvare
dead
,
as
to
the
-
mortal
,
body
;
and
.
may
.
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
be
poured
out
upon
-
you
;
and
may
he
grant
unto
you
eternal
.
life
,
through
the
redemption
.
of
Christ
,
whom
he
has
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
..
And
after
Alma
had
.
said
:
these
words
,
both
Alma
-
and
:
Helam
.
were
buried
inthe
water
;
and
:
they
arose
-
and
[File:203]
eame
forth
:
out
ofthe
water
rejoicing
,
being
filled
with
.
thespirit
..
And
.
again
,
Alma
:
took
another
,.
and
went
forth
a
second
:
time
:
into
the
water
,
and
baptized
:
him
!
according
to
the
first
,
only
he
did
not
bury
himself
again
in
the
,
water
.
And
after
this
manner
he
.
did
baptize
every
one
.
that
went
forth
to
the
place
of
Mormon
:
and
they
were
in
number
about
two
hundred
and
four
souls
;
yea
,
and
they
were
baptized
in
the
waters
of
Mormon
,
and
were
filled
with
the
grace
of
God
:
and
they
were
called
the
church
of
God
,
or
the
church
of
Christ
,
from
that
time
-
forward
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
was
baptized
by
the
power
and
authority
of
God
,
was
added
to
:
his
elurch
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
,
having
authority
from
God
,
ordained
priests
;
even
one
priest
to
every
fifty
,
of
their
number
did
-
he
ordain
to
preach
unto
them
,
and
to
teach
them
concerning
the
things
pertaining
to
the
kingdom
of
God
.
.
And
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
teach
nothing
save
it
were
the
things
which
he
had
tanght
,
and
which
had
been
spoken
by
the
mouth
ofthe
holy
prophets
,
Yea
,
even
he
:
commanded
them
that
they
should
preach
nothing
saye
it
-
were
repentance
and
faith
on
the
-
Lord
,
who
had
redeemed
his
people
.
And
he
commanded
them
that
there
should
-
be
:
no
.
contention
one
with
another
;
but
that
they
should
look
forward
with
one
eye
,
having
one
faith
and
one
baptism
;
having
their
.
hearts
knit
.
together
in
unity
and
in
love
,
one
towards
another
,
And
thus
he
commanded
them
to
preach
.
And
thus
they
became
the
children
of
God
.
And
he
commanded
them
that
they
-
should
observe
the
Sabbath
day
,
and
:
keep
it
holy
,
and
also
every
day
they
should
give
thanks
to
the
:
Lord
their
God
.
And
he
also
commanded
them
that
the
priests
whom
he
had
:
ordained
should
labor
with
their
own
hands
.
for
their
support
;
and
there
was
one
day
in
every
week
that
was
set
apart
that
they
should
gather
themselves'together
to
teach
the
people
,
and
-
to
:
worship
the
Lord
their
God
,.
and
also
as
often
.
as
it
wasin
their
.
power
;
to
assemble
themselves
together
.
And
the
priests
were
not
to
depend
upon
the
people
for
their
support
;
but
for
their
labor
they
-
ware
to
receive'the
grace
-
of
God
,
that
they
might
wax'strong
in
the
spirit
,
havin
:
the
knowledge
of
God
,
that
they
might
teach
wit
power
and
authority
from
:
God
.
And
again
Alma
commanded
that
the
people
of
the
church
should
im
:
[File:204]
part
of
their
substance
,
-
every
one
according
to
-
that
:
which
he
had
;
if
he
have
more
abundantly
,
he
should
:
impart
more
abundantly
;
and
he
:
that
.
had
but
little
,
but
little
should
:
be
required
;
and
to
him
that
had
not
should
be
given
.
And
thus
they
:
should
.
impart
.
of
their
substance
,
of
their
.
own
free'
will
and
good
:
desires
towards
.
God
,
and
to
those
priests
that
stood
in
need
,
yea
,
and
to
every
needy
,
naked
soul
.
'
And
this
he
said
unto
them
,
having
beencommanded
of
God
;
and
they
did
walk
uprightly
before
God
,
imparting
to
one
another
,
both
temporally
and
spiritually
,
according
to
their
needs
and
their
wants
.
And
now
.
it
came
to
pass
that
all
this
was
done
in
Mormon
;
yea
,
by
the
waters
of
Mormon
,
in
the
forest
that
was
near
the
waters
of
Mormon
:
yea
,
the
place
of
Mormon
,
the
waters
-
of
Mormon
,
the
forest
of
Mormon
,
how
beautiful
are
they
to
the
eyes
of
them
who
there
came
to
the
knowledge
of
their
Redeemer
;
yea
,
and
how
blessed
are
they
;
for
-
they
shall
sing
to
his
praise
forever
.
And
these
things
were
done
in
the
borders
of
the
land
,
that
they
might
not
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
king
.
But
behold
,
it
came
:
to
pass
that
the
king
,
having
discovered
a
movement
among
the
people
,
sent
his
servants
to
watch
them
..
Therefore
on
the
day
that
they
were
assembling
themselves
together
to
hear
the
word
of
.
the
Lord
,
they
were
discovered
unto
the
king
.
And
now
the
king
said
that
Alma
was
stirring
up
the
people
to
rebellion
against
him
;
therefore
he
sent
his
army
:
to
destroy
them
.
And
-
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
,
and
the
people
of
the
Lord
were
apprised
of
the
coming
of
.
the
king's
-
army
;
therefore
they
took
their
tents
and
:
their
families
:
and
departed
into
the
wilderness
.
And
:
they
were
in
number
about
four
hundred
and
fifty/souls
.
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
the
army
of
the
king
returned
,:
having
searched
in
vain
for
the
people
of
the
Lord
.
-
And
now
behold
,
the
forces
of
the
king
were
small
,
having
been
reduced
,-
and
there
-
began
to
bea
division
among
the
remainder
of
the
people
.
And
the
lesser
part
began
to
breathe
out
threatnings
against
the
king
,
and
there
began
to
bea
great
:
contention
among
them
.
And
now
.
there
was
a'
man
among
them
whose
name
was
Gideon
,
and
he
being
a
strong
man
,
and
an
enemy
to
the
king
,
therefore
he'drew
his
sword
and
swore
in
his
wrath
,
that
he
would
slay
.
the
king
:
And
:
it
:
came
topass
-
that
-
he
fought
,
with
the
king
;
and
when
the
:
kingsaw
.
that
he
was
aboutto
[File:205]
overpower
him
,
he
fled
and
ran
and
got
upon
the
towery
which
was
near
the
temple
.
.
And
Gideon
pursued
.
after
him
and
was
about
to
get
upon
tie
tower
to
slay
the
king
,
and
the
king
cast
his
eyes
round
about
towards
the
land
of
Shemlon
,
and
beliold
,
the
army
:
of
the
Lamanites
were
within
the
borders
of
the
.
land
.
And
now
the
king
cried
out
in
the
anguish
of
his
.
soul
,
saying
,
Gideon
,
spare
me
,
for
the
Lamanites
are
upon
us
,
and
they
will
destroy
them
;
yea
,
they
will
destroy
my
people
.
And
now
the
king
was
not
so
much
concerned
about
.
his
people
,
as
he
was
:
about
his
own
life
;
nevertheless
,
Gideon
did
spare
his
life
.
:
And
the
king
-
commanded
the
people
that
they
should
flee
before
the
Lamanites
,
and
he
himself
did
go
before
thems
and
they
did
flee
into
the
wilderness
with
their
women
and
their
children
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
.
pursue
them
,
and
did
overtake
them
,
and
began
to
slay
them
.
Now
.
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
commanded
them
.
that
all
the
men
should
leave
their
wives
and
their
children
,
and
flee
before
the
Lamanites
.
Now
there
were
many
that
would
:
not
leave
them
,
but
had
rather
stay
and
:
perish
with
them
.
And
.
the
rest
left
their
wives
and
their
children
and
fled
.
:
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
.
those
who'
tarried
.
with
their
wives
and
their
children
,
caused
that
their
fair
daughters
should
stand
forth
and
.
plead
with
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
would
not
-
slay
them
.
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
.
had
compassion'on
them
,
for
they
-
were
charmed
with
the
beauty
:
of
their
women
;
therefore
the
Lamanites
did
spare
their
lives
,
and
took
them
captives
,
and
carried
them
back
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
and
granted
unto
them
that
they
might
possess
the
land
,
under
the
conditions
that
they
would
deliver
:
up
king
Noah
into
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
.
deliver
.
up
their
property
,
even
.
one
-
halfof
.
all
they'possessed
;.
one
half
of
their
gold
,
and_
their
silver
,
and
all
their
precious
things
;
and
.
thus
they
should
pay
tribute
10
:
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
,.
from
year
to
.
year
.
.
And
now
there
was
one
of
.
the
:
sons
of
the
king
among
those
that
were
.
taken
captive
,
whose
name
-
was
Limhi
..
And
now
.
Limhi
was
.
desirous
that
his
father
should
not
:
be
destroyed
;
nevertheless
,
Lim
-:
hi
was
not
ignorant
of
the
iniquities
.
of
his
:
father
;
he
himself
,
being
a
just
-
man
.
pichitiiogs
And
,
it
came
-
to
:
pass
that
Gideon
:
sent
men
into
the
wilderness
secretly
,
to
search
for
the
.
king
,
and
those
[File:206]
that
were
with
him
.
And
:
it
came
to
.
pass
that'
they
met
the
people
in
the
wilderness
,
all
save
the
king
and
his
priests
.
Now
they
:
had
sworn
in
their
hearts
that
they
would
return
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
and
if
.
their
wives
and
their
children
were
-
slain
,
and
also
.
those
that
had
tarried
with
them
,
that
they
would
seek
revenge
,.
and
also
.
perish
with
them
.
And
the
king
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
-
return
;
and
they
were
angry
with
the
king
,
and
caused
that
he
should
suffer
,
even
unto
death
by
fire
.
And
they
were
about
to
take
the
priesis
also
and
-
put
them
to
death
,
and
they
fled
before
them
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
about
to
return
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
and
they
met
the
men
of
.
Gideon
.
And
the
men
of
Gideon
told
them
of
all
that
had
happened
to
their
wives
and
their
children
;
and
that
the
Lamanites
had
.
granted
unto
them
that
they
might
possess
the
land
,
by
paying
a
tribute
to
the
Lamanites
of
one
half
of
all
they
possessed
.
-
And
)
the
people
told
the
men
of
Gideon
that
they
had
slain
the
king
,
and
his
priests
had
fled
from
them
:
farther
into
the
wilderness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
ended
the
ceremony
,
that
they
returned
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
rejoicing
,
because
their
wives
and
their
children
were
not
slain
;
and
they
told
Gideon
what
they
had
done
to
the
king
.
i
nd
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
made
an
oath
unto
them
,
that
his
people
should
not
slay
them
.
And
also
Limhi
,
being
the
son
of
the
king
,
having
the
kingdom
conferred
upon
him
by
the
people
,
made
oath
unto
the
king
.
of
ithe
Lamanites
,
that
his
people
should
:
pay
tribute
unto
him
,
even
one
half
of
all
they
possessed
.
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Limhi
began'
to
establish
the
kingdom
,
and
to
establish
peace
among
his
people
.
And
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
set
guards
round
about
the
Jand
,
that
he
might
-
keep
the
people
of
Linhi
in
the
land
,
that
they
might
not
depart
into
the
wilderness
;
and
he
did
support
his
guards
out
of
the
tribute
which
he
did
receive
from
the
Nephites
.
And
now
king
Limhi
did
have
continual
peace
in
his
kingdora
,
forthe
space
of
two
years
,
that
the
Lamanites
did
not
molest
them
nor
seek
to
destroy
them
.
Now
there
was
a
.
place
-
in
Shemlon
,
where
the
daughters
of
the
Lamanites
did
:
gather
themselves
together
tosing
,
andto'
dance
;
and
:
to'
make'
themselves
merry
.
And
it
canie
:
to
pass
that
.
there
was
one
day
[File:207]
a
small
number
of
them
gathered
.
together
to
sing
and
to
dance
...
And
:-
now
the
priests
of
Sane
Noah
,
being
ashamed
to
return
to
the
city
of
Nephi
,
yea
,
and
.
also
fearing
that
the
people
would
slay
them
,
therefore
they
durst
not
return
to
their
:
wives
and
their
children
.
And
having
tarried
in
-
the
wilderness
,
and
-
having
discovered
the
daughters
.
of
the
Lamanites
,
'
they
laid
and
watched
them
;
-
and
-
when
there
-
were
but
.
few
of
them
gathered
together
.
to
dance
,
they
came
forth
out
of
their
secret
places
,
and
took
them
and
carried
them
into
the
wilderness
;
yea
,
twenty
and
four
of
the
daughters
of
the
Lamanites
-
they
carried
into
the
wilderness
.
+
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lamanites
found
that
their
daughters
had
been
missing
,
they
were
angry
with
the
people
of
Limhi
;
for
they
thought
it
was
the
people
of
Limhi
.
Therefore
they
sent
.
their
armies
.
forth
;
yea
,
even
the
king
himself
went
before
his
people
;
and
:
they
went
up
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
to
destroy
the
people
of
Limhix
And
now
Limhi
had
discovered
them
from
the
tower
;
even
.
all
their
preparations
for
war
did
he
discover
;
therefore
he
gathered
his
people
together
,
and
laid
wait
for
them
.
in
the
fields
,
and
in
the
forests
.
And
it
came
to
.
pass
that
when
the
Lamanites
had
come
up
,
that
:
the
people
of
Limhi
began
to
fall
upon
them
from
their
waiting
places
,
and
began
to
slay
them
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
battle
became
exceeding
.
sore
,
for
they
fought
.
like
lions
for
.
their
prey
..
And
it
came
to
.
pass
that
the
.
people
of
Limhi
.
began
to
drive
the
Lamanites
before
.
them
,
yet
they
were
not
half
so
.
numerous
as
the
Lamanites
..
But
they
fought
for
their
lives
,
and
for
their
wives
,
and
.
for
their
children
;
therefore
they
exerted
themselves
,
and
like
dragons
did
they
fight
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
.
they
found
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
among
the
number
of
their
dead
;
yet
he
was
not
dead
,
having
been
wounded
and
left
upon
the
ground
,
so
speedy
was
the
flight
-
of
his
.
people
...
And
they
took
him
and
:
bound
up
.
his
wounds
,
and
brought
him
.
before
Limhi
,
and
.
said
,
behold
,
here
is
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
;
he
.
having
received
a
wound
,
hag
fallen
among
:
their
dead
,
and
.
they
have
left
him
;
and
behold
,.
we
have
.
brought
him
before
you
;..
and
now
.
let
us
sluy
him
.
;
But
Limhi
.
said
.
unto
them
,
ye
shall
not
slay
.
him
,
but
)
bring
:.
him
:
hither
,
that
I
may
.
gee
him
.
[File:208]
And
they
brought
him
.
And
Limhi
said
unto
him
,
what
cause
have
ye
to
come
up
to
war
:
against
my
people
?
Behold
,
my
people
have
not
broken
the
oath
that
I
madeunto
you
;
therefore
,
why
should
ye
break
the
oath
which
ye
made
unto
my
people
?
And
now
the
king
said
,
I
have
broken
the
oath
,
because
thy
people
did
carry
away
the
daughters
of
my
people
;
therefore
in
my
anger
I
did
cause
my
people
to
come
up
to
war
against
thy
people
.
Now
Limhi
had
heard
nothing
concerning
this
matter
;
therefore
he
said
,
I
will
search
among
my
people
,
and
whosoever
has
done
this
thing
shall
perish
.
Therefore
he
caused
a
search
to
be
made
among
his
people
.
Now
when
Gideon
had
heard
these
things
,
he
being
the
king's
eaptain
,
he
went
forth
and
said
unto
the
king
,
J
pray
thee
forbear
,
and
do
not
search
this
peopla
,
and
lay
not
this
thing
to
their
charge
.
For
do
ye
not
remem
ber
the
priests
of
thy
father
,
whom
this
people
sought
to
destroy
?
And
are
they
not
in
the
wilderness
?
And
are
not
they
the
ones
who
have
stolen
the
daughters
of
the
Lamanites
?
And
now
behold
,:
and
tell
the
king
of
these
things
,
that
he
may
tell
his
people
,
that
they
may
be
pacitied
towards
us
:
for
behold
me
are
already
preparing
to
come
against
us
;
and
behold
al
:
so
,
there
are
but
few
of
us
.
And
behold
;
they
come
with
their
numerous
hosts
;
and
except
the
king
doth
pacify
them
towards
us
,
we
must
perish
.
-
For
are
not
the
words
of
Abinadi
fulfilled
,
which
he
prophesied
against
us
?
and
all
this
because
we
would
not
hearken
unto
the
word
of
the
Lord
,
and
turn
from
our
iniquities
?)
And
now
let
us
pacify
the
king
,
and
we
fulfil
the
oath
which
we
have
made
unto
him
:
for
it
is
better
that
we
should
be
in
bondage
,
than
:
that
we
should
lose
our
lives
;
therefore
,
let
us
put
a
stop
to
the
shedding
of
so
much
blood
.
And
now
Limhi
told
the
king
all
the
things
concerning
his
father
,
and
the
priests
that
had
fled
into
the
wilderness
,
and
attributed
the
carrying
away
of
their
daughters
to
them
.
And
it
came'to
pass
that
.
the
king
was
pacified
towards
his
people
;
and
he
said
)
unto
them
,.
let
us
go
forth
to
.
meet
my
people
,
without
arms
;
and'
Iswear
unto
you
with
an
oath
,
that
my
people
shall
not
slay
thy
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
followed
the
king
,
and
went
forth
without
arms
:
to
-
meet
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
-
to
pass
that
they
did
meet
the
Lamanites
;
andthe
king
of
the
Lamanites
did
bow
himself
down
before
them
,
and
did
plead
in
be
[File:209]
half
of
the
people
of
Limhi
..
And
when
the
Lamanites
saw
the
people
of
Limhi
,
that
they
were
without
arms
,
they
:
had
compassion
on
them
,
and
were
pacified
towards
them
,
and
returned
with
their
king
in
peace
to
their
own
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Limhi
and_his
people
returned
to
the
city
of
Nephi
,
and
began
to
dwell
in
the
land
again
in
peace
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
many
days
,
the
Lamanites
began
again
to
be
stiired
up
in
anger
against
the
Nephites
;
and
they
began
to
comeinto
the
borders
of
the
land
round
about
.
,
Now
they
durst
not
slay
them
,
because
of
the
oath
which
their
king
had
made
unto
Limhi
;
but
they
would
smite
them
on
their
cheeks
,
and
exercise
authority
over
them
;
and
began
to
put
heavy
burdens
upon
their
.
backs
,
and
drive
them
as
they
would
a
-
dumb
ass
;
yea
,
all
this
was
done
,
that
the
word
of
the
Lord
might
be
fulfilled
.
And
now
the
afflictions
of
the
Nephites
.
were
great
;
and
there
was
no
way
that
they
could
deliver
themselves
out
of
their
hands
,
for
the
Lamanites
:
had
surrounded
them
on
every
side
.
And
it
came
.
to
pass
that
the
people
:
began
to
murmur
with
the
king
,
because
of
theirafflictions
;
and
they
began
to
be
desirous
to
goagainst
them
to
battle
.
And
they
did
afflict
the
king
sorely
with
their
complaints
;
therefore
he
granted
unto
them
that
they
should
do
according
to
their
desires
.
.
And
they
gathered
.
themselves
together
again
,
and
put
on
their
armour
,
and
went
forth
-
against
the
_Lamanites
,
to
drive
them
out
of
their
land
.
And
it
came
to
pasg
that
the
Lamanites
did
beat
them
,
and
drove
them
back
,
and
slew
many
,
of
them
.
And
.
now
there
was
a
.
great
mourning
and
lamentation
among
the
people
of
lim
hi
;
the
widow
mourning
for
her
husband
;
the
sonand
the
daughter
mourning
for
their
father
;
and
the
brothers
for
their
brethren
.
Now
there
were
a
great
many
widows
in
the
land
;
and
they
did
cry
mightily
from
day
to
day
,
for
a
great
fear
of
the
Lamanites
had
come
upon
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
their
continual
eries
did
stir
up
.
the
remainder
of
the
people
of
Limhi
to
anger
,
against
the
Lamanites
.
And
they
.
went
again
to
battle
;
but
.
they
were
driven
back
again
,
suffering
much
loss
.;.
Yea
,
they
went
again
,
even
.
the
third
time
,
and
suffered
in
the
like
.
manner
;:
and
those
that
were
not
slain
,
returned
again
to
the
city
of
Nephi
.
.
And
they
:
did
.
humble
:
themselves
:
even
to
the
dust
,
subjecting
themselves
to
the
yoke
of
bondage
,
.
[File:210]
submitting
themselves
:
to
be
smitten
,
and
tobe
driven
to
and
fro
,
and
burdened
,
according
to
:
the
:
desires
:
of
their
enemies
,
'
And
they
did
-
humble
themselves
even
in
the
depths
of
humility
;
and
they
did
cry
mightily
to
God
;
yea
,
even
all
the
day
long
did
they
ery
unto
their
God
,
that
he
would
deliver
them
out
of
.
their
afflictions
.
And
now
the
Lord
was
slow
to
hear
their
cry
,
because
of
their
iniquities
;
nevertheless
the
Lord
did
hear
their
cmes
,
and
began
to
soften
the
hearts
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
began
to
ease
their
burdens
;
yet
the
Lord
did
not
see
fit
to
deliver
them
out
of
bondage
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
prosper
by
degrees
in
the
land
,
and
began
to
raise
grain
mere
abundantly
,
and
-
flocks
,
and
herds
,
that
they
did
not
suffer
withhunger
.
Now
.
there
was
a
great
number
of
women
more
than
there
was
of
men
;
therefore
king
Limhi
commanded
that
every
man
should
impart
to
the
support
of
the
widows
and
their
children
,
that
they
might
not
perish
with
hunger
:
and
this
they
did
,
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
number
that
had
been
slain
.
Now
the
people
of
Limhi
kept
together
ina
body
as
muchas
it
was
possible
,
and
-
secure
their
grain
,
and
their
flocks
;
and
the
king
himself
did
not
trust
his
person
without
the
walls
-
of
the
city
,
unless
he
took
his
guards
with
him
,
fearing
that
he
might
by
some
means
fail
into
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
.-
And
he
caused
that
his
people
should
watch
the
land
round
about
,
that
by
.
some
means
they
might
take
those
priests
that
fled
into
the
wilderness
,
who
had
.
stolen
the
daughters
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
that
had
caused
such
a
great
destruction
to
:
come
.
upon
them
;
for
the
were
desirous
to
take
them
,
that
they
might
punis
them
:
for
they
had
:
come
into
the
Jand
of
Nephi
by
night
,
and
carried
off
their
grain
,
and
many
of
their
precious
things
;
therefore
they
laid
:
wait
for
ther
.
And
it
came
to
:
pass
that
-
there
wasmo
more
disturbance
between
:
the
.
Lamanites
:
and
the
people
of
Limhi
,
even
until
the
time
that'Ammon
and
his
brethren
eame
into
the
land
.
And
the
king
having
been
without
the
gates
of
the
city
with
his
guard
,.
discovered
Ammon
and
his
brethren
;
and
supposing
them
.
to
be
priestsof
Noah
,
therefore
-
he
caused
that
they
:
should
be
taken
,
and
bound
,
and
east
into
prison
.
.
-
And
-
had
they
been
the
priests
of
Noah
,
he
would
have
caused
that
they
should
be
put'
to
death
;
butwhen
:
he
found
that
they
were
-
not
,
but
that
they
were
his
:
brethren
;
[File:211]
and
.
had
come
:
from
the
land
:
of
Zarahemla
,
he
was
filled
with
exceeding
great
joy
.
_Now
king
Limhi
had
sent
,-
previous
to
the
coming
of
Ammon
,.
a
small
number
of
nen
to
search
for
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
but
they
could
not
find
it
;
and
they
were
lost
in
the
wilderness
.
Nevertheless
they
did
find
a
land
which
had
been
peopled
;
yea
,
a
land
which
was
covered
with
dry
bones
;
yea
,
a
land
which
had
been
peopled
,
and
which
had
been
destroyed
;
and
they
having
supposed
it
to
be
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
returned
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
having
arrived
in
the
borders
of
the
land
not
many
days
before
the
coming
of
Ammon
.
And
they
brought
a
record
.
with
them
,
even
a
record
of
the
people
whose
bones
they
had
found
;
and
they
were
engraven
.
on
plates
of
ore
.
'
And
now
Limhi
was
again
filled
with
joy
,
on
learning
from
.
the
mouth
of
Ammon
that
king
Masia
had
a
gift
-
from
God
;
whereby
he
could
:
interpret
such
engravings
;
yea
,
and
Ammonalso
did
rejoice
,
Yet
Ammon
and
his
-
brethren
were
filled
with
sorrow
,
because
so
many
of
their
brethren
had
been
slain
;
and
also
that
king
Noah
and
his
priests
had
caused
the
people
tocommit
.
so
many
sins
and
iniquities
against
God
;
and
they
also
:
did
mourn
for
the
death
of
Abinadi
;
and
also
for
the
departure
:
of
Alma
,
and
the
people
that
went
with
him
,
who
had
formed
.
a
.
church
,
of
.
God
through
:
the
strength
and
:
power
of
God
,
and
faith
on
the
words
which
had
:
been
.
spoken
by
Abinadi
;
yea
,
they
did
mourn
for
their
departure
,
for
they
knew
.
not
whither
they
had
fled
.
Now
they
would
have
gladly
joined
with
them
,-
forthey
themselves
had
entered
into
a
covenant
with
God
,
to
serve
him
,
and
keep
his
commandments
:
.
And
now
since
the
coming
of
Ammon
king
Limhi
had
also
entered
into
a
covenant
with
God
,
and
also
many
of
his
people
;
to
serve
him
,
and
keep
his
commandments
.
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Limhi
-
and
many
-
of
his
people
were
:-
desirous
to
be
baptized
;
but
there
was
none
inthe
land
that
had
-
authority
from
God
.
And
Ammon
declined
doing
this
thing
,
considering
himself
an
unworthy
servant
;
therefore
they
did
not
.
at
;
that
time
form
themselves
into
a
church
,
waiting
upon
the
spirit
of
the
:
Lord
)
Now
:
they
were
desirous
to
become
evenvas
Alma
andvhis
.
brethren
;
who
had
fled
into
the
wilderness
.
They
were
desirous
te
be
baptized
;
as
a
witness
and
a
testimony
that
they
were
willing
to
serve
God
withall
-
their
hearts
;
nevertheless
they
did
prolong
the
time
;
and
an
account
of
their
baptismshall
[File:212]
be
given
hereafter
.
And
:
now
-
all
the
study
of
Ammon
and
his
people
,
and
king
Limhi
and
his
.
peaple
,
was
to
deliver
themselves
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
from
bondage
.
i
CHAPTER
X
.
Axp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Ammon
and
king
Limhi
began
to
consult
with
the
people
how
they
should
deliver
themselves
out
of
bondage
;
and
even
they
did
cause
that
all
the
people
should
gather
themselves
together
:
and
this
they
did
that
they
might
have
the
voice
of
the
.
people
concerning
the
matter
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
could
find
no
way
to
deliver
themselves
out
of
bondage
,
except
it
were
to
take
their
women
and
children
,
and
their
flocks
,
and
their
herds
,
and
their
tents
,
and
depart
into
the
wilderness
:
for
the
Lamanites
being
.
so
.
numerous
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
people
of
Limhi
to
contend
with
them
,
thinking
to
deliver
themselves
out
of
bondage
by
the
sword
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
Gideon
went
forth
and
stood
before
the
king
,
and
said
unto
him
,
now
O
king
,
thou
hast
hitherto
hearkened
unto
my
words
many
times
when
we
have
been
contending
with
our
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
,
And
now
O
king
,
if
thou
hast
not
found
me
to
be
an
unprofitable
servant
,
or
if
thou
hast
hitherto
listened
to
my
words
in
any
degree
,
and
they
have
been
of
service
to
.
thee
,
even
so
I
desire
that
thou
wouldst
listen
to
my
words
at
this
time
,
and
I
will
be
thy
servant
,
and
deliver
this
people
out
of
bondage
.
And
the
king
granted
unto
him
that
he
migh
speak
.
And
Gideon
said
unto
him
,
behold
the
back
pass'
through
the
back
wall
,
on
the
back
side
of
the
city
.
The
Lamanites
,
or
the
guards
of
the
Lamanites
,
by
night
,
are
drunken
;
therefore
letus
send
a
proclamation
among
all
this
people
,
that
they
gather
together
their
flocks
and
herds
,
that
they
may
drive
them
into
the
wilderness
by
night
.
And
I
will
go
according
to
thy
command
,
and
pay
the
last
tribute
of
wine
.
to
the
Lamanites
,
and
they
will
be
drunken
;
and
,
we
will
pass
through
the
secret
.
pass
.
on
the
left
.
of
the
camp
,
when
they
are
drunken
and
asleep
:
thus
we
will
depart
with
our
women
-
and
our
children
,
our
flocks
[File:213]
and
our
-
herds
,
into
the
wilderness
;
and
we
will
travel
around
the
land
of'Shilom
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
Gideon
.:
And
king
Limhi
caused
that
his
people
should
gather
their
flocks
together
;
and
he
sent
the
tribute
of
wine
to
the
Lamanites
;
and
he
also
sent
more
wine
,
as
a
present
unto
them
:
and
they
did
drink
freely
of
the
wine
which
king
Limhi
did
send
unto
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
king
Limbi
did
depart
by
night
into
the
wilderness
with
their
fiocks
end
their
herds
,
and
they
went
round
about
the
land
of
Shilom
in
the
wilderness
,
and
bent
their
course
towards
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
being
led
by
Ammon
and
his
brethren
.
And
they
had
taken
all
their
gold
,
and
silver
,
and
their
precious
things
,
which
they
could
carry
;
and
also
their
provisions
with
them
,
into
the
wilderness
;
and
they
pursued
their
journey
.
And
after
being
many
days
in
the
wildesness
,
they
arrived
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
joined
his
people
,
and
became
his
subjects
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Mosiah
received
them
with
joy
;
and
he
also
received
their
records
,
and
also
the
records
which
had
been
found
by
the
people
of
Limhi
.
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
when
the
Lamanites
had
found
that
the
people
of
Limhi
had
departed
out
of
the
land
by
night
,
that
they
sent
an
army
into
the
wilderness
to
pursue
them
;
and
after
they
had
pursued
them
two
days
,
they
could
no
longer
follow
their
tracks
;
therefore
they
were
lost
in
the
wilderness
.

Now
Alma
,
having
been
warned
of
the
Lord
that
the
armies
of
king
Noah
would
come
upon
them
,
and
had
made
it
known
to
his
people
,
therefore
they
gathered
together
their
flocks
,
and
took
of
their
grain
,
and
deiter
into
the
wildertiess
before
-
the
armies
of
king
.
oah
.
And
the
Lord
did
strengthen
them
,
that
the
people
of
king
Noah'
could
not
overtake
them
,
'to
de
[File:214]
stroy
them
.-.
And
they
fled
eight
:
days'
journey
into
the
wilderness
,
.
And
they
cametoia
land
,
yea
,
even
:
a
very
.
beautifiland
.
pleasant
land
;
:
ailand
of
pure
water
.
And
they
.
pitched
-
their
.
tents
,
and
:
began
.
to
till
the
..
ground
,
and
:
began
.
to
build
,
buildings
,
&c
.;
yea
,
they
were
industrious
,
and
-
did
labor
,
exceedingly
,
And
the
people
were
desirous
that
.
Alma
should
be
their
king
,
for
he
was
beloved
by
his
.
people
..
But
he
said'unto
them
,
behold
,
it
.
is
not
,
expedient
that
we
should
have
a
-
king
;
for
.
thus
saith
,
the
Lord
:
Ye
shall
not
esteem
one
flesh
.
above
another
;
er
one
man
shall
-
not
think
himself
above
another
;.
therefore
I
say
unto
you
,
it
is
not
expedient
that
ye
should
havea
king
.
-
Nevertheless
,
if
it
were
possible
that
.
ye
could
always
have
just
men
to
be
-
your
kings
,
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
have
a
king
.
But
remember
the
iniquity
of
king
Noah
and
his
priests
:
and
.
I
-
myself
was
caught
-
in
a
snare
,
and
-
did
-
many
things
which
were
abominable
in
the
sight
of
the
Lord
,
which
caused
me
sore
repentance
;
nevertheless
,
after
much
.
tribulation
,
the
Lord
didj
hear
my
cries
,
and
did
answer
my
prayers
,
and
has
made
me
an
instrument
in
-
his
hands
,
in
-
bringing
so
many
of
you
to
a
knowledge
of
his
truth
.
Nevertheless
,
in
this
I
do
not
glory
,
for
I
am
unworthy
to
glory
of
myself
..
And
now
.
I
say
unto
you
,
ye
have
been
oppressed
by
king
Noah
,
and
have
been
in
bondage
to
him
and
his
priests
,
and
have
been
brought
into
iniquity
by
them
;
therefore
-
ye
were
bound
with
the
bands
of
iniquity
.
And
now
as
ye
have
been
delivered
,
by
the
power
of
God
,
out
of
these
bonds
;
yea
,
even
out
of
the
hands
of
king
Noah
and
his
people
,
and
also
from
.
the
bonds
of
iniquity
,
even
so
I
desire
that
ye
should
stand
fast
in
this
liberty
wherewith
ye
have
been
made
free
,
and
that
ye
trust
no
man
to
bea
king
over
you
;
andalso
trusting
no
one
to
be
your
teacher
nor
your
minister
,
except
he
be
a
man
of
God
,
wa
!
king
.
in
his
ways
and
keeping
his
eommandments
.
Thus
.
did
Alma
teach
his
people
,
that
every
man
should
love
his
neighbor
as
himself
:
that
there
should
be
no
contention
among
them
.
And
now
Alma
was
their
high
priest
,
he
being
the
founder
of
their
church
.
And
it
came
to
.
pass
that
none
received
authority
to
preach
orto
:
teach
,
except
it
.
were
by
him
from
God
,
Therefore
he
consecrated
all
their
priests
,
and
.
all
.
their
.
deachers
,
.
and
-
none
:
were
.
consecrated
except
.
they
were
just
men
.
Therefore
they
did
-
watch
.
over
-
their
people
,
and
did
.
nourish
them
[File:215]
with
things
pertaining
to
righteousness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
prosper
exceedingly
in
the
land
;.
and
they
called
the
land
Helam
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
multiply
and
prosper
exceeding]
in
the
land
of
Helam
;
and
they
built
a
city
,
whic
they
called
the
cityof
Helam
.
Nevertheless
the
Lord
seeth
fit
to
chasten
his
people
;
yea
,
he
trieth
their
patience
and
their
faith
.
Nevertheless
,
whosoever
puteth
his
trust
in
him
,
the
same
shall
be
lifted
up
.
at
the
last
day
.
Yea
,
and
thus
it
was
with
this
people
.
For
behold
,
I
will
shew
unto
you
that
they
were
brought
into
bondage
,
and
none
could
deliver
them
but
the
Lord
their
God
;
yea
,
even
the
.
God
of
Abraham
and
Isaac
,
and
of
Jacob
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
deliver
them
,
and
he
did
shew
forth
hig
mighty
power
unto
them
,
and
great
were
their
rejoicings
.
or
behold
;
it
came
to
pass
that
while
they
were
in
the
land
of
Helam
,
yea
,
in
the
city
of
Helam
,
while
tilling
the
land
round
about
,
behold
an
army
of
the
Lamanites
were
in
the
borders
of
the
land
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brethren
of
Alma
fled
from
their
fields
,
and
gathered
themselves
together
into
the
city
of
Helam
;
and
they
were
much
frightened
because
of
the
appearance
of
the
Lamanites
.
But
Alma
went
forth
and
stood
among
them
,
and
exhorted
them
that
they
should
not
be
frightened
,
but
that
they
should
,
remember
the
Lord
their
God
,
and
he
would
deliver
them
;
therefore
they
hushed
their
fears
,
and
began
to
cry
unto
the
Lord
,
that
he
would
soften
the
hearts
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
would
spare
them
,
and
their
wives
,
and
their
children
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
soften
the
hearts
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
Alma
and
his
brethren
went
forth
and
delivered
themselyes
up
into
their
hands
;
and
the
Lamanites
took
possession
of
the
land
or
Helam
.
Now
the
armiesof
the
Lamanites
which
had
followed
after
the
people
of
king
Limhi
,
had
been
lost
in
the
wilderness
for
many
days
.
And
behold
,
they
had
found
.
those
priests
:
of
king
Noah
,
in
a
place
which
they
called
Amulon
;
and
they
had
began
to
possess
the
land
of
Amalon
,
and
had
began
to
till
the
ground
.
Now
the
name
of
.
the
leader
of
those
priests
was
Amulon
.
And
it
came
:
to
pane
chat
Amulon
did
.
plead
with
the
Lamaniteg
;
and
e
also
sent
forth
their
wives
,
who
were
the
daughters
of
the
Lamanites
,..
to
plead
with
their
.
brethren
,
that
they
should
not
destroy
their
husbands
,
.
And
:
the
La
[File:216]
manites
had
cempassiononAmulon
and
his
brethren
,
and
did
not
destroy
them
,
because
of
their
wives
..
And
Amilon
and
-
his'
brethren
did
join
the
Lamanites
,
and
they
were
traveling
in
the
wilderness
in
search
of
the
land
of
Nephi
,
when
they
discovered'the
land
of
Helam
,
which
was
possessed
by
Alma
and
his
brethren
.
And
it'came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
promised
unto
Alma
and
his
brethren
,
that
if
they
would
shew
them
the
way
which
led
to
the
-
land
of
Nephi
,
that
they
would
grant
unto
them
their
livesand
their
diberty
.
But
after
Alma
had
shewn
them
the
way
that
led
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
the
Lamanites
would
not
keep
their
promise
;
but
they
set
guards
round
about
the
land
of
Helam
,
over
Alma
and
his
brethren
.
And
the
remainder
of
them
went
to
the
land
of
Nephi
;
and
-
a
part
of
them
returned
:
to
the
land
of
Helam
,
and
also
brought
with
them
the
wives
and
the
children
of
the
guards
who
had
been
left
in
the
land
.
And
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
had
granted
unto
Amulon
that
he
should
be
a
king
anda
ruler
over
his
people
,
who
were
in
the
land
of
Helam
;
nevertheless
he
should
have
no
power
to
do
any
thing
contrary
to
the
will
of
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amulon
did
gain
favorin
the
eyes
of
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
;
therefore
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
granted
unto
him
and
his
brethren
,
thut
they
should
be
appointed
:
teachers
over
his
people
;
yea
,
even
over
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
of
Shemlon
,
and
in
the
land
of
Shilom
,
and'
in
the
land
of
Amulon
:
for
the
Lamanites
had
taken
possession
of
all
these
lands
;
therefore
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
had
appointed
kings
over
all
these
lands
..
And
now
the
name
of
the
-
king
of
the
Lamanites
was
Laman
,
being
called
after
the
name
of
his
-
father
;
and
therefore
he
was
called
king
Laman
.
And
he
was
king
over
anumerous
people
;
and
he
appointed
teachers
.
of
the
brethren
of
Amulon
,
in
every
land
.
which
was
possessed
by
his
people
:
and
thus
the
language
of
Nephi
beggn
to
be
taught
among
all
the
people
of
the
Lamanites
.
'
And
they
werea
people
friendly
one
with
another
;
nevertheless
they
knew
not
God
;
neither
did
the
brethren
of
Ammon
teach
them
any
thing
concert
ing
the
Lord
their
God
,
neither
the
law
of
Moses
:
nor
didthey
teach
them
the
words
of
Abinadi
;
but
they
taught
them
that
they
should
keep
their
record
,
that
they
might
write
one
.
to
another
.
And
thus
the
Lamanites
began
to
increase
in
riches
,
and
bega
!
[File:217]
to
trade
.
one
with
another
,
and
wax
great
,
and
began
to
be
a
cunning
and
a
wise
people
,
as
to
the
wisdom
of
the
world
;
yea
,
a
very
cunning
people
;
delighting
in
all
manner
of
wickedness
and
plunder
,
except
it
were
among
their
own
brethren
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Amulon
began
to
exercise
authority
over
Alma
and
his
brethren
,
and
began
to
.
persecute
him
,
and
cause
that
his
children
should
persecute
their
children
:
for
Amulon
knew
Alina
,
that
-
>he
had
been
one
of
the
king's
priests
,
and
that
it
.
was
he
that
believed
the
words
of
Abinadi
,
and
was
driven
out
before
the
king
;
and
therefore
he
was
wroth
with
him
,
for
he
was
subject
.
to
king
Laman
;
yet
he
exercised
authority
over
.
them
,
and
put
.
tasks
upon
them
,
and
put
task
-
masters
over
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
so
great
were
their
afflictions
,
that
they
began
to
cry
mightily
to
God
.
And
Amulon
commanded
.
them
that
they
should
stop
their
cries
;
and
he
put
guards
over
them
to
watch
them
,
that
.
whosoeyer
should
be
found
calling
upon
God
,
should
be
put
to
death
.
And
Alma
and
his
people
did
not
raise
their
voices
tothe
Lord
their
God
,
but
did
pour
out
their
hearts
to
him
;
and
he
did
know
the
thoughts
of
their
hearts
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
Lord
came
to
them
in
their
afflictions
,
saying
,
lift
up
your
heads
and
he
of
good
comfort
,
for
I
,
know
of
the
covenant
which
ye
have
made
unto
me
;
and
I
will
covenant
.
with
my
people
,
and
deliver
them
out
of
bondage
..
And
JT
willalso
ease
the
burdens
which
are
put
-
upon
,
your
shoulders
,
that
even
you
.
cannot
feel
.
them
upon
your
.
backs
,
even
while
you
are
in
,
bondage
;
and
this
.
will
]
do
,
that
ye
may
stand
as
witnesses
for
me
here
-.
atler
,
and
-
that
ye
may
know
of
a
surety
that
I
,
the
Lord
:
God
,
do
visit
my
.
people
.

And
:

people
,
and
:
[File:218]
I
will
go
with
thee
,
and
deliver
this'
people
out
ofbondage
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
and
his
-
people
in
the
night
time
,
gathered
their
flocks
together
,
and
als
so
of
their
grain
;
yea
,
even
all
the
night
time
were
they
gathering
their
flocks
together
.
And
in
the
morning
the
Lord
caused
a
deep
sleep
to
come
upon
the
Lamanites
,
yea
,
and
all
their
task
-
masters
were
in
a
profound
sleep
.
And
Alma
and
his
people
departed
into
the
wilderness
;
and
when
they
had
traveled
all
day
,
they
pitched
their
tents
in
a
valley
,
and
they
called
the
valley
Alma
,
because
he
led
their
way
in
the
wilderness
;
yea
,
and
in
the
valley
of
Alma
they
poured
out
their
thanks
to
God
because
he
had
been
merciful
unto
them
,
and
eased
their
burdens
,
and
had
delivered
them
out
of
bondage
;
for
they
were
in
bondage
,
and
none
could
deliver
them
,
except
it
were
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
they
gave
thanks
to
God
,
yeajall
their
men
,
and
all
their
women
,
and
all
their
children
,
that
could
speak
,
lifted
their
voices
in
the
praises
of
their
God
.
And
now
the
Lord
said
unto
Alma
,
haste
thee
and
get
thou
and
this
people
out
of
this
land
,
for
the
Lamanites
have
awoke
and
do
pursue
thee
;
therefore
get
thee
out
of
this
land
,
and
I
will
stop
the
Lamanites
in
this
valley
,
that
they
come
no
further
in
pursuit
of
this
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
departed
out
of
the
valley
,
and
took
their
journey
into
the
wilderness
.
And
after
they
had
been
in
the
wilderness
twelve
days
,
they
arrived
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
and
king
Mosiah
did
also
receive
them
with
joy
,
And
now
king
Mosiah
caused
that
all
the
people
should
be
gathered
together
.
Now
there
were
not
so
many
0
!
the
children
of
Nephi
,
or
so
many
of
those
who
were
descendants
of
Nephi
,
as
there
were
of
the
people
of
Zarzhemla
,
who
was
a
descendant
of
Mulok
,
and
those
who
came
with
him
into
the
wilderness
;
and
there
were
not
so
many
of
the
people
of
Nephi
and
of
the
people
of
Zarahemla
as
there
were
of
the
Lamanites
:
yea
,
they
were
not
half
so
numerous
.
And
now
all
the
people
of
Nephi
were
assembled
together
,
and
also
all
the
people
of
Zarahemla
,
and
they
were
gathered
together
in
two
bodies
.
And
it
came
to'pass
that
Mosiah
did
read
;
and
:
caused'to
be
read
,
the
records
of
Zeniff
to
his
people
;
yea
;
he
read
the'
records'of
the
people
of
Zeniff
;
from
:
the
time
they
left
the
land
of
Zarahemla
until
they
returo
[File:219]
edagain
.
And
he
also
read
the
account
of
Alma
and
his
brethren
,
and
all
their
afflictions
,:
from
the
time
they
left
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,.
until
the
time
they
returned
again
.
And
now
when
Mosiah
had
.
made
an
end
of
reading
the
records
,
his
people
who
tarried
:
din
the
land
were
struck
with
wonder
and
amazement
,
for
they
knew
not
what
to
think
;
for
when
they
beheld
those
that
had
been
delivered
out
of
bondage
,
they
were
filled
with
exceeding
great
joy
.
And
again
,
when
they
thought
of
their
brethren
who
had
been
slain
by
the
Lamanites
,
they
were
filled
with
sorrow
,
and
even
shed
many
tears
of
sorrow
,
and
again
,
when
they
:
thought
of
the
immediate
goodness
of
God
,
and
his
power
in
.
delivering
Alma
and
his
brethren
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
'and
of
bondage
,
they
did
raise
their
voices
,
and
give
thanks
to
God
.
And
again
,
when
they
thought
upon
the
Lamanites
,
who
were
their
bee
thien
,
of
their
sinful
and
polluted
state
,
they
were
filled
with
pain
and
anguish
,
for
the
welfare
of
their
souls
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
those
who
were
the
children
of
Amulon
.
and
his
brethren
,
who
had
taken
to
wife
the
daughters
of
the
Lamanites
,
were
displeased
with
the
conduct
of
their
fathers
,
and
they
would
no
longer
be
called
by
the
names
of
their
fathers
,
therefore
they
took
upon
themselves
the
name
of
Nephi
,
that
they
might
be
called
the
children
of
Nephi
,
and
be
numbered
among
those
who
were
called
Nephites
..
And
now
all
the
people
of
Zarahewila
were
numbered
with
the
Nephites
,
and
this
because
the
kingdom
had
been
conferred
upon
none
but
those
.
who
were
descendants
of
Nephi
.
And
now
it
came
.
to
-
pass
that
when
Mosiah
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
and
reading
tothe
people
,
he
desired
that
Alma
should
also
speak
to
the
people
,
.
And
:
Alma
did
speak
unto
them
,
when
they
were
assembled
together
in
large
bodies
,
and
he
went
from
one
body
to
another
,
preaching
unto
the
people
repentance
and
-
faith
on
the
Lord
.
And
he
did
exhort
the
people
of
Limhi
and
his
brethren
;
all
those
that
had
:
been
delivered
.
out
.
of
bondage
,
that
they
should
remember
that
it
was
the
Lord
that
did
.
deliver
them
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Alma
had
taught
.
the
people
many
things
,
and
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
to
them
,
that
:
king
Limhi
was
desirous
that
he
might
be
:
baptized
;..
and
al]
-
his
people
were
desirous
that
the
might
be
baptized
also
.
.
Therefore
Alma
did
go
forth
[File:220]
into
the
water
,
and
didbaptize
them
;.
yea
,:
he
did
baptize
them
after
the
manner
he
did
his
brethren
in
the
waters
of
Mormon
;
yea
,
and'
as
many
as
he
.
did
baptize
did
belong
to
the
church
of
God
;
and
this
because
of
their
belief
on
the
words
of
Alma
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Mosiah
granted
unto
Alma
,
that
he
might
establish
churches
throughout
all
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
and
gave
him
power
to
ordain
priests
and
teachers
over
every
church
.
Now
this
was
done
because
there
were
so
many
people
that
they
could
not
all
be
governed
by
one
teacher
;
neither
could
they
all
hear
the
word
of
God
in
one
assembly
;
therefore
they
did
assemble
themselves
together
in
different
bodies
,
being
called
churches
;
every
church
having
their
priests
and
their
teachers
,
and
every
priest
preaching
the
word
according
as
it
was
delivered
to
him
by
the
mouth
of
Alma
;
and
thus
,
notwithstanding
there
being
many
churches
,
they
were
all
one
chureh
;
yea
,
even
the
church
of
God
:
for
there
was
nothing
preached
in
all
the
churches
except
it
were
repentance
and
faith
in
God
.
And
now
there
were
seven
churches
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
were
desirous
to
take
upon
them
the
name
of
Christ
,
or
of
God
,
they
did
join
the
churches
of
God
:
and
they
were
called
.
the
people
of
God
.
And
the
Lord
did
pour
out
his
spirit
upon
them
,
and
they
were
blessed
,
and
prospered
in
the
land
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
of
the
.
rising'
generation
that
could
not
understand
the
words
of
king
Benjamin
,
being
Jittle
children
at
the
time
he
spzke
unto
his
people
;
and
they
did
not
believe
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
.
Phey
did
not
believe
what
had
been
said
concerning
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
;
neither
did
they
believe
concerning
.
the
coming
of
Christ
.
~
And
now
because
of
their
unbelief
,
they
could
not
understand
the
word
of
God
;
and\their
hearts
were
hardened
.
And
they
would
:
not'
be
baptized
;
neither
would
they
join'
the
church
.
:
And
:
they
were
a
separate
people'
as
to
their
faith
,
and
remained
so
ever
after
,
even
in
theircarnal
and
-
sinful
state
;
for
they
would
not'
callupon
the
Lord
:
their
God
.
And
now
in
the
reign
of
Mosiah
;
they
were
-
not
half
-
so
numerous
as
the
peopleof
God
;
but
because
of'
the
dissensions
among'
the'
brethren
,
theyâ
became
more
numer
:
dus
.
For
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
:
deceive
many
:
with'
their
flattering
words
,
who
-
were
imothe
charely
:
[File:221]
and
did
cause
them
to
commit
:
many
sins
;
therefore
it
became
expedient
that
those
who
committed
sin
that
were
inthe
church
,
should
be
admonished
by
the
church
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
brought
before
the
priests
,
and
delivered
up
unto
the
priests
by
the
teachers
;
and
the
priests
brought
them
before
Alia
,
who
was
the
high
priest
.
Now
.
king
Mosiah
had
given
Alma
the
authority
over
the
church
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
did
not
know
concerning
them
,
for
there
were
many
witnesses
against
them
;
yea
,
the
peo
le
stood
and
testified
of
their
iniquity
in
abundance
.
Now
there
had
not
any
such
thing
happened
before
,
in
the
church
;
therefore
Alma
was
troubled
in
his
spirit
,
and
he
caused
that
they
should
be
brought
before
the
king
.
And
he
said
unto
the
king
,
behold
,
here
are
many
whom
we
have
brought
before
thee
,
who
are
accused
of
their
brethren
;
yea
,
and
they
have
been
taken
-
in
divers
iniquities
,
And
they
do
not
repent
of
their
iniquities
;
therefore
we
have
brought
them
before
thee
,
that
thou
mayest
judge
them
according
to
their
crimes
.
But
king
Mosiah
gaid
unto
Alma
,
behold
,
I
judge
them
not
;
therefore
I
deliver'them
into
thy
hands
to
be
judged
.
And
now
the
spirit
of
Alma
was
again
troubled
;
and
he
went
and
inquired
of
the
Lord
what
he
should
do
concerning
this
matter
,
~~
ar
feared
that
he
should
do
wrong
in
the
sight
of
od
,
;
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
he
had
poured
out
his
whole
soul
to
God
,
the
voice
of
the
Lord
came
to
him
,
saying
,
blessed
art
thou
,
Alma
,
and
blessed
are
they
who
were'
baptized
in
the
waters
of
Mormon
.
Thou
art
blessed
because
of
thy
exceeding
faith
in
the
words
alone
of
my
servant
Abinadi
.
And
blessed
are
they
,
because
of
their
exceeding
faith
in
the
words
alone
which
thou
hast
spoken
unto
them
.
And
blessed
art
thou
because
thou
hast
established
a
church
among
this
people
;
and
they
shall
be
established
,
and
they
shall
be
my
people
,
Yea
,
blessed
is
this'
people
,
who
are
willing
to
bear
my
name
:
for
in
my
name
shall
they
becalled
;
and
they
are'
mine
.
Â©
And
because
thou
hast
enquired
of
me
concerning
the
transgressor
,
thou
art
blessed
:
Thou
art
my
servant
:
and
I'
covenant
with
thee
,
that
thou
shalt
have
eternal
life
;
and
-
thou
ghalt
serve
me
,
and
go
forth
in
my
name
,
and
shall
gather
together
my
sheep
.
.
And
he
that
will
hear
my
yoice
,
shall
be
my
sheep
;
and
him
shall'ye'receive
in
[File:222]
to
the
church
;
and
him
will
I
also
receive
.
For
behold
,
this
.
is
my
church
:
whosoever
is
baptized
,
shall
be
baptized
unto
repentance
,.
And
whosoever
ye
receive
,
shall
believe
in
my
name
;
and
him
will
I
freely
forgive
:
for
it
is
I
that
taketh
upon
me
the
sins
of
the
world
;
for
it
is
I
that
hath
created
them
;
and
it
is
I
that
granteth
unto
him
that
believeth
in
the
end
,
a
place
at
my
right
hand
.
.
For
behold
,
in
my
name
are
they
called
;
and
if
they
know
me
,
they
shall
come
forth
,
and
shall
have
a
place
eternally
at
my
right
hand
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
the
second
trump
shall
sound
,
then
shall
they
that
never
knew
me
come
forth
,
and
shall
stand
before
me
;
and
then
shall
they
know
that
Iam
the
Lord
their
God
,
that
I
am
their
Redeemer
;
but
they
would
not
be
redeemed
.
And
then
will
I
confess
unto
them
,
that
I
never
knew
them
;
and
they
shall
depart
into
everlasting
fire
,
prepared
for
the
devil
and
his
angels
.
Therefore
I
say
unto
you
,
that
he
that
will
not
hear
my
voice
,
the
same
shall
ye
not
receive
into
my
church
,
for
him
I
will
not
receive
at
the
last
day
;
therefore
I
say
unto
you
,
go
;
and
whosoever
transgresseth
against
me
,
him
shall
ye
judge
according
to
the
sins
which
he
has
committed
;
and
if
he
confess
his
-
sins
before
thee
and
me
,
and
repenteth
in
the
sincerity
of
his
heart
,
him
shall
ye
forgive
,
and
I
will
forgive
him
also
;
yea
,
and
as
often
as
my
peoplerepent
,
willl
forgive
them
their
trespasses
against
me
.
And
ye
shall
also
forgive
one
another
your
trespasses
:
for
verily
I
say
unto
you
,
he
that
forgiveth
not
hisneighbor's
trespasses
,
when
he
says
that
he
repents
,
the
same
hath
brought
himself
under
condemnation
.
Now
I
say
unto
you
,
go
;
and
whosoever
will
not
repent
of
his
sins
,
the
same
shall
not
be
numbered
among
my
people
:
and
this
shall
be
observed
from
this
time
forward
.
And
it
came
to
pass
when
Alma
had
heard
these
words
,
he
wrote
them
down
,
that
.
he
might
have
them
,
and
that
he
might
judge
the
people
of
that
church
,
according
to
the
commandments
of
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
went
and
judged
those
that
had
been
:
taken
in
iniquity
,
according
to
the
word
of
the
Lord
.
And
whosoever
repented
of
their
sins
and
did
confess
them
,
them
he
did
number
among
the
people
of
the
church
;
and
.
those
that
would
not
confess
their
sins
and
repent
.
of
their
iniquity
,
the
same
were
not
numbered
among
the
people
of
.
the
church
,
and
their
names
were
:
blotted
out
.
aa
it
came
to
pass
[File:223]
that
Alma
did
regulate
all
the
affairs
of
the
church
;
and
they
began
again
to
have
peace
and
to
prosper
exceedingly
in
the
affairs
of
the
church
;
walking
circumspectly
before
God
;
receiving
many
,
and
baptizing
many
.
And
now
all
these
things
did
Alma
and
his
fellow
-
laborers
do
,
who
were
over
the
church
;
ee
in
all
diligence
;
teaching
the
word
of
God
in
al
things
;
suffering
all
manner
of
afflictions
;
being
persecuted
by
all
those
who
did
not
belong
to
the
church
of
Ged
.
And
they
did
admonish
their
brethren
;
and
they
were
also
admonished
,
every
one
,
by
the
word
of
God
,
according
to
his
sins
,
or
to
.
the
sins
which
he
had
committed
;
being
commanded
of
God
to
pray
without
ceasing
,
and
to
give
thanks
in
all
things
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
persecutions
which
were
inflicted
on
thechurch
by
the
unbelievers
,
became
so
great
,
that
the
church
began
to
murmur
,
and
complain
to
their
leaders
concerning
the
matter
;
and
they
did
complain
to
Alma
.
And
Alma
laid
the
case
before
their
king
,
Mosiah
.
And
Mosiah
consulted
with
his
priests
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Mosiah
sent
a
proclamation
throughout
the
land
.
round
about
,
that
there
should
not
any
unbeliever
persecute
any
of
those
who
belonged
to
the
church
of
God
;
and
there
was
a
strict
command
throughout
all
the
churches
,
that
there
should
be
no
.
persecutions
among
them
;
that
there
should
be
an
equality
among
all
men
;
that
they
should
Jet
no
pride
nor
haughtiness
disturb
their
peace
;
that
every
man
should
esteem
his
neighbor
as
himself
,
laboring
with
their
own
hands
for
their
support
;
yea
,
and
all
their
priests
and
teachers
should
labor
with
their
own
hands
for
their
support
,
in
all
cases
save
it
were
in
sickness
,
or
in
much
want
:
and
doing
these
things
,
they
did
abound
in
the
grace
of
God
.
And
there
began
to
be
much
peace
again
in
the
land
;
and
the
people
began
to
be
very
numerous
,
and
began
to
scatter
abroad
.
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
;
yea
,
on
the
north
and
on
the
south
,
on
the
east
and
on
the
west
,
building
large
cities
and
villages
in
all
quarters
of
the
land
.
And
the
Lord
did
visit
them
and
.
prosper
them
,
and
they
became
a
large
and
a
wealthy
people
.
ow
the
sons
of
Mosiah
were
numbered
among
the
unbelievers
;
and
also
one
of
the
sons
of
Alma
.
was
numbered
among
them
,
he
being
called
Alma
,
after
his
father
;
nevertheless
he
became
a
very
wicked
and
an
.
idolatrous
.
man
.
And
he
was
a
,
man
ofmany
words
,
and
did
speak
much
.
flattery
.
to
.
the
people
;
[File:224]
therefore
he
led
many
of
the
people
to
-
do
after
the
manner
of
his
iniquities
.
And
he
became
.
a
great
hinderment
to
the
prosperity
of
the
church
of
God
:
stealing
away
the
hearts
of
the
people
;
causing
much
dissension
among
the
people
;
giving
a
chance
for
the
enemy
of
God
to
exereise
his
power
over
them
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
while
he
was
going
about
to
destroy
the
church
of
God
:
for
he
did
go
about
seeretly
with
the
sons
of
Mosiah
,
seeking
to
destroy
the
church
,
and
to
lead
astray
the
people
of
the
Lord
,
contrary
to
the
commandments
of
God
,
or
even
the
king
;
and
as
I
said
unto
you
,
as
they
were
going
about
rebelling
against
God
,
behold
,
the
angel
of
the
Lord
appeared
unto
them
;
and
he
descended
as
it
were
in
a
cloud
;
and
he
spake
as
it
were
with
a
voice'of
thunder
,
which
caused
the
earth
to
shake
up6n
which
they
stood
;
-
and
so
great
was
their
astonishment
,
that
they
fell
to
the
earth
,
and
understood'
not
the
words
which
he
spake
unto
them
.
Nevertheless
he
cried
again
,
saying
,
Alma
,
arise
,
and
stand
forth
,
for
why
persecuteth
thou
the
church
-
of
God
?
For
the
Lord
hath
said
,
This
is
my
chureh
,
and
I
will
establish
it
;
and
nothing
shall
overthrow
it
,
save
it
is
the
transgression
of
my
people
.
And
again
,
the
angel
said
behold
,
the
Lord
hath
heard
the
prayers
of
his
people
,
and
also
the
prayers
of
his
servant
Alma
,
who
is
thy
father
:
for
he
has
prayed
with
much
faith
concerning
thee
,
that
thou
mightest
be
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
;
therefore
for
this
purpose
have
I
come
to
convince
thee
of
the
power
and
authority
of
God
,
that
the
prayers
of
his
servants
might
be
answered
according
to
their
faith
.
And
now
behold
,
can
ye
dispute
the
power
of
Godt
For
behold
,
doth
not
my
voice
shake
the
earth
?
And
can
ye
not
also
behold
me
before
you
?
And
Lam
sent
from
God
,
Now
I
say
unto
thee
,
go
,
and
remember
the
captivity
of
thy
fathers
in
the
land
of
Helam
,
and
in
the
land
of
Nephi
;
and
remember
how
great
things
he
has
done
for
them
:
for
they
were
in
bondage
,
and
he
has
deliveredthem
.
And
now
I
say
unto
thee
,
Alma
,
go
thy
way
,
and
seek
to
destroy
the
church
no
more
,
that
their
prayers
may
be
annem
eros
and
this
even
if
thou
wilt
of
thyself
be
cast
off
.
;
And
now
it
came
to'
pass
that
these
were
the
last
words
which
the
.
angel
spake
unto
Alma
,
and
he
de
rted
.
And
now
Alma
,
and
those'
that
were
with
im
,
fellagain
to'the
earth
;
for
great
was
their
:
aston
[File:225]
ishment
:
for
with
their
own
eyes
:
they
had
beheld
an
angel
of
the
Lord
;
and
his
voice
was
as
thunder
,
which
shook
the
earth
;
and
they
knew
that
there
was
nothing
save
the
power
of
God
,
that
could
shake
the
earth
and
cause
it
o
tremble
,
as
though
it
would
part
asunder
.
.
And
now
the
astonishment
of
Alma
was
so
great
,
that
he
became
dumb
,
that
he
could
not
open
his
meuth
;
yea
,
and
he
became
weak
,
even
that
-
he
could
not
move
his
hands
:
therefore
he
was
taken
by
those
that
were
with
him
,
and
carried
helpless
,
even
until
he
was
laid
before
his
father
.
And
they
rehearsed
unto
his
father
all
that
had
happened
.
unto
them
;
and
his
father
rejoiced
,
for
he
knew
that
it
was
the
power
of
God
.
And
he
caused
that
a
multitude
should
be
gathered
together
,
that
they
might
witness
what
the
Lord
had
done
for
his
son
,
and
also
for
those
that
were
withhim
.
And
he
caused
that
the
priests
should
assemble
themselves
together
;
and
they
began
to
fast
;
and
to
pray
to
the
Lord
their
God
,
that
he
would
open
the
mouth
of
Alma
,
that
he
might
speak
;
and
also
that
his
limbs
might
receive
their
strength
,
that
the
eyes
of
the
people
might
be
opened
to
see
and
know
of
the
goodness
and
glory
of
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
after
they
had
fasted
and
prayed
for
the
space
of
two
days
and
twovnights
,
the
limbs
of
Alma
received
their
.
strength
,
and
he
stood
up
and
beganto
speak
unto
them
,
bidding
them
to
be
of
good
comfort
;
for
,
said
he
,
I
have
repented
of
my
sins
,
and
have
been
redeemed
of
the
Lord
;:
behold
,
I
am
born
of
the
spirit
.
And
the
Lord
said
unto
me
,:
marvel
not
that
all
mankind
,
yea
,
men
,
and
women
,
all
nations
,
kindreds
,
tongues
and
people
,
must
be
born
again
;
yea
,,
born'of
God
,
changed'
from
their
carnal
and
fallen
state
,
to'a
state
of
righteousness
,
being
redeemed
of
God
;-
becoming
his
sons
and
daughters
;
and
thus
they
:
become
new
creatures
;
and
unless
they
do
this
,
they
can'inno
-
wise
inherit
the
kingdom
of
God
.
-
I
say
un+
to'you
,
unless
this
be
the
case
,
they
must
be
cast
off
:
and
this
I
know
,
because
I
was
like
10
be
cast
off
:
Nevertheless
,
after
.
wandering
through
much
tribulation
,
repenting
nigh
unto
death
,
the
Lord
in
mercy
hath
seen
fit
:
to
snatch
me
-
out
of
an
everlasting
burning
,
and
I
am
born
of
God
;
my
soul
hath
been
redeemed
from
the
gall
of
bitterness
and
bonds
of
iniquity
.
I
was
in
the
darkest
abyss
;
butnow']
behold
the
marvelous
light
of
God
.
My
soul
waswrecked
with
eternal
torment
;
butIam
snatched
,
and
my
soul
ig'
pained'no
mores
I'rejected
my
Redeemer
,
and
:
denied
[File:226]
that
which
had
been
spoken
of
by
our
fathers
;
but
own
that
they
may
foresee
and
that
he
will
come
,
and
that
he
remembereth
every
creature
of
his
creating
,
he
will
make
hiinself
manifest
unto
all
;
yea
,
every
knee
shall
bow
,
and
every
tongue
confess
before
him
.
Yea
,
even
at
the
last
day
,
when
all
men
shall
stand
to
be
judged
of
him
,
then
shall
they
confess
that
he
is
God
;
then
shall
they
confess
,
who
live
without
God
in
the
world
,
that
the
judgment
of
an
everlesting
punishment
is
just
upon
:
them
;
and
they
shall
quake
,
and
tremble
,
and
shrink
beneath
the
glance
of
his
all
-
searching
eye
.
And
now
it
came'to
pass
that
Alma
began
from
this
time
forward
,
to
teach
the
people
,
and
those
who
were
with
Alma
-
at
the
time
the
angel
appeared
unto
them
;
travelling
round
about
through
all
the
land
,
publishing
to
all
the'people
the
things
.
which
they
had
heard
and
seen
,
and
preaching
the
word
of
Godin
much
tcibulation
,
being
greatly
persecuted
by
those
who
were
unbelievers
,
being
smitten
by
many
of
them
;
but
notwithstanding
all
this
,
they
did
impart
much
consolation
to
the
church
,
confirming
their
faith
,
and
exhorting
them
with
long
suffering
and
much
travail
,
to
keep
the
commandments
of
God
.
And
four
of
them
were
the
sons
of
Mosiah
;
and
their
names
were
Ammon
,
and
Aaron
,
and
Omner
,
and
Himni
:
these
were
the
names
of
the
sons
of
Mosiah
,
And
they
travelled
throughout
all
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
among
all
the
people
who
were
under
.
the
reign
of
king
Mosiah
,
zealously
striving
to
repair
all
the
injuries
which
they
had
done
to
the
church
;
confessing
all
their
sins
,
and
publishing
all
the
things
which
they
had
seen
,
and
explaining
the
prophecies
and
the
scriptures
to
all
who
desired
to
hear
them
:
and
thus
they
were
instruments
in
the
hands
of
God
,
in
bringing
many
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
,
yea
,
to
the
knowledge
of
their
Redeemer
.
And
how
blessed
are
they
!
For
they
did
publish
peace
;
they
did
publish
good
tidings
of
good
;
and
they
.
did
deelare
unto
the
people
that
the
Lord
reigneth

CHAPTER
XII
.
Â©
Now
itcame
to
that
after
the
sons
of
Mosiah
bad
done
all
these
things
,
they
:
took
s
:
small
number
[File:227]
with
them
,
and
returned
to
their
father
,
the
king
,
and
desired
of
him
that
he
would
grant
unto
them
,
that
~
they
might
,
with
these
whom
they
had
selected
,
go
up
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
that
they
might
preach
the
things
.
which
they
had
heard
,
and
that
they
might
impart
the
word
of
God
to
their
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
,
that
perhaps
they
might
bring
them
to
the
knowledge
of
the
Lord
their
God
,
and
convince
them
of
the
iniquity
of
their
fathers
;
and
that
perhaps
they
might
cure
them
of
their
hatred
towards
the
Nephites
,
that
they
.
'
might
also
be
brought
to
rejoice
in
the
Lord
their
God
,
that
they
might
become
friendly
to
one
another
,
and
that
there
shouldbe
no
more
contentions
in
all
the
land
which
the
Lord
their
God
had
given
them
.
Now
they
were
desirous
that
salvation
should
be
declared
to
every
creature
,
for
they
could
not
bear
that
any
human
soul
should
perish
;
yea
,
even
the
very
thoughts
that
any
soul
should
endure
endless
torment
,
did
cause
them
to
quake
and
tremble
.
And
thus
-
did
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
work
upon
them
,
for
they
were
the
very
vilest
of
sinners
.
-
And
the
Lord
saw
fit
in
his
infinite
mercy
to
spare
them
;
nevertheless
they
suffered
much
anguish
of
soul
,
because
of
their
iniquities
;
and
suffering
much
,
fearing
that
they
should
be
cast
off
forever
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
plead
with
their
father
many
days
,
that
they
might
go
up
to
the
land
of
Nephi
.
And
king
Mosiah
went
and
inquired
of
the
Lord
,
if
he
would
let
his
sons
go
up
among
the
Lamanites
to
preach
the
word
.
And
the
Lord
said
unto
Mosiah
,
let
them
go
up
,
for
many
sha]l
believe
on
their
words
,
and
they
shall
have
eternal
life
;
and
I
will
deliver
thy
sons
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Mosiah
granted
that
they
might
go
,
and
do
according
to
their
request
;,
and
they
took
their
journey
into
the
wilderness
,
to
go
up
to
preach
the
word
among
the
Lamanites
:
and
I
shall
ge
an
account
of
their
proceedings
hereafter
.
Now
ing
Mosiah
had
no
one
to
confer
the
kingdom
upon
,
for
there
was
not
any
of
his
sons
who
would
accept
of
the
kingdom
;
therefore
he
took
the
records
which
were
i
ioe
on
the
plates
.
of
brass
,
and
also
the'
plates
of
Nephi
,
and
all
the
things
which
he
had
kept
and
preserved
,
according
to
the
commandments
of
God
,
after
having'
tenslated
and
caused
to
be
written
the
records
which
were
:
on
the
plates
of
gold
,
which
had
been
fouud'
bythe
people
of
Limhi
,;
which
were
?
[File:228]
delivered
to
him
.
by
the
handjof
Limhi
:
and
this
:
he
did
,
because
of
the
great
anxiety
of
his
people
,
for
they
.
were
desirous
beyond
measure
,
to
know
concerning
those
people
who
had
been
destroyed
.
And
now
he
translated
them
by
the
means
of
those
two
stones
which
were
fastened
into
the
two
rims
of
a
bow
.
Now
these
things
were
prepared
from
the
beginning
,
and
were
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
,
for
the
purpose
of
interpreting
languages
;
and
the
have
been
kept
and
preserved
by
the
band
of
the
Lord
,
that
he
should
discover
to
every
creature
who
should
possess
the
land
,
the
iniquities
and
abominations
of
his
people
:
and
whosoever
has
these
things
,
is
called
seer
,
after
the
manner
of
old
times
.
Now
after
Mosiah
had
finished
translating
these
records
,
behold
,
it
gave
an
account
of
the
people
who
were
destroyed
,
from
the
time
that
they
were
destroyed
,
back
to
the
building
of
the
great
tower
,
at
the
time
the
Lord
confounded
the
language
of
the
people
;
and
they
were
scattered
abroad
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
,
yea
,
and
even
from
that
time
until
the
creation
of
Adam
.
Now
this
account
did
cause
the
people
of
Mosiah
to
mourn
exceedingly
;
yea
,
they
were
filled
with
sorrow
:
nevertheless
it
gave
them
much
knowledge
,
in
the
which
they
did
rejoice
.
And
this
account
shall
be
written
hereaiter
:
for
behold
,
'
it
.
is
expedient
that
all
people
should
know
the
things
which
are
written
in
this
account

CHAPTER
XU
Anp
now
,
as
I
saidunto
you
,
that
after
king
Mosiah
had
done
.
these'
things
,
he
took
the
plates
of
.
brass
,
and
all
the
things
.
which
he
had
kept
,
and
conferred
them
upon
Alma
;
who
was
the
son
.
of
Alma
;-
yea
,
all
the
records
,
and
also
the
interpreters
,
and
:
conferred
them
upon
him
,
and
commanded
him
:
that
:
he
should
keep
and
preserve
them
;
and
also
keep
.
a
record
of
-
the
.
people
,
handing
them
.
down
/front
one
generation
:
to
,
another
,
even
asithey
-
had
been
Jianded
down
from
the
time'
that

Now
when
:
Mosiah
:
Jhad
:
done
this
,
hesent
out
throughout
:
all
the
land
;
among
-
all
:
the
people
;
desiring
toknow

their
will

(
I
[File:229]
cerning
who
should
be
their
king
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
people
came
,
saying
,
we
are
desirous
that
Aaron
,
thy
son
,
should
be
our
king
,
and
our
ruler
.
Now
Aaron
had
gone
up
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
therefore
the
king
could
not
confer
the
kingdom
upon
him
;
neither
would
Aaron
take
upon
-
him
the
kingdom
;
neither
were
any
of
the
sons
of
Mosiah
willing
to
take
upon
them
the
kingdom
,
therefore
king
Mosiah
sent
againamong
the
people
,
yea
,
even
a
written
word
sent
he
among
the
people
.
And
these
were
the
words
:
that
were
written
;
saying
:
Behold
,
Oye
my
people
,
or
my
brethren
,
for
]
esteem
you
as
such
;
for
I
desire
that
ye
should
consider
the
cause
which
ye
are
called
te
consider
;
for
ye
are
desirous
to
have
a
ing
.
Now
I
declare
unto
you
,
that
be
to
whom
the
kingdom
doth
rightly
belong
,
has
declined
,
and
will
not
take
upoa
him
the
kingdom
.
And
now
if
there
should
be
another
appointed
in
his
stead
,
behold
I
fear
there
would
rise
contentions
among
you
;
and
who
knoweth
but
what
my
son
,
fo
whom
the
kingdom
doth
belong
,
should
tura
to
be
angry
,
and
draw
away'a
part
of
this
people
afier
him
,
which
would
cause
wars
and
contentions
among
you
;
which
would
be
the
cause
of
shedding
much
blood
,
and
perverting
the
way
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
and
destroy
the
souls
of
many
people
.
Now
I
say
unto
you
,
let
us
be
wise
and
consider
these
things
,
for
we
have
no
right
to
destroy
-
my
son
,
neither
should
we
have
any
right
to
destroy
another
,
if
he
should
be
appointed
in
his
stead
.
And
if
my
son
should
turn
agaii
to
his
pride
and
vain
things
,
he
would
recall
the
things
which
he
had
said
,
and
claim
his
right
to
the
kingdom
,
which
would
cause
him
and
also
this
people
to
commit
much
sin
.
And
now
let
us
.
be
wise
and
look
forward
to
these
things
,
and
do
:
that
which
will
make
for
the
peace
of
this
people
.
Therefore
I
will
be
your
king
the
remainder
of
my
days
;
nevertheless
,
let
_us
appoint
judges
,
to
judge
this
people
according
to
our
law
,
and
we
will
newly
arrange
the
affairs
of
this
people
,
for
we
will
appoint
wise
men
to
be
judges
,
that
will
judge
this
people
according
to
the
commandments
of
bod
.
Now
it
is
better
thata
man
should
be
judged
of
God
than
of
man
,
forthe
judgments
of
God
are
always
just
,
but
the
judgments
of
man
are
not
always
just
;
therefore
,
if
it
were
possible
that
ye
could
have
just'
men
:
to
be
your
kings
,
who
would
establish
the
laws
of
God
,
and
judge'this
people
according
to
his
commandments
;
yea
,
if
ye
[File:230]
could
have
men
for
your
kings
,
who
would
do
even
as
my
father
Benjamin
did
for
this
people
;
I
say
unto
you
,
if
this
could
always
be
the
case
,
then
it
would
be
expedient
that
ye
should
always
have
kings
to
rule
over
you
.
And
even
I
,
myself
have
labored
with
all
the
power
of
faculties
which
I
have
possessed
,
to
teach
you
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
to
establish
peace
throughout
the
land
,
that
there
should
be
no
wars
nor
contentions
,
no
stealing
,
nor
plundering
,
nor
murdering
,
nor
any
manner
of
iniquity
:
and
whosoever
has
committed
iniquity
,
him
have
I
punished
according
to
the
law
which
has
been
given
to
us
by
our
fathers
.
Now
I
say
unto
you
,
that
because
all
men
are
not
just
,
it
is
net
expedient
that
ye
should
have
a
king
or
kings
to
rule
over
you
.
For
behold
,
how
much
iniquity
doth
one
wicked
king
cause
to
be
committed
!
ea
,
and
what
great
destruction
!
Yea
,
remember
ing
Noah
,
his
wickedness
and
his
abominations
;
and
also
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
his
people
,
Behold
what
great
destruction
did
come
upon
them
;
and
also
because
of
their
iniquities
,
they
were
brought
into
bondage
.
And
were
it
not
for
the
interposition
of
their
all
-
wise
Creator
,
and
this
because
of
their
sincere
repentance
,
they
must
unavoidably
remained
in
bondage
until
now
.
But
behold
,
he
did
deliver
them
because
they
did
humble
themselves
before
him
;
and
because
they
cried
mightily
unto
him
,
he
did
deliver
them
out
of
bondage
:
and
thus
doth
the
Lord
work
with
his
power
in
all
cases
among
the
children
of
men
,
extending
the
arm
of
mercy
towards
them
that
put
their
trust
.
in
him
.
.
And
behold
,
now
I
say
unto
you
,
ye
cannot
dethrone
an
iniquitous
king
,
save
it
be
through
much
contention
,
and
the
shedding
of
much
blood
.
For
behold
,
he
has
his
friends
in
iniquity
,
and
he
keepeth
his
guards
about
him
;
and
he
teareth
up
the
laws
of
those
who
have
reigned
in
righteousness
before
him
:
and
he
trampeleth
under
his
feet
the
commandments
of
God
;
and
he
enacteth
laws
,
and
sendeth
them
forth
among
his
people
;
yea
,
laws
after
the
manner
of
his
own
wickedness
;
and
whosoever
doth
not
obey
his
laws
,
he
causeth
to
be
destroyed
;
and
whosoever
doth
rebel
against
him
,
he
will
send
his
armies
against
them
to
war
,
aud
if
he
can
,
he
will
.
destroy
them
:
and
thus
an
unrighteous
king
doth
pervert
the
ways
of
all
righteousness
...
And
now
behold
I
say
unto
you
,
it
is
not
.
expedient
that
such
abominations
should
come
.
upon
you
;,
therefore
choose
you
by
the
[File:231]
yoice
of
this
people
,
judges
,
that
..
ye
may
be
judged
according
to
the
laws
which
.
have
been
given
you
by
our
fathers
,
which
are
correct
,
and
which
were
.
given
them
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
:
Now
it
is
not
common
.
that
the
voice
of
the
.
people
desireth
any
thing
contrary
to
that
which
is
mght
;
but
itis
cowmon
for
the
lesser
part
of
the
people
to
desire
that
which
is
not
right
;
therefore
this
shall
ye
observe
,
and
,
make
it
your
law
to
do
your
business
by
the
voice
of
the
people
.
And
if
the
time
comes
that
the
voice
of
the
people
doth
choose
iniquity
,
then
is
the
time
that
the
judgments
of
God
will
come
upon
you
;
yea
,
then
is
the
time
he
will
visit
you
with
great
destruction
,
even
as
he
-
has
hitherto
visited
this
land
.
Atd
now
if
ye
have
.
judges
,
and
they
do
not
judge
you
according
to
the
law
which
has
been
given
,
ye
can
-
cause
that
they
may
be
judged
of
a
.
higher
judge
;
if
-
your
higher
judges
do
not
judge
righteous
judgments
,
ye
shall
cause
that
a
smail
number
of
your
lower
judges
should
.
be
gathered
together
,
and
they
.
shall
judge
your
higher
judges
,
accordiny
to
the
voice
of
the
people
.
And
I
command
you
to
do
these
things
in
the
fear
of
the
Lord
;
and
I
command
you
to
do
these
things
,
and
that
ye
have
no
king
:
that
if
these
people
commit
sins
and
iniquities
,
they
shal]
be
answered
upon
their
own
heads
.
For
behold
I
say
unto
you
,
the
sins
of
many
people
have
been
.
caused
.
by
the
iniquities
of
their
kings
;
therefore
their
iniquities
are
answered
upon
the
heads
of
their
kings
.
And
now
I
desire
that
thig
inequality
should
.
be
no
more
in
this
land
,.
especially
among
this
my
people
;
but
I
desire
that
this
land
be
a
:
Jand
of
liberty
,
and
every
man
may
enjoy
his
rights
.
and
privileges
alike
,
so
long
as
the
Lord
sees
fit
,
thatâ
we
may
live
and
inherit
the
land
;
yea
,
even
as
Jong
as
any
of
our
posterity
remains
upon
the
face
of
the
Jand
..
And
many
more
things
did
king
Mosiah
write
unto
them
,
unfolding
unto
.
them
all
the
trials
and
troubles
of
a
righteous
king
:
yea
,
all
the
travails
of
soul
for
their
people
,
and
also
all
the
murmurings
of
the
people
to
their
king
;
and
he
explained
it
all
unto
them
.
And
he
told
them
that
these
things
ought
not
to
be
:
but
that
the
burden
should
come
upon
all
the
people
,
that
every
.
man
.
might
bear
his
part
.
And
he
also
unfolded
unto
them
.
all
the
disadvantages
they
labored
under
,
by
having
an
unrighteous
king
to
rule
over
them
;
yea
,
all
-
his
iniquities
and
.
abominations
,
[File:232]
and
all
the
wars
,
and
contentions
,
and
bloodshed
,
and
the
stealing
,
and
the
plundering
,
and
the
committing
of
whoredoms
,
and
all
manner
of
iniquities
,
which
cannot
be
enumerated
;
telling
them
that
these
things
ought
not
to
be
;
that
they
were
expressly
repugnant
to
the
commandments
of
God
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
,
after
king
Mosiah
had
sent
these
things
forth
among
the
people
,
they
were
convinced
of
the
truth
of
his
words
;
therefore
they
relinquished
their
desires
for
a
king
,
and
became
exceedingly
anxious
that
every
man
should
have
an
equal
chance
throughout
all
the
land
;
yea
,
and
every
man
expressed
a
willingness
to
answer
for
his
own
sins
.
Therefore
it
came
to
pass
that
they
assembled
themselves
together
in
bodies
throughout
the
land
,
to
cast
in
their
voices
concerning
who
should
be
their
judges
,
to
judge
them
according
to
the
law
which
had
en
given
them
;
and
they
were
exceedingly
rejoiced
,
because
of
the
liberty
which
had
been
granted
unto
them
.
And
they
did
wax
strong
in
love
towards
Mosiah
;
yea
,
they
did
esteem
him
more
than
any
other
man
:
for
they
did
not
look
upon
him
as
a
tyrant
,
who
was
seeking
for
gain
,
yea
,
for
that
lucre
which
:
doth
corrupt
the
soul
,
for
he
had
not
exacted
riches
of
them
,
neither
had
he
delighted
in
the
shedding
of
blood
;
but
he
had
established
peace
in
the
land
,
and
he
had
granted
unto
his
people
that
they
should
be
delivered
from
all
manner
of
bondage
;
therefore
they
did
esteem
him
,
yea
,
exceedingly
,
beyond
measure
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
appoint
judges
to
rule
over
them
,
or
to
judge
them
according
to
the
law
;
and
this
they
did
throughout
all
the
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
was
appointed
to
be
the
first
chief
judge
;
he
being
also
the
high
priest
;
his
father
having
conferred
the
office
upon
him
,
and
had
given
him
the
charge
concerning
all
the
affairs
of
the
church
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
did
walk
in
the
ways
of
the
Lord
,
and
he
did
keep
his
commandments
,
and
he
did
judge
righteons
judgments
;
and
there
was
continual
peace
through
the
land
;
and
thus
commenced
the
reign
of
the
judges
throughout
all
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
among
all
the
people
who
were
called
the
Nephites
:
and
Alma
was
the
first
and
chief
judge
.
And
now
it
came
to'
pass
that
his
father
ied
:
being
eighty
and
two
years
:
old
,
having
lived
to
fulfil
the
commandments
of
God
.
[File:233]
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Mosiah
.
died
also
,
in
the
thirty
and
third
year
of
his
reign
,
being
sixty
.
and
three
years
old
;
making
in
the
whole
,
five
hundred
and
nine
years
from
the
time
Lehi
left
Jerusalem
;
and
thus
ended
the
reign
of
the
kings
over
the
people
:
of
Nephi
;
and
thus
ended
the
days
of
Alma
,
who
wad
the
founder
of
their
church

Now
it
came
to

that
in
the
first
.
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
from
this
time
forward
,
king
Mosiah
having
gone
the
way
of
all

earth
,
having
warred'a
good
warfare
,
walking
uprightly
before
God
,
ae
none
to
reign
in
his
stead
;
nevertheless
he
established
laws
,
and
.
they
were
acknowledged
by
the
people
;
therefore
they
were
obliged
to
abide
by
the
laws
which
he
had
made
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of
Alma
in
the
judgment
seat
,
there
was
a
man
brought
before

,
and
was
noted
.
for
his
much
strength
;
and
he
had'
gone
about
among
the
people
,
-
preaching
to
.
them
that
which
he
:
termed
to
be
the
word
of
God
,
bearing
down
against
the
church
;
declaring
unto
the
people
that
every
priest
and
teacher
ought
to
become
popular
;
and
they
ought
not
to
labor
with
their
hands
,
but
that
they
-
ought
to
besupported
by
the
people
;
and
he
also
testified
unto
the
people
that
all
mankind
should
be
saved
at
the
last
:
day
,
and
-
that
they
need
[File:234]
not
fear
nor
tremble
,
but
that
they
.
might
lift
up
.
their
heads
and
rejoice
:
for
the
Lord
had
created
all
men
,
and
had
also
redeemed
all
men
;
and
inthe
end
,
all
men
should
have
eternal
life
.
And
-
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
teach
these
things
so
much
,
that
-
many
did
believe
on
his
words
,
even
so
many
that
they
began
to
support
him
and
give
him
money
;
and
.
he
began
to
be
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
his
heart
,
and
to
wear
very
costly
apparel
;
yea
,
and
even
began
to
establish
a
church
,
after
the
manner
of
his
preaching
,
And
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
going
to
preach
to
those
who
believed
on
his
word
,
he
met
a
man
who
belonged
to
the
church
of
God
,
yea
,
even
one
of
their
teachers
;
and
he
began
to
contend
with
him
sharply
,
that
he
might
lead
away
the
people
of
the
church
;
but
the
man
withstood
him
,
admonishing
him
with
the
words
of
God
.
Now
the
name
of
the
man
was
Gideon
;
and
it
was
he
who
was
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
God
,
in
delivering
the
peoole
of
Limhi
out
of
bondage
.
Now
because
Gideon
withstood
him
with
the
words
of
God
,
he
was
wroth
with
Gideon
,
and
drew
his
sword
and
began
to
smite
him
..
Now
Gideon
being
stricken
with
many
years
therefore
he
was
not
able
to
withstand
his
blows
,
therefore
he
was
slain
by
the
sword
;
and
the
man
who
slew
him
was
taken
by
the
people
of
the
church
,
and
was
brought
.
before
Alma
,
to
be
judged
according
to
the
crime
which
he
had
committed
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
stood
before
Alma
,
and
plead
for
himself
with
much
boldness
.
But
Alma
said
unto
him
,
behold
,
this
is
the
first
time
that
priestcraft
has
been
introduced
among
this
people
.
And
behold
,
thou
art
not
only
guilty
of
priestcraft
,
but
hast
endeavored
to
enforce
it
by
the
sword
;
and
were
priestcraft
to
be
enforced
among
this
people
,
it
would
prove
their
entire
destruction
.
And
thou
hast
shed
the
blood
of
a
righteous
man
,
yea
,
a
man
who
has
done
much
good
among
this
people
;
and
were
we
to
spare
thee
,
his
blood
would
come
upon
-
us
for
vengeance
;
therefore
thou
art
condemned
to
:
die
,
according
to
the
law
which
has
been
given
us
by
,
Mosiah
,
our
last
king
;
and
they
have
been
acknowledged
by
this
people
;
therefore
this
people
must
.
abide
by
the
law
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
him
;:
and
his
name
was
Nehor
;
and
they
carried
him
:
upon
the
top
of
the
hill
Manti
,
and
.
there
:
he
was
.
caused
,
or
.
rather
did
acknowledge
,
between
the
heavena
.
and
.
the
earth
,
[File:235]
that
what
he
had
taught
-
to
the
people
was
contrary
to
the
word
of
God
;
eid
there
:
he
suffered
an
ignominious
death
.
Nevertheless
this
did
not
put
an
end
to
the
spreading
of
priestcraft
through
the
land
:
for
there
were
many
who
loved
the
-
vain
things
of'
the
world
)
and
they
went
forth
preaching
false
doctrines
;
and
this
they
did
for
the
sake
of
riches
and
:
honor
.
Nev+
ertheless
they
durst
not
lie
,
if
it
were
known
,
for
fear
of
the
law
,
for
liars
.
were
punished
?
therefore'
they
pretended
to
preach
according
to
their
belief
:
-
and
now
the
law
could'
have
no
power
on
any
man'for
his
belief
:
And
they
durst
not
steal
,
for
fear
of
the
law
;
for
such
were
punished
;
neither
.
durst
-
they
reb
,
'nor
murder
:
for
he
that
murdered
was
punished
unto
death
,
But
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
did
not
belong
to
the
church
of
God
,
began
to
persecute
those
.
that
did
belong
to
the
church
.
of
God
,
and
had
taken
upon
them
the
name
of
Christ
;
yea
,
they
did
persecute
them
,
and
afflict
them
with
all
manner
of
words
,
and
this
because
of
their
humility
;
because
they
were
not
proud
in
their
own
eyes
,
and
.
because
they
did
impart
the
word
of
.
God
,
one
with
another
,
without
money
and
without
price
.
Now
there
wasa
strict
law
among
the
peopleof
the
church
,
that
there
should
not
any
man
,
'
belonging
to
the
church
,
arise
and
persecute
those
.
that
did
not
belong
to
the
church
,
and
that
there
should
.
be
no
persecution
among
themselves
,
Â©
Nevertheless
;
there
were
many
among
them
who
began
to
be
proud
,
and
began
to
contend
warmly
.
with
their
adversaries
,
even
.
unto
blows
;
yea
,
they
would
smite
one
-
another
with
their
fists
.
Now
this
was
.
in
the
second
year
of
the
reign
of
:
Alma
,
and
it
was
a
cause
of
much
affliction
to
the
church
;
yea
,
it
was
the
cause
.
of
much
trial
-
with
the
church
;
for
the
hearts
of
many
were
hardened
,
and
their
names
were
blotted
out
,
that
they
were
remembered
no
more
among
the
people
of
God
.
And
also
many
withdrew
themselves
from
among
them
.
Now
this
was
a
great
trial
to
those
that
;:
did
stand
-
fast
in
the
faith
;
nevertheless
,
they
were
steadfast
and
immovable
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
they
bore
with
patience
the
persecution
which
was
heaped
upon
them
.
And
when
the
priests
left
their
labor
,
to
impart'
the
word
of
God
unto
the
people
,
the
people
also
left
:
their
labors'to
hear
the
word
:
of
God
:
And
when
the
priest
had
imparted
unto
them
the
word
of
God
,
they
all
rey
[File:236]
turned
.
again
:
diligently
unto
their
labors
:
and
the
priest
,
not
esteeming
himself
above
-
+his
hearers
;
for
the
preacher
was
no
better
than
the
hearer
,
neither
was
the
teacher
any
better
than
the
learner
:
and
thus
they
were
.
all
equal
,
and
they
did
all
labor
,
every
man
according
to
his
strength
;
and
they
did
impart
of
their
substance
every
man
according
to
that
which
he
had
,
to
the
poor
,
and
the
needy
,
and
the
sick
,
and
the
afflicted
;
and
they
did
not
wear
costly
apparel
,
yet
the
were
neat
and
comely
:
and
thus
they
did
establish
the
affairs
of
the
church
:
and
thus
they
began
to
have
continual
peace
again
,
notwithstanding
all
their
persecutions
.
And
now
because
of
the
steadiness
of
the
church
,
they
began
to
be
exceeding
rich
;
having
abundance
of
all
things
whatsoever
they
stood
in
need
;
an
abundance
of
flocks
,
and
herds
,
and
fatlings
of
every
kind
,
and
also
abundance
of
grain
,
and
of
gold
;
and
of
silver
,
and
of
precious
things
;
and
abundance
of
silk
and
fine
twined
linen
,
sil
all
manner
of
good
homely
cloth
..
And
thus
in
their
prosperous
circumstances
they
did
not
send
away
any
who
were
naked
,
or
that
were
hungry
,
or
that
were
athirst
,
or
that
were
sick
,
or
that
had
not
been
nourished
;
and
they
did
not
set
their
hearts
upon
riches
;
therefore
they
were
liberal
to
all
,
both
old
and
young
,
both
bond
and
free
,
both
male
and
female
,
whether
out
of
the
church
or
in
the
church
,
having
no
respect
to
persons
as
to
those
who
stood
in
need
;
and
thus
they
did
prosper
and
become
far
more
wealthy
,
than
those
who
did
not
belong
to
their
church
.
For
those
who
did
not
belong
to
their
church
,
did
indulge
themselves
in
sorceries
,
and
in
idolatry
or
idleness
,
and
in
bablings
,
and
in
envyings
and
strife
;
wearing
costly
apparel
;
being
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
own
eyes
;
lying
,
thieving
,
robbing
,
commiting
whoredoms
,
and
murdering
,
and
all
manner
of
wickedness
;
nevertheless
,
the
law
was
put
in
force
upon
all
those
who
did
transgress
It
,
inasmuch
as
it
were
possible
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
by
thus
exercising
the
law
upon
them
,
every
man
maifeciaty
according
to
that
which
he
had
done
,
they
became
more
still
,
and
durst
not
commit
any
wickedness
,
if
it
were
known
;
therefore
,
there
was
much
peace
among
the
people
of
Nephi
,
until
the
fifth
year
of
the
reign
.
of
the
judges
..
And
-
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
fifth
year
of
their
reign
,
there
began
to
be
a
contention
among
the
people
,
fot
a
certain
man
,
being
called
Am
[File:237]
lici
;
he
being
a
very
cunning
man
,
yea
,
a
wise
man
,
as
to
the
wisdom
of
the
world
;
he
being
after
the
or
der
of
the
man
that
slew
-
Gideon
by
the
sword
,
who
was
executed
according
to
the
law
.
Now
this
Amlici
had
,
by
his
cunning
,
drawn
away
much
people
after
him
;
even
so
much
that
they
began
to
be
very
powerful
;
and
they
began
to
endeavor
to
establish
Amlici
to
be
a
king
over
the
people
.
Now
this
was
alarming
to
the
people
of
the
church
,
and
also
to
all
those
who
had
not
been
drawn
away
after
the
persuasions
of
Amlici
:
for
they
knew
that
according
to
their
law
that
such
things
must
be
established
by
the
voice
of
the
people
;
therefore
,
if
it
were
possible
that
Amlici
should
gain
the
voice
of
the
people
,
he
being
a
wicked
man
,
would
deprive
them
of
their
rights
and
privileges
of
the
church
,
&c
:
for
it
was
his
intent
to
destroy
the
charch
of
God
.
And
it
came
to
pasg
that
the
people
assembled
themselves
together
throughout
all
the
land
,
every
man
according
to
his
mind
,
whether
it
were
for
or
against
Amlici
,
in
separate
bodies
,
having
much
dispute
and
wonderful
contentions
one
with
another
;
and
thus
they
did
assemble
themseives
together
,
to
cast
in
their
voices
concerning
the
matter
:
and
they
were
laid
be
fore
the
judges
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
people
came
against
Amlici
,
that
he
was
not
made
king
over
the
people
.
Now
this
did
cause
much
joy
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
were
against
him
;
but
Amlici
did
stir
up
those
who
were
in
his
favor
,
to
dnger
against
those
who
were
not
in
his
favor
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
gathered
themselves
together
,
and
did
consecrate
Amlici
to
be
their
king
.
Now
when
Amlici
was
made
king
over
them
,
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
take
up
arms
against
their
brethren
;
and
this
he
did
,
that
he
might
subject
themtohim
.
Now
the
people
of
Amlici
were
distinguished
by
the
name
of
Amlici
,
being
called
Amlicites
;
and
the
remainder
were
called
Nephites
,
or
the
people
of
God
:
therefore
the
people
of
the
Nephites
were
aware
of
the
intent
of
the
Amlicites
,
and
therefore
they
did
prepare
to
meet
them
;
yea
,
they
did
arm
themselves
with
swords
,
and
with
cimeters
,
and
with
bows
,
and
with
arrows
,
and
with
stones
,
and
with
slings
,
and
with
all
manner
of
weapons
of
war
,
of
every
kind
;
and
thus
they'
were
prepared
to
meet
the
Amlicites
at
the
time
of
their
coming
.
Â©
And
there
were
appointed
[File:238]
eaptains
,
and
higher
captains
,
and
chief
captains
,
aceording
to
:
their
numbers
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amlici
-
did
arm
his
men
with
all
manner
of
weapons
of
war
,
of
every
kind
;
and
he
also
appointed
rulers
and
leaders
over
his
people
,
to
lead
them
.
to
war
against
their
brethren
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Amlicites
came
upon
the
hill
Amnihu
,
which
was
east
of
the
river
Sidon
,
which
ran
.
by
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
there
they
began
to
make
war
with
the
Nephites
..
Now
Alma
,
being
the
chief
judge
,
and
the
governor
of
the
people
of
Nephi
,
therefore
he
went
up
with
his
people
,
yea
,
with
his
captains
,
and
chief
captains
,
yea
,
at
the
head
of
his
armies
,
against
the
Amlicites
to
battle
;.
and
they
began
to
slay
the
Amlicites
upon
the
hill
east
of
,
Sidon
,
And
the
Amlicites
did
contend
with
the
Nephites
with
great
strength
,
imsomuch
that
many
of
the
Nephites
did
fall
betore
the
Amlicites
;
nevertheless
the
Lord
did
strengthen
the
hand
of
the
Nephites
,
that
they
slew
the
Amlicites
with
a
great
slaughter
,
that
they
began
to
flee
before
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
did
pursue
the
Amlicites
all
that
day
,
and
did
slay
them
with
much
slaughter
,
insomuch
that
there
was
slain
of
the
Amlicites
twelve
thousand
five
hundred
thirty
and
two
,
souls
;
and
there
was
slain
of
the
Rephites
,
six
thousand
five
hundred
sixty
and
two
souls
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Alma
could
pursue
the
Analicites
.
no
longer
,
he
caused
that
his
people
should
pitch
their
tents
,
in
the
valley
of
Gideon
,
the
valley
being
called
after
that
Gideon
who
was
slain
by
the
hand
of
Nehor
with
the
sword
:
and
.
in
this
valley
the
Nephites
did
pitch
their
tents
for
the
night
.
And
Alma
sent
spies
to
follow
the
remnant
of
the
Amlicites
,
that
he
might
know
of
their
plans
and
their
plots
,
whereby
he
might
guard
himself
against
them
,
that
he
might
preserve
his
people
from
being
destroyed
.
Now
those
whom
.
he
had
sent
out
to
watch
the
camp
of
the
Amlicites
,
were
called
Zeram
,
and
Amnor
,
and
Manti
,
and
Limher
;
these
were
they
who
went
out
with
their
men
to
watch
the
camp
.
of
.
the
Amlicites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
they
retumed
into
the
camp
of
the
Nephites
,
in
great
haste
,
being
reatly
astonished
,
and
struck
with
much
fear
,
saying
,
hold
,
we
followed
the
camp
of
the
Amlicites
,
and
to
our
great
astonishment
,
in
the
Jand
of
Minon
,
above
[File:239]
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
in
the
course
of
the
land
of
Nephi
;
we
saw
a
numerous
host
of
the
Lamanites
;
and
behold
,
the
Amlicites
have
joined
them
,
and
they
are
upon
our
brethren
in
that
land
;
and
they
are
fleeing
before
them
with
their
flocks
,
and
their
wives
,
and
their
children
,
towards
our
city
;
and
except
we
make
haste
,
they
obtain
poxsession
of
our
city
;
and
our
fathers
,
and
our
wives
,
and
our
children
be
slain
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
Nephi
took
their
tents
,
and
departed
out
of
the
valley
of
Gideon
towards
their
city
,
which
was
the
city
of
Zarahemla
.
And
behold
,
as
they
were
crossing
the
river
Sidon
,
the
Lamanites
and
the
Amlicites
,
being
as
:
numerous
almost
,
as
it
were
,
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
,
came
upon
them
.
to
destroy
them
;
nevertheless
the
Nephites
,
being
strengthened
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
having
prayed
mightly
to
him
-
that
he
would
deliver
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
;
therefore
the
Lord
did
hear
their
cries
,
and
did
strengthen
them
,
and
the
Lamanites
and
the
Amlicites
did
fall
before
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
fought
with
Amlici
with
the
sword
,
face
to
face
;
and
they
did
contend
mightily
,
one
with
another
.
And
it
-
caine
to
pass
that
Alma
,
being
a
man
.
o
?
God
,
being
exercised
:
with
much
faith
,
cried
,
saying
,
O
Lord
,
have
merey
and
spare
my
hfe
,
that
I
may
be
an
instrument
in
thy
hands
,
to
save
and
preserve
,
this
people
.
Now
when
Alma
had
:
said
-
these
words
,
he
contended
again
with
Amlici
;
and
he
was
strengthened
,
insomuch
that
he
slew
Amlici
with
the
sword
.
And
he
also
contended
with
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
;
but
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
fled
back
from
before
Alma
,
and
sent
his
guards
to
contend
with
Alma
.
Bat
Alma
,
with
his
guards
,
contended
with
the
guards
of
-
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
,
until
he
slew
and
drove
them
back
;
and
thus
he
cleared
the
ground
,
orirather
:
the
bank
,
which
was
on
the
west
of
the
river
Sidon
,
throw
:
ing
the
bodies
of
the
Lamanites
who
had
been
slain
,
into
the
waters
of
Sidon
,
that
thereby
his
people
might
have
room
to
cross
.
and
contend
with
the
Lamanites
and
the
Amlicites
,
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
Sidon
,
Andit
came'to
pass
that
when
they
had
all
crossed
the
river
Sidon
that
the
Lamanites
and
the
Amlicites
began
to
flee
before
them
,
notwithstanding
they
were
#0
numerous
that
they
could
not
be
.
numbered
;
and
they
fled
.
before
the
Nephites
,
towards
the
wilderness
[File:240]
which
was
west
and
north
,
away
beyond
the
borders
of
the
Jand
;
and
the
Nephites
did
:
pursue
them
with
their
might
,
and
did
slay
them
;
yea
,
they
were
met
on
every
hand
,
and
slain
,
and
driven
,
until
they
were
seattered
on
the
west
,
and
on
the
north
,
until
they
had
reached
the
wilderness
,
which
was
called
Herinounts
;
and
it
was
that
part
of
the
wilderness
which
was
infested
by
wild
and
ravenous
beasts
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
many
died
in
the
wilderness
of
their
wounds
,
and
were
devoured
by
those
beasts
,
and
also
the
yultures
of
the
air
:
and
their
bones
have
been
found
,
and
have
been
heaped
up
on
the
earth
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
,
who
were
not
slain
by
the
weapons
of
war
,
after
having
buried
those
who
had
been
slain
:
Now
the
.
number
of
the
slain
were
not
numbered
,
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
number
;
after
they
had
finisned
burying
their
dead
,
they
all
returned
to
their
lands
,
and
to
their
houses
,
and
their
wives
,
and
their
children
.
Now
many
women
and
children
had
been
slain
with
the
sword
,
and
also
many
of
their
flocks
and
their
herds
;
and
also
many
of
their
fields
of
grain
were
destroyed
,
for
they
were
trodden
down
by
the
hosts
of
men
.
And
now
as
many
of
the
Lamanites
and
the
Amlieites
who
had
been
slain
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
Sidon
,
were
cast
into
the
waters
of
Sidon
;
and
behold
,
their
bones
are
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
,
and
they
are
many
.
And
the
Amlicites
were
distinguished
from
the
Naphites
for
they
had
marked
themselves
with
red
in
their
foreheads
,
after
the
manner
of
the
Lamanites
;
nevertheless
they
had
not
shorn
their
heads
like
unto
the
Lamanites
.
Now
the
heads
of
the
.
Lamanites
were
shorn
;
and
they
were
naked
,
save
it
were
skin
,
which
was
girded
about
their
loins
,
and
also
their
armour
,
which
was
girded
aboutthem
,
and
their
bows
,
and
their
arrows
,
and
their
stones
,
and
their
slings
,
&c
.
And
the
akins
of
the
Lamanites
were
dark
,
according
to
the
mark
which
wasset
upon
their
fathers
,
which
was
a
curse
upon
them
because
of
their
transgression
.
and
their
rebellion
against
their
brethren
,
who
consisted
of
Nephi
,
Jacob
,
and
Joseph
,
and
Sam
,
who
were
just
and
holy
men
.
And
their
brethren
sought
to
destroy
them
;
therefore
they
were
cursed
;
and
the
Lord
God
set
a
mark
upon
them
,
yea
,
upon
Laman
and
Lemuel
,
and
also
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
and
Ishmaelitish
women
:
and
this
was
done
,
that
their
seed
,
might
be
distinguished
from
the
seed
of
their
brethren
,
that
thereby
the
Lord
God
might
preserve
[File:241]
his
people
,
that
.
they
might
notâ
mix
and
,
believe
in
incorrect
traditions
which
would
prove
their
destruction
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
did
mingle
his
seed
with
that
of
the
Lamanites
,
did
bring
the
same
curse
upon
his
seed
;
therefore
whomsoever
suffered
himself
to
be
led
away
by
the
Lamanites
,
were
called
that
head
,
and
there
-
was
a
mark
set
upon
him
.
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
would
not
believe
in
the
tradition
of
the
Lamanites
,
but
believed
those
records
which
were
brought
out
.
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,.
and
also
in
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
,
which
were
correct
,
who
believed
in
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
kept
them
,
were
called
the
Nephites
,
or
the
people
of
Nephi
,
from
that
time
forth
;
and
it
is
taey
who
have
kept
the
records
which
are
true
of
their
people
,
and
.
also
of
the
people
of
the
Lamanites
.
Now
we
will
return
again
to
the
Amlicites
,
for
they
also
had
a
mark
set
upon
them
;
yea
,
they
set
the
-
mark
upon
themselves
;
yea
,
even
,
a
mark
of
red
upon
their
foreheads
..
Thus
the
word
of
God
is
fulfilled
,
for
these
are
the
words
which
he
said
to
Nephi
:
Beheld
,
the
Lamanites
have
I
cursed
;
and
[will
seta
mark
on
them
,
that
they
and
their
seed
may
be
separated
from
thee
and
thy
seed
,
from
this
time
henceforth
and
forever
,
except
they
repent
of
their
wickedness
and
turn
to
me
,
that
I
may
have
mercy
upon
them
.
And
again
:
I
wiil
set
a
mark
upon
him
that
mingleth
his
seed
with
thy
brethren
,
that
they
may
be
cursed
also
.
And
again
:
I
will
seta
mark
vpon
him
that
fighteth
against
thee
and
thy
seed
.
AndagainI
say
,
he
that
depena
from
thee
,
shall
no
more
be
called
thy
seed
;
and
.
will
bless
thee
,
&c
.
and
whomsoeyer
shall
be
called
thy
seed
,
henceforth
and
.
forever
:
and
these
were
the
promises
.
of
the
Lord
unto
Nephi
,
and
to
his
seed
...
Now
the
Amlicites
knew
.
not
.
that
they
were
fufilling
.
the
words
of
God
,
when
they
began
to
mark
themselvesin
their
foreheads
;
nevertheless
.
they
had
come
out
:
in
open
rebellion
against
God
;
therefore
it
was
expedient
thatthe
curse
should
fall
upon
:
them
.
.
Now
I
would
that
ye
should
see
that
they
brought
upon
themselves
the
curse
;
and
even
so
doth
-
every
man
.
that
is
cursed
,
bring
upon
himself
his
own
condemnation
.
sick
Nowit
came
.
to
pass
that
not
.
many
days
after
the
battle
which
was
:
fought
.
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
by
the
Lamanites
:
and
the
:
Amlicites
,
that
there
.
was
.
another
army
:
of
the
Lamanites
:
came
in
upon
the
people
of
Nephi
,
in
the
same
.
place
,
where
the
first
army
met
the
Amlicites
.
And
it
came
-
to
.
pass
that
there
was
an
[File:242]
army
sent
to
drive
them
out
of
theirland
.
Now
Alma
himself
being
-
afflicted
with
a
wound
,
did
not
go
up
to
batile
at
this
time
against
the
Lamanites
;
but
he
sent
up
@
numerous
army
against
them
;
and
they
:
went
up
and
slew
many
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
drove
the
:
remainder
of
them
out
of
the
borders
of
their
land
;
and
then
they
returned
.
again
,
and
began
to
establish
peace
in
the
land
,
being
troubled
no
more
for
a
time
with
their
enemies
.
'
Now
all
these
things
were
done
,
yea
,
all
these
wars
and
contentions
were
commenced
and
ended
,
in
the
fifth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
;
and
in
one
year
were
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
of
souls
sent
to
the
eternal
world
,
that
they
might
reap
their
rewards
according
to
their
works
,
whether
they
were
good
or
whether
they
were
bad
,
to
reap
eternal
happiness
or
eternal
misery
,
according
to
the
spirit
which
they
listed
to
obey
,
whether
it
be
a
good
spirit
or
a
bad
one
;
for
every
man
receiveth
wages
of
him
whom
he
listeth
to
obey
,
and
this
according
to
the
words
of
the
spirit
of
prophecy
;
therefore
let
it
be
according
to
the
truth
.
And
thus
endeth
the
fifth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
Judges
.
CHAPTER
Ii
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
.
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
there
were
no
contentions
nor
wars
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
but
the
people
were
afflicted
,
yea
,
'
greatly
afflicted
for
.
the
loss
of
their
brethren
,
and
also
for
the
Joss
oftheir
flocks
and
herds
,
and
also
for
the
loss
of
their
fields
of
rain
,
which
were
tredden
under
.
foot
-
and
destroyed
by
the
Lamanites
,
and
so
great
were
.
their
afflictions
,
that
every
soul
had
cause
to
mourn
;,
and
they
believed
that
it
was
the
judgments
of
God
sent
upon
them
,
because
:
of
their
wickedness
.
and
their
abominations
:
therefore
they
were
awakened
to
a
remembrance
of
their
duty
.
And
:
they
began
toestablish
the
eburch
more
fully
;
yea
,
and
-
many
were
baptized
in
the
waters
of
Sidon
,
and
were
jomed
to
.
the
church
of
God
;:
yea
,
they
were
baptized
:
by
the
dhand
of
Almay
:
whochad
been
consecrated
the
high
priest'
over
the
people
of
the
church
,
by
the
hand
of
his
father
Almas
).
/
apy
ay
sage
[File:243]
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
there
were
about
three
thousands
five
hundred
souls
that
united
themselves
to
the
church
of
God
,
and
-
were
baptized
.
And
thus
endeth
the
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
;
and
there
was
continual
peace
in
al
).
that
time
.
Andit
came
to
pass
in
the
eighth
year
of
the
reign
.
of
the
judges
,
that
the
people
of
the
church
began
:
to
wax
proud
,
because
of
their
exceeding
riches
,
and
their
fine
silks
,
and
their
fine
twined
linen
,
and'
because
.
of
their
many
flocks
.
and
herds
,
and
their
gold
,
and
their
silver
,
and
all
manner
,
of
precious
things
,
which
they
had
obtained
by
their
industry
;
and
in
all
these
things
were
they
lifted
up
m
the
pride
of
their
eyes
,
for
they
began
to
weer
very
costly
apparel
.
Now
this
was
the
cause
of
much
affliction
to
Alma
,
yea
,
and
to
many
of
the
people
whom
Alma
had
consecrated
to
be
teachers
,
and
priesis
,
and
elders
,
over
the
church
;
-
yea
,
many
of
them
were
sorely
grieved
for
the
wickedness
which
they
saw
had
begun
to
be
among
:
their
people
.
For
they
saw
and
beheld
with
great
sorrow
,
that
the
people
of
the
church
began
to
be
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
eyes
,
and
to
set
their
hearts
upon
riches
and
upon
the
vain
things
of
the
world
;
that
they
began
to
be
scornful
,
one
towards
another
,
and
they
began
to
persecute
those
that
did
not
believe
according
to
their
own
will
and
pleasure
.
And
thus
in
this
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
there
began
to
be
great
contentions
among
the
people
of
the
church
;
yea
,
there
were
envyings
,
and
strife
;
and
malice
,
and
persecutions
,
and
pride
,
even
to
exceed
:
the
pride
of
those
who
did
not
belong
to
the
church
of
God
.
And
thus
ended
the
eighth
year
,
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
;
and
the
wickedness
of
the
church
was
a
great
stumbling
biock
to
those
who
did
not
belong
to
the
church
;
and
thus
the
church
began
to
fail
in
its
progress
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
ninth
year
,
Alma
saw
the
wickedness
of
the
church
,
and
he
-
saw
-
also
that
the
example
of
the
church
began
to
lead
those
who
were
unbelievers
,
on
from
one
-
piece
of
iniquity
to
another
;
thus
bringing
on
the
destruction
of
the
people
;
yea
,
hesaw
great
inequality
among
the
people
,
some
lifting
themselves
up
with
their
.
pride
,
despising
others
,
turning
their
backs
upon
the
needy
,
and
the
naked
,
and
those
who
were
hungry
,
and
those
who
were
athirst
,
and
those
who
were
sick
and
afflicted
.
Now
this
was
a
great
cause
for
lamentations
[File:244]
among
the
people
,
while
others
were
abasing
them
.
selyes
,
succoring
those
who
stood
in
need
of
their
succor
,
such
as
imparting
their
substance
to
the
poor
and
the
needy
;
feeding
the
hungry
;
and'suffering
all
manner
of
afflictions
,
tor
Christ's
sake
,
who
should
come
according
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy
,
looking
forward
to
that
day
,
thus
retaining
a
remission
of
their
sins
;
being
filled
-
with
great
joy
,
because
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
,
according
to
the
will
,
and
power
,
and
deliverance
of
Jesus
Christ
from
the
bands
of
death
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
,
having
seen
the
afflictions
of
the
humble
followers
of
God
,
and
the
persecutions
which
were
heaped
upon
them
by
the
remainder
of
his
people
,
and
seeing
all
their
inequality
,
began
to
be
.
very
sorrowful
;
nevertneless
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
did
not
fail
him
.
And
he
selected
a
wise
man
who
was
among
the
elders
of
the
church
,
and
gave
him
power
according
to
the
voice
of
the
people
,
that
he
inight
have
power
to
enact
laws
according
to
the
laws
which
had
been
given
,
and
to
put
them
in
force
,
according
to
the
wickedness
and
the
crimes
of
the
people
.
Now
this
man's
name
was
Nephihah
,
and
he
was
appointed
chief
judge
;
and
he
sat
in
the
judgment
seat
,
to
judge
and
to
govern
the
peopie
.
Now
Alma
did
not
grant
unto
him
the
office
of
being
high
priest
over
the
chnrch
,
but
he
retained
the
office
of
high
priest
unto
himself
;
but
he
delivered
the
judgment
seat
unto
Nephihah
:
and
this
he
did
,
that
he
himself
might
go
forth
among
his
people
,
or
among
the
people
of
Nephi
,
that
he
might
preach
the
word
of
God
unto
them
,
to
stir
them
up
in
remembrance
of
their
duty
,
and
that
he
might
pull
down
,
-
by
the
word
of
God
,
all
the
pride
and
craftiness
,
and
all
the
contentions
which
were
among
his
people
,
seeing
no
way
that
he
might
reclaim
them
,
save
it
were
in
bearing
down
in
pure
testimony
against
them
.
And
thus
in
the
commencement
of
the
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
Alma
delivered
up
the
judgment
seat
to
Nephihah
,
and
confined
himself
wholly
to
the
high
priesthood
of
the
holy
order
of
God
,
to
the
testimony
of
the
word
,
according
to
the
spirit
of
revelation
and
prophecy
.
[File:245]
CHAPTER
:
Ill
.
The
words
which
Alma
,
the
High
Priest
,
according
to
the
holy
erder
af
God
,
delivered
to
the
people
in
thetr
cities
and
villages
throu
ghout
the
land
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
began
to
deliver
the
word
of
God
unto
the
people
,
first
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
from
thence
throughout
all
the
land
.
.
And
these
are
the
words
which
he
spake
to
the
people
in
the
.
church
which
was
established
in
the
city
of
Zarahemla
,
according
to
his
own
record
,
saying
:
I
Alma
,
having
been
consecrated
by
my
father
Alma
,
.
to
bea
high
priest
over
the
church
of
God
,
he
having
power
and
authority
from
God
to
do
these
things
,
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
-
he
began
to
establish
a
church
in
the
land
which
was
in
the
borders
of
Nephi
;
yea
,
the
land
which
was
called
the
land
of
Mormon
;
yea
,
and
he
did
baptize
his
brethren
in
the
watersof
Mormon
.
And
behold
,
I
say
untoyou
,
they
were
delivered
out
of
the
hands
of
the
people
ofking
Noah
,
by
the
mercy
and
power
of
God
.
And
behold
,
after
that
,
they
were
brought
into
bondage
by
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
in
the
wilderness
;
yea
,
I
say
unto
you
,
they
were
in
captivity
,
and
again
the
Lord
did
deliver
them
out
of
bondage
by
the
power
of
his
word
;
and
we
were
brought
into
this
land
and
here
we
began
to
establish
the
church
of
God
throughout
this
land
also
.
And
now
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
my
brethren
,
you
that
belong
to
this
church
,
have
you
sufficiently
retained
in
remembrance
the
captivity
of
your
fathers
?
Yea
,
and
have
you
sufficiently
retained
in
remembrance
his
mercy
and
long
-
suffering
towards
them
?
And
moreover
,
have
ye
sufliciently
retained
:
in
remembrance
that
he
has
delivered
their
souls
from
hell
?
Behold
,
he
changed
their
hearts
;
yea
,
he
awaked
.
them
out
of
a
deep
sleep
,
and
they
awoke
unto
God
.
Behold
,
they
were
in
the
midst
of
darkness
;
nevertheless
,
their
souls
were
illuminated
by
the
light
of
the
everlasting
word
;
yea
,
they
were
encircled
about
by
the
bands
of
death
,
and
the
.
chains
of
hell
,
and
an
.
everlasting
destruction
did
await
them
.
And
now]
ask
:
of
you
my
brethren
,
were
they
destroyed
?
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
,
they
werenot
.
And
again
I
ask
,
were
the
bands
of
death
broken
,
and
the
chains
:
of
hell
which
encircled
them
about
,
were
they
loosed
?::
I
:
say
unto
you
,
yea
,
they
were
loosed
,
and
their
souls
did
expand
,
and
they
did
sing
redeeming
love
.
And
I
say
.
unto
[File:246]
you
,
that
they
are
saved
,.
And
.
now
I
ask
of
you
on
what
conditions
are
they
saved
?
Yea
,
what
grounds
had
they
to
hope
for
salvation
?
What
is
the
.
cause
of
their
being
loosed
from
the
bands
of
death
?
Yea
,
and
also
,
the
chains
of
hell
?
Behold
,
I
can
tell
you
:
did
not
my
father
Alma
believe
in
the
words
which
were
delivered
by
the
mouth
of
Ahinadi
?
And
was
he
nota
boly
prophet
?
Did
he
not
speak
the
words
of
God
,
and
my
father
Alma
believe
them
?
And
according
to
his
faith
there
was
a
mighty
change
wrought
in
-
his
heart
.
Behold
I
say
unto
you
,
that
this
is
all
true
.
And
behold
,
he
preached
the
word
unto
your
fathers
,
and
a
mighty
change
was
also
wreught
in
their
hearts
;
and
they
humbled
themselves
,
and
.
put
their
trust
in
the
true
and
living
God
.
And
behold
,
they
were
faithful
until
the
end
;
therefore
they
were
saved
.
And
now
behold
,
I
ask
of
you
,
my
brethren
of
the
church
,
have
ye
spiritually
been
born
of
Godt
?
Have
ye
received
his
image
in
your
countenances
?
Have
ye
experienced
this
mighty
change
in
your
hearts
?
Do
ye
exercise
faith
in
the
redemption
of
him
who
created
you
?
Do
you
look
forward
with
an
eye
of
faith
,
and
view
this
mortal
body
raisedin
immtorality
,
and
this
corruption
raised
in
incorruption
,
to
stand
before
God
,
to
be
judged
according
to
the
deeds
which
.
have
been
dane
in
the
mortal
body
?
I
say
unto
you
,
can
you
imagine
to
yourselves
that
ye
hear
the
voice
of
the
Lord
,
saying
unto
you
,
in
that
day
,
come
unto
me
ye
blessed
,
for
behold
,
your
works
have
been
the
works
of
righteousness'upon
the
face
of
ihe
earth
?
Or
do
ye
imagine
to
yourselves
that
ye
can
Jie
unto
the
Lord
in
that
day
,
and
say
,
Lord
,
our
works
have
been
righteous
works
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
,
and
that
he
will
save
you
?
Or
etherwise
,
can
ye
.
imagine
yourselves
brought
before
the
tribunal
of
God
,
with
your
souls
filled
with
guilt
and
remorse
;
having
a
remembrance
of
all
your
guilt
;
yea
,
a
perfect
remembrance
of
all
your
wickedness
;
yea
,
a
remembrance
that
ye
have
set
at
defiance
the
commandments
of
God
?
1
say
unto
you
,
can
ye
look
up
to
God
at
that
day
with
a
pure
heart
and
clean
hands
?
I
say
unto
you
,
can
you
look
up
,
having
the
image
of
God
engraven
.
upon
your
countenancest
JI
say
unto
you
,
can
ye
-
think
of
ing
saved
when
you
have
yielded
yourselves
to
become
subjects
to
the
devil
?
J
say
unto
you
,
ye
will
know
at
that
day
,
that
:
ye
:
cannot
be
saved
:
for
there
can
no
:
man
be
saved
:
except
his
garments
are
washed
[File:247]
white
:
yea
,
his
garments
must
be
purified
until
they
are
cleansed
from
all
stain
,
through
the
blood
of
him
of
whom
it
has
been
spoken
by
our
fathers
who
should
come
to
redeem
his
people
from
their
sins
.
-
And
now
Task
of
you
,
my
brethren
,
how'will
any
of
you
feel
,
if
ye
shall
stand
before
the
bar
of
God
,
having
your
garments
stained
with
blood
,
and
all
manner
of
tilthiness
?
Behold
,
what
will
these
things
testify
against
you
?
Behold
,
will
they
not
testify
that
ye
are
murderers
,
yea
,
and
also
that
ye
are
guilty
of
all
manner
of
wickedness
?
Behold
,
my
brethren
,
de
ye
suppose
that
such
an
one
can
have
a
place
to
sit
down
in
the
kingdom
of
God
,
with
Abraham
,
with
Isaac
,
and
with
Jacob
,
and
also
all
the
holy
prophets
,
whose
garments
are
cleansed
,
and
are
spotless
,
pure
and
white
?
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
,
except
ye
make
our
Creator
a
liar
from
the
beginning
,
or
suppose
that
heis
a
liar
from
the
beginning
,
ye
cannot
suppose
that
such
can
have
place
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
,
but
they
shall
be
cast
out
,
for
they
are
the
children
of
the
kingdom
of
the
devil
.
And
now
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
my
brethren
,
if
ye
have
experienced
a
change
of
heart
,
and
if
ye
have
felt
to
sing
the
song
of
redeeming
love
,
I
would
ask
,
can
ye
feel
sonow
?
Have
ye
walked
,
keeping
yourselves
blameless
before
God
?
Could
ye'
say
,
if
ye
were
called
to
die
at
this
time
,
within
yourselves
,
that
ye
have
been
sufficiently
humble
?
That
your
garments
have
been
cleansed
and
made
white
,
through
the
blood
of
Christ
,
who
will
come
to
redeem
his
people
from
their
sins
?
Behold
,
are
ye
stripped
.
of
pride
?
I
say
unto
you
,
if
ye
are
not
,
ye
are
not
prepared
to
meet
God
.
Behold
ye
must
prepare
quickly
,
forthe
kingdom
of
heaven
is
soon
at
hand
,
and
such
an
one
hath
not
eternal
life
.
Behold
,
1
say
,
is
there
one
among
you
who
is
not
stripped
of
envy
?
I
say
unte
you
,
that
such
an
one
is
not
prepared
,
and
I
would
that
he
should
prepare
quickly
,
for
the
hour
is
close
at
hand
,
and
he
knoweth
not
when
the
time
shall
come
;
for
such
an
one
is
not
found
guiltless
.
And
again
I
say
unto
you
,
is
there
one
among
you
that
doth
make'a
mock
of
his
brother
,
or
that
heapeth
upon
him
persecutions
?
Wo
unto
such
an
one
,
for
he'is
not
prepared
,
and
the
time
is
dt
hand
that
he
must
repent
,
or
he
cannot
be
saved
;
yea
;
even
wo
wnto
-
all
ye
workers
of
iniquity
;
repent
,
repent
,
for
the
LordGod
-
hath
spoken
it
.
Behold
,
he
sendeth'an
invitation
unto
all
men
;
forthe
arms
of
mercy
are
ex
[File:248]
tended
towards
them
,
and
he
-
saith
,
repent
,
and
J
will
reeeive
you
:
yea
,
he
saith
,
come
unto
me
and
ye
shall
partake
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life
;
yea
,
ye
shall
eat
and
drink
of
the
bread
and
the
waters
of
hfe
freely
;
yea
,
come
unto
me
and
bring
forth
works
of
righteousness
,
and
ye
shall
not
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
:
for
behold
,
the
time
is
at
-
hand
that
whosoever
bringeth
forth
not
good
fruit
,
or
whosoever
doeth
not
the
works
of
righteousness
,
the
same
haye
cause
to
wail
and
mourn
.
O
ye
workers
of
iniquity
;
ye
that
are
puffed
up
in
the
vain
things
of
the
world
;
ye
that
have
professed
to
have
known
the
ways
of
righteousness
;
nevertheless
have
gone
astray
,
as
sheep
having
no
shepherd
,
notwithstanding
a
shepherd
hath
called
after
you
,
and
art
still
calling
after
you
,
but
ye
will
not
hearken
unto
his
voice
.
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
the
good
shepherd
doth
call
you
;
yea
,
and
in
his
own
name
he
doth
call
you
,
which
is
the
name
of
Christ
;
and
if
ye
will
.
not
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
good
shepherd
,
to
the
name
by
which
ye
are
called
,
behold
,
ye
are
not
the
sheep
of
the
good
shepherd
.
And
now
if
ye
are
not
the
sheep
of
the
good
shepherd
,
of
what
fold
are
ye
?
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
the
devil
is
your
shepherd
,
and
ye
are
of
his
fold
;
and
now
who
can
deny
this
?
'
Behold
,
I
say
unto
.
you
,
whosoever
denieth
this
,
is
a
liar
and
a
child
of
the
devil
;
for
I
say
unto
you
,
that
whatsoever
is
good
,
cometh
from
God
,
and
whatsoever
is
evil
,
cometh
from
the
devil
;
therefore
,
if
a
man_
bring
:
eth
forth
good
works
,
he
hearkeneth
unto
the
voice
of
the
good
shepherd
,
and
he
deth
follow
him
;
but
whosoever
bringeth
forth
evil
works
,
the
same
becometh
a
child
of
the
devil
:
for
he
hearkeneth
unto
his
yoice
,
and
doth
follow
him
.
And
whosoever
doeth
this
must
receive
his
wages
of
him
;
therefore
,
fur
his
wages
he
receiveth
death
,
as
to
things
pertaining
unto
righteousness
,
being
dead
unto
all
good
works
.
And
now
my
brethren
,
1
would
that
ye
should
hear
me
,
for
I
speak
in
the
energy
of
my
soul
;
for
behold
,
1
have
spoken
unto
you
plain
,
that
ye
cannot
err
,
or
have
spoken
according
to
the
commandments
of
God
..
For
Tam
called
to
speak
after
this
manner
,
according
:
to
the
holy
order
of
God
,
which
is
in
Christ
.
Jesus
;
yea
I
.
am
.
commanded
to
stand
and
testify
unto
this
people
the
things
which
have
.
been
.
spoken
.
by
.
our
)
fathers
,
concerning
the
things
which
are
to
:
come
,
And
:
this
is
not
all
.
Do
ye
not
suppose'
that
.)
know
:
of
.
these
[File:249]
things
myself
?
Behold
,
I
testify
unto
you
,
that
Ido
know
that
these
things
whereof
I
have
spoken
,
are
true
.
And
how
do
ye
suppose
that
know
of
their
surety
?
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
they
are
made
known
unto
me
by
the
-
holy
spirit
of
God
.
Behold
,
I
have
fasted
and
prayed
many
days
,
that
I
might
know
these
things
of
myself
.
And
now
I
do
know
of
myself
that
they
are
true
;
for
the
Lord
God
hath
made
them
manifest
unto
me
by
his
holy
spirit
;
and
this
is
the
spirit
of
revelation
which
is
in
me
.
And
moreover
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
as
it
has
thus
been
revealed
unto
me
,
that
the
words
which
have
been
spoken

I

And

yea
,
to
cry
unto
them
that
they

yea

that

And
again
1
say
unto
you
,
the
spirit
saith
,
behold
,
the
axe
is
laid
at
the
root
of
the
tree
;
therefore

shall

yea
,
a
fire
which
cannot
be
consumed
;
even
an
unquenchable
fire
.
Behold
,
and
remember
,
the
holy
one
hath
spoken
:
it
:.
And
now
my
beloved
brethren
;
say
unto
you
,
can'ye
[File:250]
withstand
these
sayings
;
yea
,
can
ye
lay
aside
these
things
,
and
trample
the
holy
.
one
under
your
feet
:
yea
,
can
ye
be
puffed
up
in
the
pride
of
your
hearts
;
yea
,
will
ye
still
persist
in
the
wearing
of
costly
apparel
,
and
setting
your
hearts
upon
the
vain
things
of
the
world
,
upon
your
riches
;
yea
,
will
ye
persist
in
supposing
that
ye
are
better
one
,
than
another
:
yea
,
will
ye
persist
in
the
persecutions
of
your
brethien
,
who
humble
themselves
,
and
do
walk
after
the
holy
order
of
God
,
wherewith
they
have
been
brought
into
this
church
,
having
been
sanctified
by
the
holy
spirit
:
and
they
do
bring
forth
works
which
are
meet
for
repentance
;
yea
,
and
will
-
you
persist
in
turning
your
backs
upon
the
poor
,
and
the
needy
,
and
in
.
withholding
your
substance
from
them
?
And
finally
,
all
ye
that
will
persist
in
your
wickedness
,
say
unto
you
,
that
these
are
they
who
shall
be
hewn
down
and
cast
.
into
the
fire
,
except
they
speedily
repent
.
And
now
I
say
unto
you
,
all
you
that
are
desirious
to
follow
tre
voice
of
the
good
shep'ierd
,
come
ye
out
from
the
wicked
,
and
be
ye
separate
,
und
touca
not
their
unclean
things
;
and
bebold
,
their
names
shall
-
be
blotted
out
,
that
the
names
of
the
wicked
shall
not
be
numbered
among
the
names
of
the
righteous
,
that
the
word
of
God
may
be

,
which
saith
,
the
names

of

For
the
names
of

righteous
shall
be
written
in
the
book
of
life
;
and
unto
them
will
[
grant
an
inheritance
at
my
tight
hand
.
And
now
my
brethren
,
what
have
ye
to
say
against
this
?
[
say
unto
you
,
if
ye
speak
against
it
,
it
matters
not
,
for
the
word
of
God
.
must
be

For

,
doth

,
that
the
wolves
enter

And
_behold
,
if

doth
he
not
drive
him
out
?
Yea
,
and
at
the
lest
,
if
he
can
,
he
will
destroy
him

And
now
I
say
anto
you
,
that
the
good
shepherd
doth
call
after
you
;
and
if
you
will
hearken
unte

And
now

CHAPTER
.
IV
.
Ayp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
.
after
Alma
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
the
people
of
the
church
,
which
was
established
in
the
city
of
Zarahemla
,
he
ordained
priests
and
elders
,
by
laying
on
his
hands
according
to
the
order
of
God
,
to
preside
and
watch
over
.
the
church
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
-
did
not
belong
to
the
church
who
repented
.
of
their
sins
,
were
baptized
unto
repentance
,
and
were
receiyed
:
into
the
church
.
And
it
also
.
came
to
pass
that
whosoever
did
belong
to
the
church
,
that
.
did
not
repent
of
their
-
wickedness
,
and
humble
themselves
before
God
;
J
mean
those
who
were
lified
.
up
in
the
pride
of
their
hearts
;
the
same
.
were
rejected
,
and
their
names
were
blotted
out
,
that
.
their
names
.
were
not
numbered
among
those
of
the
righteous
;
and
thus
they
began
to
establish
the
order
of
the
church
in
the
city
of
Zarahemla
.
Now
I
would
that
ye
should
understand
that
the
word
of
God
was
liberal
untovall
;
that
none
were
deprived
of
the
privilege
of
assembling
themselves
together
to
hear
the
word
of
God
;
nevertheless
the
children
of
God
were
commanded
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
oft
,
and
join
in
fasting
and
mighty
prayer
,
in
behalf
of
the
welfare
of
the
souls
of
those
who
knew
not
God
,
:
And
now
it
came
to
pass
.
that
when
Alina
had
made
these
-
regulations
,
he
-
departed
from
them
,
yea
,
from
the
church
which
was
in
the
city
of
:
Zarahemla
,
and
went
over
npon
the
east
of
the
river
Sidon
,
into
the
valley
.
of
Gideon
,
there
.
having
been
a
city
built
which
was
called
the
city
of
Gideon
,
which
was
.
in
the
valley
thatowas
called
:
Gideon
,
being
called
after
the
man
st
was
slain
by
the
hand
:
of
Nebor
with
the
sword
,
And
Alma
went
and
began
to
declare
the
word
of
God
unto
the
church
which
was
-
established
:
in
the
-
valley
of
Gideon
;
according
to
:
the
revelation
of
the
trath
of
the
:
word
which
:-
lad
-
been
spoken
:
by
his
fathers
,
and
according
:
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy
which
was
:
in
him
,
actording
to
the
testimony
of
Jesus
Christ
,
the
Son
of
[File:252]
God
,
who
should
come
to
redeem
his
people
from
their
sins
;
and
the
holy
order
by
which
he
was
called
.
And
thus
it
is
written
.
'
Amen
:

CHAPTER
V
.
The
words
of
Alma
which
he
delivered
to
the
people
in
Gideon
,
according
to
his
own
record
.
Bruotp
my
beloved
brethren
,
seeing
that
I
have
been
permitted
to
come
unto
you
,
therefore
J
attempt
to
address
you
in
my
language
;
yea
,
by
my
own
mouth
;
seeing
that
it
is
the
first
time
that
I
have
spoken
unto
you
by
the
words
of
my
mouth
,
I
having
been
wholly
confined
to
the
judgment
seat
,
having
had
much
business
that
I
could
not
come
unto
you
;
and
even
I
could
not
have
.
come
now
at
this
time
,
were
it
not
that
the
judgment
seat
hath
been
given
to
another
,
to
reign
in
my
stead
;
and
the
Lord
in
much
mercy
hath
granted
that
I
should
come
unto
.
you
..
And
behold
,
I
have
come
having
great
hopes
and
much
desire
that
I
should
find
that
ye
had
humbled
vourselves
before
God
,
and
that
ye
had
continued
in
the
supplicating
of
his
grace
,
that
I
should
find
:
that
ye
were
blameless
before
him
;
that
I
should
.
find
that
ye
were
not
in
the
awful
dilemma
that
our
brethren
were
in
at
Zarahemla
;
but
blessed
be
the
name
of
God
,
that
he
hath
given
me
to
know
,
yea
,
hath
given
unto
me
the
exceeding
great
joy
of
knowing
that
they
are
established
again
in
the
way
of
his
.
righteousness
.
And
trust
,
according
to
the
spirit
of
God
which
is
in
me
,
that
I
shall
also
-
have
joy
over
you
;
nevertheless
I
do
not
desire
that
my
joy
over
you
,
should
come
by
the
cause
of
so
much
afilictionsand
:
sorrow
which
.
have
had
for
the
brethren
at
Zarahemla
:
for
behold
,
my
joy
,
corheth
over
them
after
wading
through
much
afilictionsand
sorrow
.
But
behold
,
I
trust
that
ye
are
not
inva
state
of
so
.
much
unbelief
as
were
your
:
brethren
:
I
trust
that
ye
are
not
lifted
-
up~in
the
pride
of
your
hearts
:
yea
,
I
trust
:
that
-
ye
have
not
set
-
your
hearts
upon
riches
,
and
the
vain
things
of
the
world
;
yea
;
I
trast
that
you
do
not
worship
idols
;
but
that
ye
do
worship
the
true
and
the
living
God
,
and
that
ye
look
forward
[File:253]
for
the
remission
-
of
your
sins
with
an
everlasting
faith
which
is
tocome
..
For
behold
,
Isay
.
unto
you
,
there
be
many
things
to
come
;
and
behold
,.
there
is
one
thing
which
is
of
more
importance
than
they
all
:.
for
behoid
,
the
time
is
not
far
distant
,
that
the
Redeemer
liveth
and
cometh
aimong
his
people
.
Behold
,
Ido
not
say
that
he
will
come
among
us
at
the
time
of
his
dwelling
in
his
mortal
tabernacle
;
for
behold
,
the
spirit
hath
not
said
unto
me
that
this
should
be
the
case
.
Now
as
to
this
thing
1
do
not
know
;
but
this
much
J
do
know
,
that
the
Lord
God
hath
power
to
do
all
things
which
are
according
to
his
word
.
But
.
behold
,
the
spirit
hath
said
this
inuch
unto
me
,
-
saying
:
cry
unto
this
people
,
saying
,
repent
ye
,
and
.
prepare
the
way
of
the
Lord
,
and
walk
in
his
paths
,
which
are
straight
:
for
behold
,
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
,
and
the
Son
of
God
cometh
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
.
And
behold
,
he
shall
be
born
of
Mary
,
at
Jerusalem
,
which
is
the
land
of
.
our
forefathers
,
she
being
a
virgin
,
a
precious
and
chosen
vessel
,
who
.
shall
be
overshadowed
,
and
conceive
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
and
bring
forth
a
son
,
yea
,
even
the
Son
of
God
;
and
he
shall
.
go
forth
,
suffering
pains
,
and
.
afflictions
,
and
temptations
of
every
kind
;
and
this
that
the
word
might
be
fulfilled
which
saith
,
he
will
take
upon
him
the
-
pains
and
the
sicknesses
of
his
people
;
and
he
will
take
upon
him
death
,
that
he
may
loose
the
bands
of
death
which
bind
his
people
:
and
he
will
take
upon
him
their
infirmities
,
that
his
bowels
may
be
filled
with
merey
,
according
to
the
flesh
.
that
he
may
know
according
to
the
flesh
how
to
succor
his
people
according
to
their
infirmities
.
Now
the
spirit
knoweth
all
things
;
nevertheless
the
Son
of
.
God
suffereth
according
to
the
flesh
,
that
he
might
take
upon
him
the
sinus
of
his
people
,
that
he
might
blot
out
their
transgressions
,
according
to
the
power
of
his
deliverance
;
and
now
behold
,
this
is
the
testimony
which
is
inme
.
Now
I
say
unto
you
,
that
ye
must
.
repent
,
and
be
burn
again
:
for
the
spirit
.
saith
,
if
ye
are'
not
born
again
,
ye
cannot
inherit
the
kingdom
of
:
heaven
;
therefore
come
and
.
be
baptized
:
unto
repentance
,
that
yemay
be
washed
from
.
your
.
sins
,
that
ye
may
have
.
faith
on
the
Lamb
of
;
God
,
who
taketh
away
the
sins
of
the
world
,
who
is
mighty
to
save
.
and
to'
cleanse
from
.
all
unrighteousness
;.
yea
,
I
gay
.
unto
you
,.
come
and
fear
not
,
and
lay
.
aside
every
.
sin
,
which
easily
doth
beset
you
,
which
doth
.
bind
you
down
todestrue
[File:254]
tion
;
yea
,
come
and
go
forth
,
and
shew
unto
your
God
that
ye
are
willing
to
repent
of
your
-
sins
,
and
enter
into
a
coyenant
with
him
-
to
keep
his
commandments
,
and
witness
it
unto
him
this
day
,
by
going
into
the
waters
of
baptism
;
and
whosoever
doetli
this
,
and
keepeth
the
commandments
of
God
.
from
thenceforth
,
the
same
will
remember
that
I
say
unto
him
,
yea
,
he
will
remember
that
1
have
said
unto
him
,
he
shall
have
eternal
life
;
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
Holy
Spirit
,
which
testifieth
in
me
.
And
now
my
beloved
brethren
,
do
-
you
believe
these
things
?
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
yea
,
I
know
that
ye
believe
them
;
and
the
way
that
I
know
that
yebelieve
them
,
is
by
the
manifestation
of
the
spirit
which
is
in
me
.
And
now
because
your
faith
is
strong
concerning
that
,
yea
,
concerning
the
things
which
I
have
spoken
,
great
ismy
joy

said
unto
:
you
from
the
beginning
,
that
I
had
much
desire
that
ye
were
not
in
the
state
of
dilemma
like
your
brethren
,
even
so
I
have
found
that
my
desires
have
been
gratified
...
For
{
perceive
that
ye
are
in
the
paths
of
righteousness
;
I
perceive
that
ye
arein
the
path
which
leads
to
-
the
Kingdom
of
God
;
yea
,
I
perceive
that
ye
are
making
his
paths
straight
;
I
perceive
that
it
has
been
made
known
unto
you
by
the
testimony
of
his
word
,
that
he
cannot
walk
in
crooked
paths
;
neither
doth
he
vary
from
that
which
he
hath
said
;
neither
hath
hea
shadow
of
turning
from
the
right
to
the
left
,
or
from
that
whichis
right
to
that
which
is
wrong
;
therefore
,
his
course
is
ohne
eternal
round
.
And
ie
doth
not
dwell
in
peren
temples
;
neither
can
filthiness
,
or
any
thing
which
is
unclean
be
received
into
the
kinggom
of
God
;
therefore
I
say
unto
.
you
,
the
time
shall
come
,
yea
,
and
it
shall
be
at
the
last
day
,
that
he
who
is
filthy
,
shall
remain
in
his
filthiness
.
And
now
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
have
said
these
things
unto
you
,
that
I
might
awaken
you
to
a
sense
of
your
duty
to
God
,
that
ye
may
walk'
blameless
:
before
him
;
that
ye
may
walk
after
the
holy
order
of
God
,
after
which
ye
have
been
received
.
'
And
now
I
would
that
ye
should
be
humble
,
and
be
submissive
,
vand
gentle
;
easy
to
be
entreated
;
full
of
patience
and
long
suffering
;
being
temperatein
all
things
;
being
diligent
in
keeping
the
conimandments
of
God
at
all
times
;
asking
for
whatsoever
things
ye
stand
in
need
,
both
spiritual
and
teniporal
;
always
returning
thanks
unto
God
for
whatedever
things
ye
do'
receive
,
[File:255]
and
see
that
ye
have
faith
,
hope
,
and
charity
,..
and
then
ye
will
always
abound
in
good
works
;
and
may
the
Lord
bless
you
,
and
keep
your
garments
spotless
,
that
ye
may
at
last
.
be
brought
to
sit
down
with
Abraham
,
Isaac
and
Jacob
,
-
and
the
holy
..
prophets
,
who
have
been
ever
since
the
world
began
,
having
your
garments
spotless
,
even
.
as
their
garments
are
spotless
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
,
to
go
no
more
out
.
And
now
my
beloved
brethren
,
]
have
spoken
these
words
unto
you
,
according
-
to
the
spirit
.
which
testifieth
in
me
;
and
my
soul
doth
exceedingly
:
rejoice
,-
because
of
the
exceeding
.
diligence
and
heed
which
ye
have
siven
unto
my
word
.
-
And
now
,
may
the
peace
of
God
rest
upon
you
,
and
upon
your

,
and
upon
your

and

,
and
all
that
you
possess
;
your

and
your
children
,
according
to
your

CHAPTER
VI
.
Anp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
returned
:
from
the
land
of
Gideon
,
after
-
having
taught
the
people
of
Gideon
many
things
which
cannot
be
written
,
having
established
the
order
of
the
church
,
according
as
he
had
before
done
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
yea
,
he
returned
to
his
own
house
at
:
Zarahemla
to
rest
himself
from
the
labors
which
he
hadxperformed
.
And
thus
ended
the
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
it
came
.
to
passin
the
commencement
ofthe
tenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
that
Alma
departed
:
from
thence
,
and
..
took
his
journey
cver
into
the
land
of
Melek
,
on
the
west
of
the
river
Sidon
,
on
the
west
,
by
the
borders
of
the
wilderness
:
and
he
began
to
teach
the
people
in
the
:
land
of
Melek
,
according
to
the
holy
order
of
God
.
by
which
he
had
been
called
;
and
he
began
to
teach'
the
people
throughout
all
the
land
of
Melek
,
veg
!
-
And
iteame
-
to
pass
thatthe
people
came
:
to
him
throughout
all
.
the
borders
of
the
land
which
was
by
the
wildernessside
...
And
they
:
were
:
baptized
through@utall
the
land
,
sothatwhenhe
had
finished
:
his
work
[File:256]
at
Melek
,
he
departed
thence
,
and
travelled
three
days'
journey
on
the
north
of
the
land
of
Melek
;
and
he
came
toa
city
which
was
called
Ammonihah
..
Now
it
was
the
custom
of
the
people
of
Nephi
,
to
call
their
lands
,
and
their
cities
,
and
their
villages
,
yea
,
even
all
their
small
villages
,
after
the
name
of
him
who
first
possessed
them
;
and
thus
it
was
with
the
Jand
of
Ammonihah
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Alma
had
come
to
the
city
of
Ammonihah
,
he
began
to
preach
the
word
of
God
unto
them
.
Now
satan
had
gotten
great
hold
upon
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
the
city
of
Ammonihah
;
therefore
they
would
not
hearken
unto
the
words
of
Alma
.
Nevertheless
Alma
labored
much
in
the
spirit
,
wrestling
with
Godin
mighty
prayer
,
that
he
would
pour
out
his
spirit
upon
the
people
who
were
in
the
city
;
that
he
would
also
grant
that
he
might
baptize
them
unto
repentance
;
nevertheless
,
they
hardened
their
hearts
,
saying
unto
him
,
behold
,
we
know
that
thou
art
Alma
;
and
we
know
that
thou
art
high
priest
over
the
church
which
thou
hast
established
in
many
parts
of
the
land
,
according
to
your
tradition
;
and
we
are
not
of
thy
church
,
and
we
do
not
believe
in
such
foolish
traditions
.
And
now
we
know
that
because
we
are
not
of
thy
church
,
we
know
that
thou
hast
no
power
over
us
;
and
thou
hast
delivered
up
the
judgment
seat
unto
Nephihah
;
therefore
thou
art
not
the
chief
judge
over
us
.
Now
when
the
people
had
said
this
,
and
bad
withstood
all
his
words
,
and
reviled
him
,
and
spit
upon
him
,
and
caused
that
he
should
be
cast
out
of
their
city
,
he
departed
thence
and
took
his
journey
towards
the
city
which
,
was
called
Aaron
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
while
he
was
journeying
thither
,
being
weighed
down
with
sorrow
,
wading
through
much
tribulation
and
anguish
of
soul
,
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
who
were
in
the
city
of
.
Ammonihah
,
it
came
to
pass
that
while
Alma
was
thus
weighed
down
with
sorrow
,
behold
an
angel
of
the
Lord
appeared
unto
him
,
saying
,
blessed
art
thou
,
Alma
;
therefore
lift
up
thy
head
and
rejoice
,
for
thou
hast
great
cause
to
rejoice
:
for
thou
hast
been
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
God
irom
the
time
which
thou
received
thy
first
message
from
him
.
Behold
,
I
am
he
that
delivered
it
unto
you
;
and
behold
,
I
am
sent
to
command
thee
that
.
thou
return
to
the
city
of
Ammonihah
,:
and
preach
again
unto
the
people
of
the
city
;
yea
,
preach
unto
them
,
..
Yea
,
say
unte
[File:257]
them
,
except
they
repent
,
the
Lord
God
will
destroy
them
.
.
For
behold
,
they
-
do
study
at
this
time
that
they
may
destroy
the
liberty
of
thy
people
,
(
for
thus
saith
the
Lord
,)
which
iscontrary
to
the
statutes
,
and
judgments
,
and
commandments
whieh
he
has
given
unto
his
people
.
,
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Alma
had
received
his
message
from
the
angel
of
the
Lord
,
he
returned
speedily
to
the
land
of
Ammonihah
.
And
he
entered
the
city
by
another
way
,
yea
,
by
the
way
which
is
on
the
south
of
the
city
of
Ammonihah
.
And
as
he
entered
the
city
he
was
.
an
hungered
,
and
he
said
toa
man
,
will
ye
give
to
an
humble
servant
of
God
something
to
eat
?
And
the
man
said
unto
him
,
I
am
a
Nephite
,
and
I
know
that
thou
art
a
holy
prophet
of
God
,
for
thou
art
the
man
whom
an
angel
said
ina
vision
,
thou
shalt
receive
;
therefore
go
with
me
into
my
house
,
and
will
impart
unto
thee
of
my
food
;
and
I
Loam
that
thou
will
be
a
blessing
unto
me
and
my
house
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
man
received
him
into
his
house
;
and
the
man
was
called
Amulek
;
a
he
brought
forth
bread
and
:
meat
,
and
sat
before
ma
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
ate
bread
and
was
filled
;
and
he
.
blessed
Amulek
and
his
house
,
-
and
he
gave
thanks
unto
God
.
-
And
after
he
had
eat
and
was
filled
,
he
said
unto
Amulek
,
Iam
Alma
,
and
am
the
high
priest
over
the
church
of
God
throughout
the
land
..
And
behold
,.
I
have
.
been
called
to
preach
:
the
word
of
God
among
all
this
.
people
;
according
to
.
-
the
spirit
of
revelation
and
prophecy
;
and
I
was
in
this
land
,
and
they
would
not
receive
me
,
but
they
cast
.
me
out
,
and
I
was
about
to
set
my
back
towards
this
land
forever
.
-
But
behold
,
I
have
been
commanded
.
that
I
should
turn
again
and
prophesy
unto
this
people
,
yea
,
and
to
testify
against
them
concerning
their
iniquities
.
And
now
Amulek
,-
because
thou
:
hast
fed
me
and
took
me
in
,
thou
art
blessed
:
for
I
was
an
hungered
,
for
had
fasted
many
days
:
And
:
Alma
tarried
many
days
.
as
Amulek
,
before
he
began
to
preach
unto
the
people
.
And
it
.
came
to
pass
:
thatthe
people
did
.
wax
more
gross
in
.
their
iniquities
,
-
And
the
.
word
came
to
Alma
,
saying
,
go
;
and
also
say
unto
my
servant
Amulek
,
go
forth
and
prophesy
unto
-
this
people
,
:
saying
,
repent
ye
,
for
thus
saith
the
Lord
,
except
ye
repent
,
I
will
.
visit
this
people
in
.
mine
anger
;..
yea
,
and]
.
will
[File:258]
not'
turn
my
fierce
anger
away
.
And
Alma
went
forth
,
and
also
Amulek
,
among
the
people
,
to
declare
the
words
of
God
unto
them
;
and
:
they'
were
:
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost
;
and
they
had
power
given
unto
them
,
insomuch
that
they
could
not
be
confined
in
dungeons
;
neither
were
it
possible
that
any
man
could
slay
them
;
nevertheless
they
did
not
exercise
tieir
power
until
they
were
bound
in
bands
and
cast
into
prison
.
Now
this
was
done
that
the
Lord
might
show
forth
his
power
in
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
forth
and
began
to
preach
and
to
prophesy
unto
the
people
,
according
to
.
the
spirit
and
.
power
whichthe
Lord
had
giver
them
,
CHAPTER
VII
.
The
words
of
Alma
,
and
also
the
words
of
Amulek
which
were
declured
unto
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
of
Ammonihah
.
And
also
they
are
cast
intoprison
,
and
delivered
by
the
miraculous
power
of
God
which
was
tn
them
,
according
to
the
recurd
of
Alma
.
Axp
again
:
I
Alma
,
having
been
commanded
of
God
that
IT
should
take
Amulek
and
go
forth
and
preach
again
unto
this
people
,
or
the
people
who
were
in
the
city
of
Ammonihah
,
it
came
to
pass
os
I
began
to
preach
unto
them
,
they
began
to
contend
with
me
,
saying
,
who
art
thou
?
Suppose
ye
that
we
shall
believe
the
testimony
of
one
man
,
although
he
should
preach
unto
us
that
the
earth
should
pass
away
?
Now
they
understood
not
the
words
which
they
spake
;
for
they
knew
not
that
the
earth
should
pass
away
.
And
they
said
also
,
we
will
not
believe
thy
words
,
if
thou
shouldst
prophesy
that
this
great
city
should
be
destroyed
in
one
-
day
.
Now
they
knew
not
that
God
could
do
such
marvelous
works
,
for
they
were
a
hard
hearted
and
a
stiffnecked
people
.
'
And
they
:
said
who
is
God
,
that
sendeth
no
more
authority
than
one
man
among
this
people
;
to
declare
unto
.
them
:
the
truth
of
such
great
and
marvelous
things
?
And
they
stood
:
forth
to
lay
their
hands
on
me
;
butbehold
,
they
did
not
And
I
stood
with
boldness
to
declareunto
them
,
[File:259]
yea
,
I
.
did
boldly
testify
.
unto'them
,;
saying
:
behold
,
O
ye
wicked
and
.
perverse
generation
,
how
have
ye
,
forgotten
the
tradition
of
your
fathers
;
yea
,
how
soon
:
ye
have
.
forgotten
.
the
commandmients
.
of
God
..
-
Do
ye
not
remember
that
our
father
Lehi
was
brought
.
out
of
Jerusalem
by
the
hand
of
God
?
.
Do
ye
not
.
remember
Â©
that
they
were
all
led
by
him
.
through
the
wilderness
?
And
-
have
ye
forgotten
so
.
scon
how
many
times
he
.
delivered
our
fathers
out
ofthe
hands
-
of
their
enemies
,
and
preserved
them
from
being
destroyed
,
even
by
the
hands
oftheir
own
brethren
?
Yea
,
andsif
it
had
not
been
for
his
matchless
.
power
,
and
his
mercy
,
and
his
long
suffering
towards
us
,
we
should
unavoidably
have
been
cut
off
from
the
face
of
the
earth
;
leng
before
this
period
of
time
,
and
perhaps
been
consigned
to
a
state
of
endless
misery
and
wo
.,
Behold
,
now
I
say
:-
unto
you
,
that
he
commandeth
you
to
repent
;
and
except
ye
repent
,
ye
can
in
.
no
wise
inherit
the
kingdom
of
God
.
Â©
But
behold
,
this
is
not
all
:
-
he
has
commanded
you
to
repent
,
or
he
will
utterly
destroy
you
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
;
yea
,
he
will
visit
you
in
his
anger
,
and
in
his
fierce
anger
he
will
not
turn
away
..
ehold
,
do
ye
not
.
remember
the
words
which
he
spake
unte
Lehi
,
saying
,
that
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
:
shall
.
prosper
in
the
land
?.,
And
again
it
is
said
,
that
inasmuch
as
:
ze
will
not
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
.
Now
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
,
that
inasmuch
as
the
Lamanites
have
not
kept
the
commandments
of
God
,
they
have
been
cut
.
off
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
...
Now
we
see
that
the
word
of
the
Lord
has
been
verified
in
this
thing
,
andthe
Lamanites
have
been
:
cutoff
from
his
presence
,
from
the
beginning
of
their
transgressions
in
the
.
land
..
Nevertheless
[
say
unto
you
,

I

that
if

that

and
it
shall
be
according
to
the
fierce
anger
of
the
Lord
;
for
he
will
not
suffer
you
that
ye
shall
live
in
your
iniquities
,
to
destroy
his
people
..
Isay
unto
you
,
nay
;
he
would
rather
suffer
that
the
Lamanites
might
destroy
all
this
people
who
are
called
the
people
of
Nephi
,
if
it
were
possible
that
they
could
fall
into
sins
and
transgressions
,
after
having
had
so
much
light
and
so
much
knowledge
given
unto
them
of
the
Lord
their
God
;
yea
,
after

that
which
has

with

And
now

I

unto

that
if

that

that

it
,
would
be
far
more
tolerable
for
the
Lamanites
than
for

For
behold
,
the
promises
of

the
Lord

are
extended
to
the
Lamanites
,
but
they'are

not

Andnow
for

destroyed
,
the
Lord
has
sent
his
angel
to
visit
many
of
his
people
,
declaring
unto
them
that
they
must
go
forth
and
cry
mightily
unto
-
this
people
,
saying
,
repent
ye
,
for
the
kingdom
of

is
nigh
at

;
and
not
many
days
hence
,
the
Son

of
God
shall
come
in
his
glory
;
and
his
glory
shall
be
the
glory
of
the
only
begotten
of
the
Father
,
full
of
grace
,
equity
and
truth
,
full
of
patience
,
mercy
,
and
long
suffering
,
quick
to
hear
the
cries
of
his
people
,
and
to
answer
their
prayers
.
And
behold
,
he
cometh
to
redeem
those
who
will
be
baptized
unto
repentance
,
through
faith
on
his
name
;
therefore
prepare
ye
the
way
of
the
Lord
,
for
the
time
is
at
hand
that
all
men
shall
reap
a
reward
of
Â©
their
works
,
according
to
that
which
they
haye
been
:
if
they
have
been
righteous
,
they
shall
reap
the
salvation
of
their
souls
,
according
to
.
the
power
and
deliverance
of
Jesus
Christ
;
and
if
they
have
been
evil
,
they
shall
reap
the
damnation
of
their
souls
,
according
to
the
power
and
captivation
of
the
devil
.
Now
behold
,
this
is
the
voice
of
the
angel
,
erying
unto
:
the
people
.
And
now
my
beloved
brethren
,
for
ye
are
my
brethren
,
and
ye
had
ought
to
be
beloved
,
and
ye
had
ought
to
bring
forth
works
which
are

meet
for
repent
:
ance
,
seeing
that
your
hearts
have
been
grossly
hardened
against
the
word
of
God
,
and
seeing
that
ye
are
a
lost
and
a
fallen
people
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
,
Alma
,
had
spoken
these
words
,
behold
,
the
people
were
wroth
with
me
,
because
I
said
unto
them
that
they
was
a
hardhearted
anda
stiffnecked
people
;
and
also
because
[
said
unto
them
that
they

were
alost
and
a
fallen

ple
,
they
were
angry
with
me
,
and
sought
to
lay
their
hands
upon
me
,
that
they
might
cast
me
into
prison
;
but
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
.
did
not
suffer
them
_
,
that
they
should
take
me
at
that
time
and
cast
me
into
prison
,

And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amulek
went
and
stood

forth
,
and
began
to
preach
unto
them
also
,
And
now
the
words
of
Amulek

nevertheless
a

CHAPTER
VIII
.
_
Now
these
are
the
words
which
Amulek
preached
unto
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
of
Ammonihah
,
saying
:
1am
Amulek
;
I
am
the
son
of
Giddonah
,
who
was
the
son
of
Ishmael
,
who
was
a
descendant
of
Aminadi
:
and
it
was
that
same
Aninadi
who
interpreted
the
writing
which
was
upon
the
wall
of
the
temple
,
which
was
written
by
the
finger
of
God
..
And
Aminadi
was
a
descendant
of
Nephi
,
who
was
the
son
of
Lehi
,
who
came
out
.
of
the
Jand
of
Jerusalem
,
who
was
a
descendant
of
Manasseh
,
who
was
the
son
of
Joseph
,
who
was
sold
into
Egypt
by
the
hands
of
his
brethren
.
And
behold
,
Iam
alsoa
man
of
no
small
reputation
among
all
those
who
know
me
;
yea
,
and
behold
,
[have
many
kindreds
and
friends
,
and
I
have
also
acquired
much
riches'by
-
the
band
of
my
industry
;
nevertheless
,
after
all
this
,
I
never
have
known
much
of
the
ways
of
the
Lord
,
and
his
mysteries
and
marvelous
power
.
I
said
I
never
had
known
much
of
these
things
;
but
behold
,
I
mistake
,
for
I
have
seen
much
of
his
mysteries
and
his
marvelous
power
;
yea
,
even
in
the
preservation
of
the
lives
of
this
people
;
nevertheless
,
I
did
harden
my
heart
,
for
I
was
called
many
times
,
and
I
would
not
hear
;
therefore
I
.
knew
concerning
these
things
,
yet
I
would
not
know
;
therefore
I
went
on
rebelling
against
God
,
in
the
wickedness
of
my
heart
,
even
until
the
fourth
day
of
this
seventh
month
,
which
is
in
the
tenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
.
As
I
was
journeying
to
see
a
very
near
kindred
,
behold
an
angel
:
of
the
Lord
appeared
unto
me
,
and
said
,
Amulek
,
return
to
thine
own
house
,
for
thou
shalt
feeda
prophet
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
a
holy
man
,
who
is
a
chosen
man
of
God
;
for
he
has
fasted
many
days
because
of
the
sins
of
this
people
,
and
he
is
an
hungered
,
and
thou
shalt
reccive
him
into
thy
house
and
feed
him
,
and
he
shall
-
bless
:
thee
and
thy
house
;
and
the
blessing
of
the
Lord
shall
rest
upon
thee
and
thy
house
.
And
it
came
to
=
that
I
obeyed
the
voice
of
the
angel
,
and
returned
towards
my
house
.
And
ag
I
was
unto
me
,
he
is
a
holy
man
;
wherefore
I
know
he
isa
holy
man
,
because
it
was
said
by
an
angel
of
God
..
Ea
a
AE
uaa
:
[File:263]
And
again
,
I
know
thatthe
things
whereof
he
hath
testified
are
true
:
for
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
as_
the
Lord
liveth
,
even
so
he
has
sent
his
angel
to
make
these
things
manifest
unto
me
;
and
this
he
has
done
.
while
this
Alma
hath
dwelt
at
my
house
;
for
behold
,
he
hath
blessed
mine
house
,
he
hath
blessed
me
,
and
.
my
women
,
and
my
children
,
and
my
father
,
and
my
kinsfolks
;
yea
,
even
all
my
kindred
hath
he
blessed
,
and
the
blessing
of
the
Lord
hath
rested
upon
us
ao
cording
to
the
words
which
he
spake
.
.
And
now
when
Amulek
had
spoken
these
words
,
the
people
began
to
be
astonished
,
seeing
there
was
.
more
than
one
witness
who
testified
of
the
things
whereof
they
were
accused
,
and
also
of
the
things
which
were
Lo
come
,
according
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy
which
wasin
them
;
nevertheless
,
there
were
some
among
them
who
thought
to
question
them
,
that
by
their
cunning
devices
they
might
catch
them
in
their
words
,
that
they
might
find
witness
against
them
,
that
they
might
-
deliver
them
to
the
judges
,
that
they
might
be
judged
according
to
the
law
,
and
that
they
might
be
slain
or
cast
into
prisan
,
according
to
.
the
crime
which
they
could
make
appear
,
or
witness
against
them
.
Now
it
was
those
men
who
sought
to
destroy
them
,
who
were
lawyers
,
who
were
hired
or
appointed
by
the
people
to
administer
the
law
at
their
times
of
trials
,
or
at
the
trials
of
the
crimes
of
the
people
,
before
the
judges
.
Now
these
lawyers
were
learned
in
all
the
.
arts
and
cinning
of
the
people
;
and_this
-
was
to
enable
them
that
they
might
be
skilful
in
their
profession
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
question
Amulek
,
that
thereby
they
might
make
him
crosa
his
words
,
or
contradict
the
words
which
he
should
speak
...
Now
they
knew
not
that
Amulek
could
know
of
their
designs
.
But
it
came
to
pass
as
they
began
to
question
him
,
he
perceived
their
thoughts
,
and
he
said
.
unto
them
,
O
ye
wicked
and
perverse
generation
;
+
ye
lawyers
and
hypocrites
:
for
ye
are
laying
the
foundations
of
the
devil
;
for
ye
are
laying
traps
and
snares
to
catch
the
holy
ones
of
God
;.
ye
are
laying
plans
te
pervert
the
ways
of
the
righteous
,
and
to
bring
down
the
wrath
of
Goi
upon
your

heads
,
even
to
the
utter

of

unto

who

in

that

And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
were
more
-
angry
with
Amulek
,
and
they
eried
out
saying
:
this
man
doth
revile
against
our
laws
,
which
are
just
,
and
our
wise
lawyers
whom
we
have
selected
.
But
AmuIek
stretched
forth
his
hand
,
and
cried
the
mightier
unto
them
,
saying
:
O
ye
wicked
and
perverse
generation
;
why
hath
satan
.
got
such
great
hold
upon
your
hearts
?
Why
will
ye
yield
yourselves
unto
him
that
he
may
have
power
over
you
,
to
blind
your
eyes
,
that
ye
will
not
understand
the
words
which
are
spoken
,
according
to
their
truth
?
For
behold
,
have
I

Ye
donot

;
ye
say
that
IT
have
spoken
against
your
law
;
but
I
have
not
;
but
{
have
spoken
in
favor
of
your
law
,
to
your
condemnation
.
And
now
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
the
foundation
of

And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Amulek
had
spoken
these
words
,
the
people
cried
out'against
him
,
zaying
,
now
we
know
that
this
man
isa
child
of
the
devil
,
for
he
hath
lied
unto
us
;
for
he
hath
spoken
against
our
law
.
'
And
now
he
says
that
he
has'
not
:
spoken
against
it
.
And
again
:
he
has
reviled
against
et
[File:265]
our
lawyers
,
and
our
judges
,
&c
.
Andit
came
to
pass
that
the
lawyers
put
it
into
their
hearts
that
they
should
remember
these
things
againsthim
.
And
there
was
on
?
among
them
whose
mame
was
Zeezrom
.
==
Now
he
was
the
foremost
to
accuse
Amulek
and
Alma
;
he
being
one
of
the
most
expert
among
them
,
having
much
business
to
do
among
the
people
.
Now
the
object
of
these
lawyers
was
to
get
gain
;
and
they
got
gain
according
to
their
employ
.
a
ay
Now
it
was
in
the
law
of
Mosiah
that
every
man
who
was
a
judge
of
the
law
,
or
those
who
were
appointed
to
be
judges
should
receive
wages
according
to
the
time
whieh
they
labored
to
judge
those
who
were
brought
before
them
to
be
judged
,
oe
Now
if
a
man
owed
another
,
and
he
would
not
pay
that
which
he
did
owe
,
he
was
complained
of
to
the
judge
;
and
the
judge
executed
authority
,
and
sent
,
forth
officers
that
the
man
should
be
brought
before
him
;
and
he
judged
the
man
according
to
the
law
and
the
evidences
which
were
brought
against
him
,
and
thus
the
man
was
compelled
to
pay
that
which
he
ow
:
ed
,
or
be
striped
,
or
be
cast
out
from
among
the
people
,
as
a
thiefand
arobber
,.
And
the
judge
received
for
his
wages
according
to
his
time
:
a
senine
of
gold
for
a
day
,
or
a
senum
of
silver
,
which
is
equal
to
a
senine
of
gold
;
and
this
is
according
to
the
law
which
was
given
...
Now
these
are
the
names
of
the
different
.
pieces
of
their
gold
,
and
of
their
silver
,
according
to
their
value
.
And
the
names'are
given
by
the
Nephites
;
for
they
did
not
reckon
after
the
manner
of
the
Jews
.
who
were
at
Jerusalem
;
neither
did
they
measure
af
)
{er
the
manner
of
the
Jews
,
but
they
altered
their
reckoning
and
their
measure
,
according
to
the
minds
.
and
the
circumstances
of
the
people
,
in
every
generation
,
until
the
reign
of
the
judges
;
they
having
been
established
by
king
Mosiah
.
Now
the
reckoning
is
thus
:
a
senine
of
gold
,
a
seon
of
gold
,
a
shum
of
gold
,,
and
a
limnah
of
gold
.
A
senum
of
silver
,
an
amnor
of
silver
,
an
ezrom
of
silver
,
and
an
onti
of
silver
.
~
A'
senum
of
silyer
was
equal
to
a
senine
of
gold
;
and
ei
-
'
ther
for
a
measure
of
barley
,
and
also
for
a
measure
of
every
,
kind
of
grain
.
Now
the
amount
of
,
a'seon''d
?
}
gold
,
was
twice
the
value
of
a
senine
;
and
a
shum
aa
gold
was
.
twice
the'
value
of
a
seon
;
and
a
limnah
o
gold
was
the
.
value
of
.
them
all
;
and
an
amnor
of
gilver
,
was
as
great
as
two
senums
;
and
an
ezrom
of
silVer
was
,
as
great'
ag
four
senums
;
and
an
onti
was
ai
[File:266]
greai
as
.
them
all
,
Now
this
is
the
value
of
the
lesser
numbers
of
their
reckoning
:
a
shiblon
is
half
of
a
senum
:
therefore
a
shiblon
for
half
a
measure
of
barley
;
and
a
shiblum
is
a
haif
of
a
shiblon
;
and
a
leah
is
the
half
ofa
.
shiblum
,
Now
this
is
their
number
,
according
to
their
reckoning
.
Now
an
antion
of
gold
is
equal
to
three
shublons
.
Now
it
was
for
the
sole
purpose
to
get
gain
,
because
they
received
their
wages
according
to
their
employ
;
therefore
they
did
stir
up
the
people
to
riotings
,
and
all
manner
of
disturbances
and
wickedness
,
that
they
might
have
more
employ
;
that
they
might
get
money
according
to
the
suits
which
were
brought
before
them
;
therefore
they
did
stir
up
the
people
against
Alma
and
Amulek
.
And
this
Zeezrom
began
to
question
Amulek
,
saying
:
will
ye
answer
me
a
few
questions
which
Tshall
ask
you
?)
Now
Zeezrom
was
aman
who
was
expert
in
the
devises
of
the
devil
,
that
he
might
destroy
that
which
was
good
;
therefore
he
said
unto
Amulek
,
will
ye
answer
the
questions
which
I
shall
put
unto
you
?
'
And
Amulek
said
unto
him
,
yea
,
if
it
be
according
to
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
,
which
is
in
me
;
for
[
shail
say
nothing
which
is
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
.
And
Dodson
said
unto
him
,
behold
,
here
is
six
onties
of
silver
,
and
all
these
will
I
give
thee
if
thou
wilt
deny
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being
.
Now
Amulek
said
,
O
thou
child
of
hell
,
why
tempt
ye
me
?
Knowest
thou
that
the
righteous
yieldeth
tono
such
temptations
?
Believest
thou
that
there
is
no
God
?
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
:
thou
knowest
that
there
is
a
God
,
but
thou
lovest
that
lucre
mors
than
him
.
And
now
thou
hast
lied
before
God
unto
me
..
Thou
saidst
unto
me
,
behold
these
six
onties
,
which
are
of
great
worth
,
I
will
give
unto
thee
,
when
thou
had
it
in
thy
heart
to
retain
them
from
me
;
and
it
was
only
thy
desire
that
I
should
deny
the
true
and
living
God
,
that
thou
mightest
have
cause
to
destro
me
.
And
now
behold
,
for
this
great
evil
thou
shalt
have
Ay
reward
.
And
Zeezrom
said
unto
him
,
thou
sayest
there
is
a
true
and
living
God
?
And
Amulek
said
,
yea
,
there
is
a
true
and
a
living
God
.
Now
Zeezrom
said
,
is
there
more
than
one
God
?
And
he
answereth
,
no
.
Now
Zeezrom
said
unto
him
again
,
how
knowest
thou
these
things
?
And
he
saidan
an
-
'
gel
hath
made
them
known
unto
me
.
And
Zeezrom
.
said
,
gain
,
who
is
he
that
shall
come
?
Is
it
the
son
ef
God
?
And
he
said
unto
him
,
yea
,
And
Zeezrom
Â§$
[File:267]
said
-
again
,
shall
he
save
his
people
in'their
sins
?
And
Amulek
answered
and
said
unto'him
,
Tsay
unto
you
he
shall
not
,
for
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
deny
his
word
,
Now
Zeezrom
said
unto
the
people
,
see
that
ye
remember
these'things
;
for
he
said
there
is
but
one
God
;
yet
he
saith
tbat
the
Son
of
God
shall
come
,
but
he
shall
not
save
his
people
,
as
though
he
had
authority
to
command
God
.
Now
Amulek
saith
again
unto
him
,
behold
thou
hast
lied
,
for
thou
sayest
that
1
spake
as
though
I
had
authority
to
command
God
,
because
J
said
he
shall
not
save
his
people
in
their
sins
.
And
I
say
unto
you
again
,
that
he
cannot
save
them
in
their
sins
:
for
I
cannot
deny
his
word
,
and
:
he
.
hath
said
that
no
unclean
thing
can
inherit
the
kingdom
of
heaven
;
therefore
how
.
can
ye'be
saved
,
except
ye
inherit
the
kingdom
of
heaven
?
Therefore
ye
cannot
be
saved
in
yoursins
.
Now
Zeezrom
saith
again
unto
him
,
is
the
Son
of
God
the
very
eternal
Father
?
And
Amulek
said
unto
him
,
yea
,
he
is
the
very
eternal
Father
of
heaven
and
of
earth
,
and
all
things
which
in
them
is
;
be
is
the
beginning
and
the
end
,
the
first
and
the
last
;
and
he
shall
come
into
the
world
to
redeem
his
people
;
and
he
shall
take
upon
him
the
transgressions
of
those
who
believe
on
his
name
;
and
these
are
they
that
shall
have
eternal
lite
,
and
salvation
cometh
to
none
else
:
therefore
the
wicked
remain
as
though
there
had
been
no
redemption
made
,
except
it
be
the
loosing
of
the
bands
of
death
;
for
behold
,
the
day
cometh
that
all
shall
rise
from
the
uead
and
stand
before
God
,
and
be
judged
according
to
.
their
works
..
Now
there
is
a
death
which
is
called
a
temporal
death
:
and
the
death
of
Christ
shall
loose
the
bands
of
this
temporal
death
,
that
all
shall
be
raised
from
this
temporal
death
;
the
spirit
and
the
body
shall
be
re
-
united
again
,
in
its
perfeet
form
;
both
limb
and
joint
shall
be
restored
to
its
proper
frame
,
even'
as
we
now
.
are
at
this
time
;
and
we
shall
be
brought
to
stand
before
God
,
'
knowing
-
even
as'
we
know
now
,
and
havea
bright
recollection
of
all
our
guilt
.
..
Now
:
this
restoration
shall
come
to
all
,
both
old
and
young
,
both
bond
and
free
,
both
male
.
and
.
female
,
both
the
wicked
and
the
righteous
;
and
even
there
shall
not
so
-
much
as
:
a
hair
of
their
-
heads
be
lost
;
but
all
things
shall'
becrestored
to
its
perfect
frame
,
as
it
is
now
,
orin
the
body
,
â
and
shall

be
brought
:
and
be
arraigned
before
the
bar
of
Christ
the
Son
,
and'
God
the
Father
,
and'
the
holy
[File:268]
Spirit
,
which
is
one
eternal
God
,
to
he
judged
according
to
their
works
,
whether
tuey
be
good
or
whether
they
be
evil
.
Now
behold
I
have
spoken
unto
you
concerning
the
death
of
the
mortal
body
,
and
also
concerning
the
resurrection
of
the
mortal
body
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
this
mortal
body
is
raised
to
an
immortal
body
;
that
is
from
death
;
even
from
thefirst
death
,
unto
life
,
that
they
can
die
no
more
;
their
spirits
uniting
with
their
.
bodies
,
never
to
be
.
divided
;
thus
the
whole
becoming
spiritual
and
immortal
,
that
they
can
no
more

:
Now
when
Amulek
had
.
finished
these
.
words
,..
the
people
began
again
to
be
astonished
,
and
also
Zeezrom
began
to
tremble
.
And
thus
ended
the
words
of
Amulek
,
or
this
is
all
that
I
-
have
written
,
..
CHAPTER
IX
.
Now
Alma
,
seeing
that
the
words
of
Amulek
.
had
silenced
.
Zeezrom
,
for
he
beheld
that
Amulek
had
caught
him
in
his
lying
and
deceiving
,
to
destroy
him
,
and
seeing
that
he
began
to
tremble
under
a
consciousness
of
his
guilt
,
he
opened
.
his
mouth
and
began
to
speak
unto
.
him
,
and
to
:
establish
the
words
of
Amulek
,
and
to
explain
things
beyond
,
or
to
unfold
the
scriptures
beyond
that
which
Amulek
had
-
done
.
Now
the
words
that
Alma
spake
unto
Zeezrom
,
were
heard
by
the
people
round
about
:
for
the
multitude
was
great
,
and
he
spake
on
this
wise
;
Now
Zeezrom
,
seeing
that
thou
hast
been
taken
.
in/thy
lying
and
,
craftiness
,
for
thou
hast
not
lied
:
unto
men
only
,
but
thou
hast
lied
unto
.
God
;
for
behold
,.
he
knows
all
thy
thoughts
;
and
thou
.
seest
that
thy
thoughts
are
made
known
unto
.
us
by
.
his
spirit
;:
and
thou
seest
that
we
know
that
thy
plan
was
a
very
subtle
.
plan
,
as
to
the
subtlety
of
the
devil
,
for
to
Jie
.
and
.
to
deceive
this
:
people
,
that
thou
mightest
set
.
them
against
us
,
to
revile
us
and
to
cast
us
out
.
Now
this
wasa
plan
of
thine
adversary
,
and
she
-
hath
exercised
his
,
power
.
in
.
thee
.
Now
I
would
.
that
.
ye
should
:
remiember
that
.
what
I
say
unto
.
thee
,
I
.
say
unto
.
all
.;
And
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
all
;
that
this
was
@
snare
.
of
:
the
.
adversary
,
which
[File:269]
he
has
laid
to
cateh
this
people
,
that
he
might
bring
you
into
sabjection
unto
him
,
that
he
might
encirele
you
about
with
his
chains
,
that
he
might
chain
yor
down
to
everlasting
destruction
,
according
to
the
power
of
bis
captivity
.
ae
Now
when
Alma
had
spoken
these
words
,
Zeezrom
began
to
tremble
more
exceedingly
,
for
he
was
convinced
more
and
more
of
the
power
of
God
;
and
he
was
also
convinced
that
Alma
and
Amulek
hada
knowledge
of
him
,
for
he
was
convinced
that
they
knew
the
thoughts
and
intents
of
his
heart
:
for
power
was
given
unto
them
that
they
might
,
know
of
these
things
,
according
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy
.
And
Zeezrom
beganto
inquire
of
them
diligently
,
that'
he
might'
know
more
concerning
the
kingdom
of
God
..
And
he
said
unto
Alma
,
what
does
this
mean
which
Amulek
hath
spoken
concerning
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
,
that
all
shall
rise
from
the
dead
,
both
the
just
and
the
-
wnjust
,
and
are
brought
to
stand
before
God
,
to
be
judged
according
to
their
works
?
And
now
Alma
began
to
expound
these
things
unto
him
,
saying
,
it
is
given
unto
many
to
know
the
mysteries
of
God
;
nevertheless
they
are
laid
under
a
strict
command
,
that
they
shall
not
impart
only
according
to
the
portion
of
his
word
,
which
he
doth
grant
unto
the
children
of
men
;
according
to'
the
heed
and
diligence
which
they
ive
unto
him
;
and
therefore
he
that
will
harden
his
eart
,
the
same
receiveth
the
lesser
portion
of
the
word
:
and
he
that
will
not
harden'
his
heart
,
'
to'
him
ia
given
the
gteater
portion
of
the
word
,
until
it
is
given
unto
him
to
know
the
mysteries
of
God
,
until
they
know
them
in
full
;
and
they
that
will
harden
their
hearts
,
to
them
is
given
the
lesser
portion
of
the
word
,
until
they
know
nothing
concerning
his
mysteries
:
and
then
they
are
taken
captive
by
the
devil
,
and
Jed
by
his
will
down
to
destruction
.
Now
this
is
what
is
meant
by
the
chains
of
hell
;
and
Amulek
hath
spoken
plainly
concerning
death
,
and
being
raised
from
this
mortality
to
a
state
of
immortality
,
and
:
being
brought
before
the
bar
of
God
,
to
be
judged
according
to
our
works
.
Then
if
our
hearts
have
been
hardened
,
yea
,
if
we
have
hardened
our
hearts
against
the
word
,
insomuch
that
it
has
not
been
found
in
ua
,
then
will
our
state
be
awful
,
for
then
we
shall

for

will
condemn
us
,
yea
,
all
our
works
will
condemn
us
;
we
shall
net
be
found
spotleas
;
and
our
thoughts
will
also
condemn
us
;
and
in
[File:270]
this
awful
state
,
we
shall
not
dare
look
up
ta
our
God
;
and
we
would
fain
be
glad
if
we
could
command
the
rocks
and
the
mountains
to
fall
upon
us
,
to
hide
us
from
his
presence
.
But
this
cannot
be
;
we
must
com

forth
and
stand
before
him
in
his
glory
,
and
in
his
power
,
and
in
his
might
,
majesty
,
aud
dominion
,
and
acknowledge
to
our
everlasting
shame
,
that
al]
his
judgments
are
just
;
that
he
is
justin
all
his
works
,
and
that
he
is
merciful
unto
the
children
of
men
,
and
that
he
has
all
power
to
save
every
man
that
belieyeth
on
his
name
,
and
bringeth
forth
fruit

for

.
And
now
behold
I
say
unto
you
,
then
cometh
8
death
,
even
a
second
death
,
which
is
aspiritual
death
;
then
is
a
time
that
whosoever
dieth
in
his
sins
,
as
to
a
temporal
death
,
shall
also
die
a
spiritual
death
:
yea
,
he
shall
die
as
to
things
pertaining
unto
righteous
.
ness
;
then
is
the
time
when
their
torments
shall
be
as
a
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
,
whose
flames
ascendeth
up
forever
and
ever
;
and
then
is
the
time
that
they
shall
be
chained
down
to
an
everlasting
destruction
,
according
to
the
power
and
captivity
of
satan
;
he
having
subjected
them
according
to
his
will
.
Then
I
say
unto
you
,
they
shall
be
as
though
there
had
been
no
redemption
made
;
for
they
cannot
be
redeemed
according
to
God's
justice
;
and
they
cannot
die
,
sees
ing
there
is
no
more
corruption
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Alma
had
made
an
end
of'speaking
these
words
,
the
people
began
to
be
more
astonished
;
but
there
was
one
Antionah
,
who
was
a
chief
ruler
among
them
,
come
forth
and
said
unto
him
,
what
is
this
that
thou
hast
said
,
that
map
should
rise
from
the
dead
and
be
changed
from
this
mortal
to
an
immortal
state
,
that
the
soul
can
never
diet
What
does
this
scripture
mean
,
which
saith
.
that
God
placed
cherubims
and
a
flaming
sword
on
the
east
of
the
garden
of
Eden
,
lest
our
first
parents
should
,
enter
and
partake
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life
,
and
live
forever
?
And
thus
we
see
tliat
there
was
no
possible
chance
that
they
should
live
forever
.
Now
.
Alma
said
unto
him
,
this
is
the
thing
which
I
was
about
to
explain
.
Now
we
see
that
Adam
did
fall
.
by
the
partaking
of
the
forbidden
fruit
,
according
to
the
word
of
God
;
.
and
thus
we
:
see
,
that
by
his
.
fall
,
all
mankind
became
a
lost
anda
fallen
people
.
And
now
behold
,
[say
unto
you
,
that
if
:
it
had
been
:
possible
:
for
Adam
to
have
partaken
:
of
the
fruit
of
the
tres

of
life
at
that
time
,
there
would
have
been
no
death
,
and
the
word
would
have
been
void
,
making
Goda
liar
:
for
he
said
,
if
thou
eat
,
thou
shall
surely
die
..
And
we
axe
that
death
comes
.
upon
mankind
,
yea
,
the
death
which
has
been
spoken
of
by
Amulek
,
which
is
the
temporal
death
;
nevertheless
there
was
a
space
nted
unto
man
,
in
which
he
might
repent
;
therefea
this
life
became
a
probationary
state
;
a
time
.
to
repare
to
meet
God
;
a
time
to
prepare
for
that
endess
state
,
which
has
been
spoken
of
by
us
,
which
is
after
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
.
Now
if
it
..
had
not
been
for
the
plan
of
redemption
,
which
was
Jaid
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
,
there
could
have
been
no
resurrection
of
the
dead
;
but
there
was
.
a
plan
of
redemption
laid
,
which
shall
bring
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
,
of
which
haa
been
spoken
.
And
now
behold
,
if
it
were
possible
that
our
first
parents
could
have
went
forth
and
partaken
of
the
tree
-
of
life
,
they
would
have
been
forever
miserable
,
having
no
preparatory
state
;
and
thus
the
plan
of
redemption
would
.
have
been
frustrated
,
and
the
word
-
of
God
would
have
been
void
,
taking
none
effect
,
But
behold
,
it
was
not
so
;.
but
it
was
appointed
unto
man
that
they
must
die
;
and
after
death
,
they
must
come
to
judgment
;
even
that
same
judgment
of
which
we
have
spoken
,
which
is
the
end
.
And
after
God
had
appointed
that
these
things
should
come
unto
-
man
,
behold
,
then
he
saw
that
it
was
expedient
that
man
should
know
concerning
the
things
.
whereof
he
had
appointed
unto
them
;
therefore
he
sent
angels
to
converse
with
them
,
who
caused
men
to
behold
of
.
hie
glory
.
And
they
began
.
from
that
time
forth
to
call
on
-
his
name
;.
therefore
God
conversed
with
men
;
and
made
known
unto
them
.-
the
plan
of
redemption
,
'
which
had
.
been
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
;
and
.
this
.
he
made
known
unto
them
according
to
their
faith
and
repentance
,
and
their
holy
works
;
wherefore
he
gave
commandments
unto
men
,
they
.
having
first
transgressed
the
first
commandments
as
to
things
which
were
temporal
,
and
becoming
as
gods
,
knowing
good
from
-
evil
,
placing
themselves
in
a
state
.
to
act
,
or
being
placed
ina
state
to
act
according
to
their
wills
and
.
pleasures
,
whether
to
do
evil
or
to
do
.
good
:
therefore
God
::
gave
.
unto
.
them
commandments
,
after
.
having
made
known
.
unto
-
them
the
plan
of
redemption
,
that
they
-
should
not
do
evil
,
the
penalty
thereof
:

death
,
which
was
an
everlasting
death
[File:272]
as
to

things
pertaining
unto
righteousness
;
for
on
such
the
plan
of
redemption
could
have
uo
power
,
for
the
works
of
justice
could
not
be
destroyed
,
according
to
the
supreme
goodness
of
God
.
But
God
did
call
on
men
,
inthe
name
of
his
Son
;
(
this
being
the
plana
ofredemption
:
which
was
laid
,)
saying
:

ye

and

then
will

I

therefore
,
whosoever

he
shall

;
unto

;
and
these'shall

And
whosoever
will

;
and
will
do

,
behold
,
I

that

And
now
my

,
behold

unto
you
,
that
if
ye
will
harden
your
hearts
,
ye
shall
not

;
therefore

;
therefore
,
according
to

,
unto

,
aswell
as

And
now
my

seeing'
we

know

these
things
;
andthey
are
true
;:
let
us

,
that
we
provoke

to

in'
these

which
he
has
given
unto

;
but
let
us
enter
into'the

rest

of
God
,
-
which
is
prepared
according
to

word
.
And
again
:
myâ
brethren
,
I
would
cite
your
minds'forward
to'
the
time
which
the
Lord
God
gave
these
:
commandments
unto
his'
children
;
and
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
the
Lord
God
ordained
priests
,
after
his
holy
order
,
which
was
after
the
order'of
his
Son
,
to
teach
these
.
things
unto
the
people
;
and
those
priests
were
ordained'
af
ter
the
order
of
his
Son
,
in'a
manner
that
thereby
the
poems
might
know
in
what
manner
to
look
forward
to
is
Son
for
redemption
,
And
thisis
the
manner
after
which
they
were
ordained
:
being
called
and
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
,
according
to
the
foreknowledge
of
God
,
on
account
of
their
exceeding
faith
and
good
works}
in
the
first
place
being
left
to
choose
good
or
evil
;
therefore
they
having
chosen
good
,
and
exercising
exceeding
great
faith
,
are
called
with
a
-
holy
calling
,
yea
,
with
that
holy
calling
which
was
prepared
:
with
,
and
.
according
to
,
'a
preparatory
redemption
for
such
;
and
thus
they
have
-
been
called
[File:273]
to
this
holy
calling
on
,
account
of
their
.
faith
,-
while
others
would
reject
the
spirit
of
God
on
account
.
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
and
blindness
of
their
.
minds
,
while
,
if
it
had
,
not
been
for
this
,
they
might
had
as
.
great
privilege
as
their
brethren
.
Or
in
fine
:.
in
the
first
.
place
they
were
on
the
same
-
standing
.
with
their
brethren
;
thus
this
holy
calling
being
prepared
from
the
foundation
.
of
the
world
for
such
as
would
.
not
harden
their
hearts
,
being
in
and
through
the
atonement
of
the
only
begotten
,
Son
,
who
.
was
prepared
;
and
thus
being
called
by
this
holy
calling
,
and
ordained
unto
the
high
priesthood
of
the
holy
order
of
God
,
to'teach
his
commandinents
unto
the
children
of
men
,
that
:-
they
.
jalso
,
might
enter
into
.
his
.
rest
,
this
high
priesthood
being
after
the
order
of
his
Son
,
which
order
was
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
:
or
in
other
words
,
being
without
beginning
of
days
or
.
end
of
years
,
being
:
prepared
from
eternity
to
all
eternity
,
according
to
his
foreknowledge
of
all
things
.
Now
,
they
were
ordained
after
this
manner
:
Being
called
witha
holy
calling
,
and
ordained
with
a
boly
ordinance
,
and
taking
upon
them
the
high

holy
order
,
which
calling
,
and
ordinance
,
and
.
high
priesthood
,
is
without

;
thus
they
become
high

forever
,
after
the
order
of
the
Son
,
the

only

of
the
Father
,
who

CHAPTER
X
.
Now
..
as
:
Isaid
-
concerning
the
holy
order
of
this
high
priesthood
:
there
were
many
who
were
ordained
and
became
high
priests
of
God
;
;
and
it
-
was
on
account
of
their
exceeding
faith
and
repentance
,
and
their
righteousness
.
before
..
God
,
they
:
choosing
to
repent
,
and
work
:
righteousness
,
rather
than
to
perish
;
therefore
they
-
were
called
:-
after
this
-
holy
,
order
,.
and
were\sanctified
;
and
their
-
garments
were
washed
white
,
through
the
blood
-
of
the
Lamb
.
Now
they
,
:
atter
.
being
sanctified
by
the
:
Holy
Ghost
,
having
:
their
garments
made
white
,
being
:
pure
and
spotless
before
God
,
couldnot
look
:
upon
siny
:
savecit
were
with
abhorrence
;
and
there
[File:274]
were
many
,
exceeding
great
many
,
who
were
made
pure
,-
and
entered
into
the
rest
of
\he
Lord
their
:
God
,
And
now
,
my
brethren
;
T
would
that
ye
should
humble
yourselves
.
beore
God
,
and
bring
forth
fruit
meet
for
repentance
,
that
ye
may
also
enter
into
that
rest
;
yea
,
humble
.
yourselves
even
as
the
people
in
the
days
of
Melchizedek
,
who
was
also
a
high
priest
after
this
same
order
which
I
have
spoken
,
who
also
took
upon
him
the
high
priesthood
forever
.
And
it
was
this
same
Melchizedek
to
whom
Abraham
paid
tithes
:
yea
,
even
our
father
Abraham
paid
tithes
of
one
tenth
part
of
all
he
possessed
,
Now
these
ordinances
were
given
after
this
manner
,
that
thereby
the
people
.
might
look
forward
on
the
Son
of
God
,
it
being
a
type
of
his
order
,
or
it
being
his
order
;
and
this
,
that
they
might
look
forward
to
him
for
a
remission
of
their
sins
,
that
they
might
enter
into
the
rest
of
the
Lord
.
Now
this
Melchizedek
was
a
king
over
the
land
of
Salem
;
and
his
people
had
waxed
strong
in
iniquity
and
abominations
;
yea
,
they
had
all
gone
astray
:
they
were
full
of
all
manner
of
wickedness
:
but
Melchizedek
having
exerciyed
mighty
faith
,
and
received
the
office
of
the
high
priesthood
,
according
to
the
holy
order
of
God
,
did
preach
repentance
unto
his
people
..
And
behold
,
they
did
repent
;
and
Melchizedek
did
establish
peace
in
the
land
in
his
days
;
therefore
he
wae
called
the
prince
of
peace
;
for
he
was
the
king
of
Salem
;
and
he
did
reign
under
his
father
.
Now
there
were
many
before
him
,
and
also
there
were
many
afterwards
,
but
none
were
preater
;
therefore
of
him
they
have
more
particularly
made
mention
.
Now
I
need
not
rehearse
the
matter
;
what
I
have
said
,
may
sufice
.
Behold
,
the
scripturesare
before
you
;
if
ye
will
wrest
them
it
shall
be
to
your
own
destruction
.
_
And
now
it
caine
to
pass
that
when
Alma
had
said
these
-
words
unto
them
;
he
stretched
forth
:
his
hand
unto
them
and
cried
with
a
mighty
.
voice
,
saying
,
now
ia
the
time
to
repent
,
for
the
day
ofisalvation
draweth
nigh
:
yea
,
and
the
voice
of
the
Lord
,
by
the
mouth
of
angels
,
doth
declare
it
:
unto
all
nations
:
yea
,
doth
declare
it
,
that
they
may
have
glad
tidings
of
great
joy
:
ea
,
and
he
doth
sound
these
glad
tidings
among
all
is
people
,
yea
,
even
to
them
that
are
scattered
abroad
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
;
wherefore
they
have
come
unto
us
.
And'they
are
made
known
;
unto
.
us
in
plain
terms
,
that
:
we
may
understand
,
that
:
we
:
cannot'err
;
and
this
because
of
our
being
wanderers
in
-
a
strange
[File:275]
land
;
therefore
we
are
thas
highly
favored
,
for
we
have
these
glad
tidings
declared
unto
us
in
all
parts
of
our
vineyard
.
For
behold
,
angels
are
declaring
it
unto
many
at
this
time
in
our
land
;
and
this
is
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
to
receive
his
word
,
at
the
time
of
his
coming
in
his
glory
.
And
now
we
only
wait
to
hear
the
joytul
news
eclared
unto
us
by
the
mouth
of
angels
,
of
his
comcd
for
the
time
cometh
,
we
kno
v
not
how
soon
..
ould
to
God
that
it
might
be
in
my
day
;
butet
it
-
be
sooner
or
later
,
in
it
I
will
rejoice
.
And
it
shall
be
made
known
unto
just
and
holy
men
,
by
the
mouth
of
angels
,
at
the
time
of
his
coming
,
that
the
words
of
our
fathers
may
be
fulfilled
,
according
to
that
which
they
have
spoken
concerning
him
,
which
was
accord+
ing
to
the
spirit
of
prophecy
which
was
in
them
,
And
now
my
brethren
,
I
wish
.
from
the
inmost
part
of
my
heart
,
yea
,
with
great
anxiety
,
even
unto
pain
,
that
ye
would
hearken
unto
my
words
,
and
cast
off
your
sins
,
and
not
procrastinate
the
day
of
your
repentance
;
but
that
ye
would
humble
yourselves
before
the
Lord
,
and
call
on
his
holy
name
,
and
watch
and
pray
continually
,
that
ye
may
not
be
tempted
above
that
which
ye
can
bear
,
and
thus
be
led
-
by
the
holy
epirit
,
becoming
humble
,
meek
,
submissive
,
patient
,
full
of
love
and
all
long
suffering
;
having
faith
on
the
Lord
;
having
a
hope
that
ye
shall
receive
eternal
life
:
having
the
love
of
God
always
in
your
hearts
,
that
ye
may
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
,
and
enter
into
his
rest
:
and
may
the
Lord
grant
unto
you
repentance
,
that
ye
may'
not
bring
down
his
wrath
upon
you
,
that
ye
may
not
be
bound
down
by
the
chains
of
hell
,
that
ye
niay
not'suffer
the
second
death
.
And
Alma
-
spake
many
more
words
unto
the
people
,
which
are
not
writtenin
this
book
,
And
it
came
to
pass
afterhe
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
unto
the
people
,
many
of
them
did
-
believe
on
his
words
,
and
began
to
repent
,
and
to
search
the
scriptures
;
but
the
anore
part
of
them
were
desirous
that
they
might
destroy
Alma
and
Amulek
:
for
they
Were
angry
with
Alma
,
because
of
the
plainness
of
his
words
onto
Zeezrom
;
and
they
also
said
that
Amulek
had
lied
unto
them
,
and
had
reviled
against
their
law
,
and
also
against
their
lawyers
and
judges
.
And'
they
were
also
angry
with
Alma
and'
Amulek
;
and
because
they
had
testified
so'
plainly
against
their
wickedness
,
they
sought
to
put
them
away
.
privily
.
[File:276]
But
itcame
.
to
pass
that
they
did
not
;
but
they
took
them
.,
and
bound
them
with
.
strong
cords
,
and
.
took
them
:
besore
the
chief
judge
of
theland
.
And
ihe
pzople
went
forth
and
witnessed
.
against
them
,
testifying
that
they
had
.
reviled
against
the
law
,
and
their
law
-.
yers
and
judges
of
the
land
,
and
also
of
,
all
the
people
that
were
in
the
land
;
and
also
testified
that
there
was
but
-
one
God
,
and
that
he
should
send
.
his
.
Son
among
the
people
,
but
he
should
not
save
them
;
and
,
many
such
things
did
the
people
testify
against
Alma
and
Amulek
.
.
Now
this
was
done
before
the
chief
judge
.
of
the
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Zeezrom
was
astonished
at
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
;
and
.
he
also
-
knew
concerning
the
blindness
of
the
minds
which
he
had
caused
among
the
people
,
by
his
lying
words
;.
and
his
soul
began
to
be
harrowed
up
,
undera
consciousness
of
his
own
.
guilt
;
yea
,:
he
.
began
to
be
encircled
,
about
by
,
the
pains
of
hell
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
began
to
cry
.
unto
the
people
,
saying
:
Behold
,
I
am
gaily
,
and
these
men
are
spotless
before
.
God
.
And
he
began
.
to
.
plead
for
them
,
from
that
time
forth
;
but
they
piled
him
,
saying
:
Art
.
thou
also
possessed
with
.
the
,
devil
?
And
they
spit
upon
him
,
and
cast
him
.
out
.
from
,
among
them
,
and
also
,
all
those
who
believed
.
in
the
.
words
which
had
.
been
,
spoken
by
Alma
and
Amulek
;
and
they
cast
.
them
out
,
and
sent
.
men
to
cast
stones
at
them
.
And
they
brought
.
their
.
wives
.
and
children
toaa
and
whosoever
believed
or
had
.
been
taught
to
elieve
in
the
word
of
God
,
they
caused
that
they
should
:
be
.
cast
into
.
the
fire
;
and
.
they
.
also
brought
forth
their
records
which
contained
the
holy
scriptures
,
and
cast
.
them
into
the
fire
also
,
that
,
they
might
be
burned
and
destroyed
by
fire
.
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
Alma
and
AmuIek
,
and
-
carried
them
forth
to
the
place
,
of
anartydom
,
that
they
might
,
witness
the
destruction
of
those
who
were
-
consumed
by
fire
...
And
.
when
:
Amulek
saw
the
pains
of
the
women
and
children
who
were
consuming
in
.
the
;
fire
,
he
was
also
pained
;
and
he
said
unto
Alma
,
how
.
can
.
we
witness
this
awful
seene
?.
Therefore
let
us
stretch
forth

that

may

acedrding
to

that

Now
Amulek

~
Now
it'ame
to
pass
that
when
the
bodies
of
those
who
had
-
been
cast
into
the
fire
,
were'
consumed
,
and
also'the
records
which
were
cast
in'
with
them
,
the
chief
judge
of
the
land
came
and
stood
before
Alma
and
Amulek
,
as
they
were
bound
;
and
he
smote
them'with
his
hand
upon
their
cheeks
,
and
said
unto
them
,
after
what
ye
have
seen
,
will'ye
preach
again
unto
this'
people
,
that
:
they
shall'
be
cast
into
a
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
?
Behold
,
ye
see
that
ye
had'not
power
to
save
these
who
had
been
cast
into
the
fire
;
neither
has
God
saved
them
,
because
they
were
of
thy
faith
.
And
the
judge
smote
them
again
upon
their
cheeks
,
and
asked
,
what
say
ye
foryourselves
?
.
Now
this
judge
was
after
the
order
and
faith
of
Nehor
,
who
slew'
Gideon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
and
Amulek
answered
him'nothing
;
'
and'
lve
smote
themagain
,
and
delivered
themto
the
officers
to
be
cast'into
prison
.
And
when
they
had
been
castinto
prison
three
days
,
there'came
many
lawyers
,
and
judges
,
and
.
priests
,
and
teachers
,
who
were
of
the
profession
of
Nehor
;
and
they
came
inunto
the
prison
to
see
them
,
and
they
questioned
them
about
many
words
;
but
they
answered
them
nothing
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
judge
stood
beforethem
,
and
said
,
why
do
ye
not
answer
the
words
of
this
people
?
'
Know
ye
not
that
I
have
power
to
deliver
ye
up
unto
the
flames
?
And
he
commanded
them
to
speak
;
but
they
answered
nothing
.
And
it
came'to
pass
that
they
departed
and
went
\heir'
ways
,
but
came
again
on
the
morrow
;
and
the
jadge
also
smote
them
again
on
their
cheeks
.
And
many
came
forth
also
,
and
smote
them
,
'
saying
,
will
7
stand
again
and
judge
this
people
,
and
condemn
our
jaw
?
If
ye
have
such
great
power
,
why
do
ye
not
:
deliver
yourselves
?
'
And
many
such
things
-
did
they
say
anto
them
,
gnashing
their
teeth
upon
them
,
and
spitting
upon
oni
,
and
saying
;
how'shall
we
look
when
we
are
damned
?
And
many
such
things
,
'
yea
,
all
manner
of
such
things
did'they
say
unto
them}
and
[File:278]
thus
they
did
.
mock
them
,
for
many
days
.
And
they
did
withhold
food
from
them
,
that
they
might
hunger
,
and
water
,
that
they
.
might
thirst
;
and
they
also
did
take
trom
them
their
clothes
,
that
they
were
naked
;
and
thus
they
were
bound
with
strong
cords
,
and
cons
fined
in
prison
.
And
it
came
to
pass
after
they
had
thus
suffered
for
many
days
,
(
and
it
was
.
on
the
twelfth
day
,
in
the
tenth
month
,
in
the
tenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,)
that
the
chief
judge
over
the
land
of
Ammonihah
,
and
many
of
their
teachers
and
their
lawyers
,
went
in
unto'the
prison
where
Alma
and
-
Amulek
were
bound
with
cords
...
And
the
chief
judge
stood
before
them
,
and
smote
them
again
,
and
said
unto
them
,
if
ye
have
the
power
of
God
,
de
liver
yourselves
from
these
bands
,
and
then
we
will
believe
that
-
the
Lord
will
destroy
this
people
accordding
to
your
words
.
..
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
all
went
forth
.
and
smote
them
,
saying
the
same
words
,
ven
until
the
last
;
and
when
the
last
had
spoken
unto
them
;
the
power
of
God
wag
upon
Alma
and
Amulek
,
and
they
arose
and
.
stood
:
upon
-
their
feet
;
and
Alma
eried
,
saying
,
how
long
-.
shall
we
suffer
these
.
great
afflictions
;
O
Lord
?
.
O
Lord
,
give
us
strength
according
to
our
faith
,
which
isin
.
Christ
,
even
unto
.
deliverance
;
and
they
break
the
.
cords
with
which
they
were
bound
:
and
when
the
people
saw
this
,
they
began
to
flee
,
for
the
fear
of
destruction
had
come
upon
them
.
And
it
caine
to
pass
that
so
great
was
their
fear
,
that
they
fellto
the
earth
,
and
did
not
obtain
the
outer
door
of
the
prison
;
and
the
earth
shook
mightily
,
and
the
-
walls
of
the
prison
were
rent
in
twain
,
so
that
they
fell
:
to
the
earth
;
and
the
chief
judge
,
and
the
Jawyers
,
and
priests
,
and
teachers
who
smote
.
upon
Alma
.
and
Auulek
,
were
slain
by
the
fall
thereof
.
And
Alina
and
A
:
nulek
-
came
fort
out
of
the
prison
,
and
they
were
not
hurt
:
for
the
Lord
had
granted
unto
them
power
,
acecording
to
their'
faith
which
was
in
Christ
.
.
And
they
straigitway
caine
forth
out
of
the
prisoa
;-
and
they
were
loosed
from
their
bands
;
and
the
prison
had
fallen
to
the
earth
,
and
every
soul
who
was
,
within
.
the
.
walls
:
thereof
,
save
it
.
were
Alina
and
Amulek
,
were
slain
:
and
they
straightway
came
forth
into
the
city
.
Now
the
:
people
having
heard
a
great
noise
,
camerunuing
together
by
.
multitades
,
to
know
.
the
,
cause
of
-
it
:
and
.
when
.
they
.
saw/Alima
and
Amulek
coming
forth
out
of
.
the
prison
;
and
,
the
walls
[File:279]
thereof
had
fallen
to
the
earth
,
they
were
struck
with
reat
.
fear
,
and
fled
from
the
presence
of
Alma
and
Fnmink
,
even
as
a
goat
fleeth
with
her
young
from
two
lions
;
and
thus
they
did
flee
from
the
presence
of
Alma
and
Amulek
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
and
Amulek
were
commanded
to
depart
out
of
that
city
;
and
they
departed
,
and
came
out
even
into
the
land
of
Sidom
;
and
behold
,
there
they
found
all
the
people
who
had
departed
out
of
the
land
of
Aimmonihah
,
who
had
been
cast
out
and
stoned
,
because
they
believed
in
the
words
of
Alma
.
And
they
related
unto
them
all
that
had
happened
unto
their
wives
and
children
,
and
also
concerning
themselves
,
and
of
their
power
of
deliverance
..
And
also
Zeezrom
lay
sick
at
Sidom
,
witha
burning
fever
;
which
was
caused
by
the
great
tribulations
of
his
.
mind
,
on
account
of
his
wickedness
,
for
he
supposed
that
Alma
and
Amuiek
were
no
more
;
and
he
supposed
that
they
had
been
slain
,
by
the
cause
of
his
iniquity
.
And
this
great
sin
,
and
his
many
other
sins
,
did
harrow
up
his
mind
until
it
did
become
exceeeding
sore
,
having
no
deliverance
;
therefore
he
began
to
be
scorched
with
a
burning
heat
.
Now
when
he
heard
that
Alma
and
Amulek
were
in
the
land
of
Sidom
,
his
heart
began
to
take
courage
;
and
he
sent
a
message
immediately
unto
them
,
desiring
them
to
come
unto
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
immediately
,
obeying
the
message
which
he
had
sent
unto
them
;
and
they
went
in
unto
the
house
unto
Zeezrom
;
and
they
found
him
upon
his
bed
.
sick
,
being
very
low
with
a
burning
fever
;
and
his
mind
also
was
exceeding
sore
,
because
of
his
iniquilies
;
and
when
he
saw
them
,
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
,
and
besought
them
that
they
would
heal
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
said
unto
him
,
taking
him
by
the
hand
,
believest
thou
in
the
power
of
Christ
unto
salyation
?
And
he
answered
and
said
,
yea
,
I
believe
all
the
words
that
thou
hast
taught
.
And
Alma
said
,
if
thou
believest
in
the
redemption
of
Christ
,
thou
canst
behealed
.
And
hesaid
,
yea
,
I
believe
according
to
thy
words
.
And
then
Alma
cried
unto
-
the
Lord
,
saying
,
O
Lord
our
God
,
have
mercy
on
this
man
,
and
heal
-
him
according
to
his
.
faith
which
is
in
Christ
.
And
when
.
Alma
had
said
.
these
words
,
Zeezrom
jeaped
upon
his
feet
,
and
began
to
walk
;
and
this
was
done
[File:280]
to
the
great
astonishment
of
all
the
people
;
and
the
knowledge
of
this
went
forth
throughout
all
the
land
of
Sidom
.
And
Alma
baptized
Zeezrom
unto
the
Lord
;
and
he
began
from
that
time
forth
to
preach
unto
the
people
.
And
Alma
established
a
church
in
the
land
of
Sidom
,
and
consecrated
priests
and
teachers
in
the
land
,
to
baptize
unto
the
Lord'
whosoever
were
desirous
to
be
baptized
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
many
;
for
they
did
flock
in
from
all
:
the
region
round
about
Sidom
,
and
were
baptized
;
but
as
to
the
people
that
were
in
the
land
of
Ammonihah
,
theyyet
remained
:
a
hard
hearted
and
a
stiffnecked
people
;
and
they
repented
not
of
their
sins
,
ascribing
all
the
power
of
Alma
and
Amulek
to
the
devil
:
for
they
were
of
the
profession
of
Nehor
,
and
did
not
believe
in
the
repentance
of
their
sins
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
and
Amulek
,
Amulek
having
forsaken
all
his
gold
,
and
silver
,
and
his
precious
things
,
which
were
in
the
land
of
Ammonihah
,
for
the
word
of
God
,
he
being
rejected
by
those
who
were
once
his
friends
,
and
also
by
his
father
and
his
kindred
;
therefore
,
after
Alina
having
established
the
church
at
Sidom
,
seeing
a
great
check
,
yea
,
seeing
that
the
people
were
checked
as
t
the
pride
of
their
hearts
,
and
began
to
humble
themselves
before
God
,
and
began
to
assemble
themselves
together
at
their
sanctyaris
to
worship
God
before
the
altar
,
watching
and
praying
continually
,
that
they
might
be
delivered
from
satan
,
and
from
death
,
and
from
destruction
;
Now
as
I
said
,
Alma
having
seen
all
these
things
,
therefore
he
took
Amulek
and
came
over
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
took
him
to
his
own
house
,
and
did
administer
unto
him
in
his
tribulations
,
and
strengthened
him
in
the
Lord
.
And
thus
ended
the
tenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
.
CHAPTER
XI
.
Axp
it
came
to
pass
in
the
eleventh
year
of
the
rei
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
on
the
day
of
the
second
.
month
,
there
having
been
much
peace
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
there
haying
been
.
no
[File:281]
wars
nor
contentions
for
a
certain
number
of
years
;
even
until
the
fifth
day
.
ofthe
second
month
,
in
the
eleventh
year
,
there
was
a
cry
of
war
heard
throughout
the
land
;
for
behold
,
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
had
come
in
upon
the
wilderness
side
,
into
the
borders
of
the
land
,
even
into
the
city
of
Ammonihah
,
and
began'to
slay
the
people
,
and
destroy
the
city
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
before
the
Nephites
could
raise
a
sufficient
army
to
drive
them
out
of
the
land
,
they
had
destroyed
the
people
who
were
in
the
city
of
Ammonihah
;
and
also
some
around
the
borders
of
Noah
,
and
taking
others
captive
into
the
wilderness
,
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
were
desirous
to
obtain
those
who
had
been
carried
away
captive
into
the
wilderness
;
therefore
he
that
had
been
appointed
chief
captain
over
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
,
(
and
his
name
was
Zoram
,
and
he
had
two
sons
,
Lehi
and
Aha
:)
Now
Zoramand
his
two
sons
,
knowing
that
Alma
was
high
priest
over
the
church
,
and
having
heard
that
he
had
the
spirit
of
prophecy
,
therefore
they
went
unto
him
and
desired
of
him
to
know
whether
the
Lord
would
that
they
should
go
into
the
wilderness
in
search
of
their
brethren
,
who
had
been
taken
captive
by
the
Lamanites
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
inquired
of
the
Lord
concerning
the
matter
.
And
Alma
returned
and
said
unto
them
,
behold
:
the
Lamanites
will
cross
the
river
Sidon
in
the
south
wilderness
,
away
up
beyond
the
borders
ot
the
land
of
Manti
.
And
behold
there
:
shall
ye
meet
them
,
on
the
east
of
the
river
Sidon
and
there
the
Lord
will
deliver
unto
thee
thy
brethren
who
have
been
taken
captive
by
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
-
to
pass
that
Zoram
and
his
sons
crossed
over
the
river
Sidon
,
with
their
armies
,
and
marched
away
beyond
:
the
borders
of
Manti
,
into
the
south
wilderness
,
which
was
on
the
eastside
of
the
river
Sidon
.:.
And
.
they
came
upon
the
armies
of
the
La
manites
,
andthe
Lamanites
were
scattered
and
driven
-
into
the
wilderness
;
that
they
took
their
brethren
who
had
been
taken
captive
by
the
Lamanites
,
and
there
was
not
:
one
soul
of
them
-
who
had
been
lost
,
that
were
taken
captive
..
And
:
they
were
brought
by
their
brethren'to
:
possess
their
own
.
lands
;.
And
.
thus
:
ended
the
eleventh
year
of
the
judges
;
the
Lamanites
having
been
driven
out
-
of
the
land
,
and
,
the
people
of
:
Ammonihah
were
destroyed
;
yea
,
every
living
soul
of
the
Ammonihuhits
:
were
destroyed
,
and
-
also
their
great
city
,
which
[File:282]
they
said
God
could
:
not
destroy
,-
because
.
of
its
greatness
.
But
behold
,
in
one
day
.
it
was
left
.
desolate
;
and
.
the
carcases
.
were
mangled
by
dogs
and
wild
beasts
of
the
wilderness
;
nevertheless
,
after
many
days
,
their
dead
bodies
were
heaped
up
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
,
and
they
were
covered
with
a
-
shallow
covering
.
And
now
so
great
was
the
scent
thereof
,
that
the
people
did
not
go
in
to
possess
the
land
of
Ammonihah
for
many
years
.
And
it
was
called
desolation
-
of
Nehors
;
for
they
.
were
of
the
profession
of
Nehor
,
who
were
slain
;
and
their
lands
remained
desolate
.
And
the
Lamanites
did
not
come
again
to
war
against
the
Nephites
until
the
fourteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
thus
for
three
years
did
the
people
of
Nephi
have
continual
peace
in
all
the
land
.
And
Alma
and
Amulek
went
forth
preaching
repentance
to
the
people
in
their
temples
,
and
.
in
their
sanctuaries
,
and
also
in
their
synagogues
,
which
were
built
after
the
manner
of
the
Jews
.
And
as
many
as
would
hear
their
words
,
unto
them
they
did
impart
the
word
.
of
God
,
without
any
respect
of
persons
,
continually
,
And
thus
did
Alma
and
Amulek
..
go
forth
,
and
also
.
many
more
who
had
been
chosen
for
the
work
,
to
preach
the
word
throughout
.
all
the
land
,
And
the
establishment
of
the
church
became
general
throughout
the
land
,
.
in
all
the
region
round
about
,
among
all
the
people
of
the
Nephites
.
And
there
was
no
inequality
among
them
,
the
Lord
did
pour
out
his
spirit
on
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
to
prepare
the
minds
of
the
children
of
men
,
or
to
.
prepare
their
hearts
to
receive
the
word
which
should
be
.
taught
among
them
at
the
time
of
his
coming
,
that
they
might
not
be
hardened
against
the
word
,
that
they
might
not
be
unbelieving
,
and
go
on
to
destruction
,
but
that
they
might
receive
the
word
with
joy
,
and
as
a
branch
be
grafted
into
the
true
vine
,
that
they
might
enter
into
the
rest
of
the
Lord
their
God
.
gg
...
Now
those
priests
who
did
go
forth
among
the
people
,
did
preach
against
all
lyings
,
and
deceivings
,
and
envyings
,
and
strifes
,
and
malice
,
and
revilings
,
and
stealing
,
robbing
,
plundering
,
murdering
,
committing
adultery
,
and
-
all
manner
of
lasciviousness
;
crying
that
these
things
ought
.
not
not
so
:
to
be
;
holding
:
forth

:
whithmust
.
shortly

holding
forth

and

snd
also
:
the
:
resurrection
of

the

dead
:
Andmany
.
of
[File:283]
the
people
did
inquire
concerning
the
place
:
where
the
Son
:
of
God
should
come
;
and
,
they
were
taught
that
he
would
appear
.
unto
them
after
his
.
resurrection
;
and
this
the
people
did
hear
with
.
great
.
joy
and
gladness
.
And
now
after
the
church
having
been
:
established
throughout
all
the
land
,
having
got
the
victory
over
the
devil
,

its
purity

the
Lord
pouring

upon

_
CHAPTER
Xil
.
An
account
of
the
sons
of
Mosiah
,
who
rejected
their
rights
to
the
kingdom
,
for
the
word
of
God
,
and
went
up
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
to
preach
to
the
Lamanites
...
Their
sufferings
and
deliverance
,
according
to
the
record
of
Alma
.
Anp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
as
Alma
was
journeying
from
the
land
of
Gideon
,
southward
;
away
to
the
land
of
Manti
,
behold
,
to
his
astonishment
,
he
met
with
the
sons
of
Mosiah
,
journeying
.
towards
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
Now
these
sons
of
Mosiah
were
with
Alma
at
the
time
.
the
angel
first
appeared
unto
:
him
;.
therefore
Alma
did
rejoice
exceedingly
,
to'see
his
:
brethren
;
and
what
added
more
to
his
joy
,
they
were
still
his
brethren
in
the
Lord
;
yea
,
and
they
had
waxed
strong
in
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
;
for
they
were
men
ofa
sound
understanding
,
and
.
they
had
searehed
the
scriptures
diligently
,
that
they
might
know
.
the
word
of
God
.
But
this
is
not
all
:
they
had
given
themselves
to
much
prayer
,
and
fasting
,
therefore
they
had
.
the
spirit
of
prophecy
,
and
the
spirit
of
revelation
,
and
when
they
taught
,
they
taught
with
power
and
authority
of
God
.
And
they
had
been
teaching
the
word
.
of
God
-
for
the
space
of
fourteen
.
years
,
among
the
Lamanites
,
having
had
.
much
,
success
in
bringing
many
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
;
yea
,
by
the
power
of
their
words
,
many
were
brought
:
before
the
:
altar
of
God
;
to
call
on
his
name
,
and
confess'
their
-
sins
:
before
:
him
:
...
Now
.
these
are
the
.
circumstances
which
at
[File:284]
tended
:
them
in
their
journeyings
,
for
they
had
many
afflictions
;
they
did
suffer
much
,
both
in
body
and
in
mind
;
suchas
hunger
,
thirst
and
-
fatigue
,
and
also
much
labor
inthe
spirit
.
Now
these
were
their
journeyings
:;
Having
taken
leave
of
their
father
Mostah
,
in
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
;
having
refused
the
kingdom
which
,
their
father
was
desirous
to
confer
upon
them
;
and
also
this
was
the
minds
of
the
people
;
nevertheless
they
departed
out
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
took
their
swords
,
and
their
spears
,
and
their
bows
,
and
their
arrows
,
and
their
slings
;
and
this
they
did
that
they
might
provide
food
for
themselves
while
in
the
wilderness
:
and
thus
they
departed
into
the
wilderness
,
with
their
numbers
which
they
had
selected
,
to
go
up
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
to
preach
the
word
of
God
unto
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
journeyed
many
days
in
the
wilderness
,
and
they
fasted
much
,
that
the
Lord
would
grant
unto
them
a
portion
of
his
spirit
to
go
with
them
,
and
abide
with
them
,
that
they
might
be
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
God
,
to
bring
,
if
it
were
.
possible
,
their
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
,
to
the
know
edge
of
the
truth
;
to
the
knowledge
of
the
baseness
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
,
which
were
not
correct
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
visit
them
with
his
spirit
,
and
said
unto
them
,
be
comforted
;
and
they
were
comforted
;
And
the
Lord
said
unto
them
also
,
go
forth
among
the
Lamanites
,
thy
brethren
,
and
establish
my
word
;
yet
ye
shall
be
patient
in
lon
suffering
and
afflictions
,
that
ye
may
shew'
forth
good
examples
unto
them
in
me
,
and
Iwill
make
an
instrusoa
of
thee
in
my
hands
,
unto
the
salvation
of
many
souls
.
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
hearts
of
the
sons
of
Mosiah
;
and'
also
those
-
who
were
with
them
,
took
courage'to
go
forth
unto
the
Lamanites
,
to
declare
unto
them
the
-
word
of
God
:
mo
8
And
it
came
to
pass
when
they
-
had
arrived
in
the
borders
of
the
Jand
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
separated
themselves
,
and
departed
one
from
another
,
trust_
ing
in
the
Lord
,
that
they
should
meet
again'
at
the
close
of
their
harvest
:
for
they
supposed'
that
:
great
was
the
work
which
they
had
undertaken
.
And
assuredly
it
was
great
,
for
they
had
undertaken
to
preach
the
word
of
God
to'
wild
,
anda
hardened
,
arid
a
ferocious
people
;
a
people
who
delighted
in
murdering
the
.
[File:285]
Nephites
,
and
robbing
,
and
plundering
them
;
and
their
hearts
were
set
upon
riches
,
or
upon
gold
,
and
silver
,
and
precious
stones
;
yet
they
sought
to
obtain
these
things
by
murdering
and
plundering
,
that
they
might
not
labor
for
them
with
their
own
hands
:
thus
they
were
avery
indolent
people
,
many
of
whom
did
worship
idols
,
and
the
curse
of
God
had
fallen
upon
them
be
cause
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
;
notwithstand
ing
,
the
promises
of
the
:
Lord
were
extended
unto
them
,
on
the
conditions
of
repentance
;
therefore
this
was
the
cause
for
which
the
sons
of
Mosiah
had
undertaken
the
work
,
that
perhaps
they
might
bring
them
unto
repentance
:
that
perhaps
they
might
bring
them
.
to
know
of
the
plan
of
redemption
;
therefore
.
they
separated
themselves
one
from
another
,
and
went
forth
among
them
every
man
alone
,
according
:
to
the
word
and
power
of
God
,
which
was
given
unto
him
.
Now
Ammon
being
the'chief
among
them
,
or
rather
he
did
administer
unto
them
;
and
he
departed
from
them
,
after
having
blessed
them
according
to
their
several
stations
,
having
imparted
the
word
of
God
unto
them
,
or
administered
unto
them
before
his
departure
;
and
thus
they
took
their
several
journeys
throughout
the
land
.
And
Ammon
went
to
the
land
of
Ishmael
,
the
land
being
called
after
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
who
also
became
Lamanites
.
And
.
as
Ammon
entered
the
land
of
Ishmael
,
the
Lanianites
took
him
and
bound
him
,
as
was
their
custom
,
to
bind
all
the
Nephites
whe
fell
into
their
hands
,
and
carry
them
,
before
the
king
;
and
thus
it
was
left
to
the
pleasure
of
the
king
to
slay
them
,
or
to
retain
them
in
captivity
,
or
to
cast
them
into
prison
,
or
to
cast
them
-
out
of
his
land
;
aceordin
to
his
will
and
pleasure
;
and
thus
Ammon
was
carrie
before
the
king
who
was
over
the
land
of
Ishmael
;
and
his
name
was
Lamoni
;
and
he
was
a
desecendant
of
Ishmael
.
And
the
king
inquired
of
Ammon
if
itwere
his
desire
to
dwell'in
the
land
among
the
Lamanites
,
oramong
his
people
?
'
And
Ammon
said
unto
him
,
yea
,
I
desire
.
to
dwell
among
this
people
fora
time
;
yea
,
and
perhaps
until
the
day
I
die
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Lamoni
was
much
pleased
with
Ammon
,
and
caused
that
his
bands
should
be
loosed
;.
and
he
would
that
Ammon
should
take
one
of
his
daughters
to
wife
.
But
Ammon
said
unto
him
,
nay
,
but
Iwill
,
be
thy
servant
;
therefore
Ammon
became
aservant
to
king
Lamoni
,..
And
-
it'came
:
to
pags
that
he
-
was
-
set
,
among
other
servants
,
to
watch
the
[File:286]
flocks
of
Lamoni
,
according
to
the
custom
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
after
he
had
been
in
the
service
of
the
king
three
days
,
as
he
was
,
with
the
Lamanitish
servants
,
going
forth
with
their
flocks
,
to
the
place
of
water
,
which
was
called
the
water
of
Sebus
;
(
and
all
the
Lamanites
drive
their
flocks
hither
,
that
they
may
have
water
;)
therefore
as
Ammon
and
the
servants
of
the
king
were
driving
forth
their
flocks
to
this
place
of
water
,
behold
,
a
certain
number
of
the
Lamanites
who
had
been
with
their
flocks
to
water
,
stood
and
scattered
the
flocks
of
Ammon
,
and
the
servants
of
the
king
,
and
they
scattered
them
insomuch
that
they
fled
many
ways
.
Now
the
servants
of
the
king
began
to
murmur
,
saying
,
now
the
king
will
slay
.
us
,
as
he
has
our
brethren
,
because
their
flocks
were
scattered
by
the
wickednesss
ofthese
men
.
And
they
began
to
weep
exceedingly
,
saying
,
behold
our
flocks
are
scattered
already
.
Now
they
wept
because
of
the
fear
of
being
slain
.
Now
when
Ammon
saw
this
,
his
heart
was
swollen
within
him
,
with
joy
;
for
,
said
he
,
I
will
shew
forth
my
power
unto
these
my
fellow
servants
,
or
the
power
which
is
in
me
,
in
restoring
these
flocks
unto
the
king
,
that
I
may
win
the
hearts
of
these
my
fellow
servants
,
that
i
may
lead
them
to
believe
in
my
words
.
Now
these
were
the
thoughts
of
Ammon
,
when
he
saw
the
afflictions
of
those
whom
he
termed
to
be
bis
brethren
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
flattered
them
by
his
words
.
saying
,
my
brethren
,
be
of
good
cheer
and
let
us
go
in
search
of
the
flocks
,
and
we
will
gather
them
together
,
and
bring
them
back
unto
the
place
of
water
;
and
.
thus
we
will
reserve
the
flocks
unto
the
king
,
and
he
will
not
slay
us
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
in
search
of
the
flocks
,
and
they
did
follow
Ammon
,
and
they
rushed
forth
with
much
swiftness
,
and
did
head
the
flocks
of
the
king
,
and
did
gather
them
together
again
,
to
the
place
of
water
.
And
those
men
again
stood
to
scatter
their
flocks
;
but
Ammon
said
unto
his
brethren
,
encircle
the
flocks
round
about
that
they
flee
not
;
and
I
go
and
contend
with
these
men
who
do
scatter
our
flocks
...
Therefore
they
did
as
Ammon
commanded
them
,
and
he
went
forth
and
stood
to
contend
with
those
who
stood
by
the
waters
of
Sebus
;
and
they
were
in
number
not
a
few
;
therefore
they
did
not
fear
Ammon
,
for
they
supposed
that
one
of
their
men
could
slay
him
,
aecording
to
their
pleasure
,
for
they
knew
[File:287]
not'that
the
Lord
had
promised
Mosiah
that
he
would
.
deliver
-
his
sons
.
out
of
their
hands
;
neither
did
they
know
-
any
thing
concerning
the
Lord
;
therefore
they
delighted
in
the
destruction
of
their
bretbren
;
and
for
this
cause
they
stood
to
scatter
the
flocks
of
the
king
.
But
Ammon
stood
forth
and
began
to'cast
stones
at
them
with
his
sling
;
yea
,
with
mighty
power
he
did
sling
stones
amongst
them
;
and
thus
he
slew
a
certain
number
of
them
,
insomuch
that
they
began
to
be
astonished
at
his
power
;
nevertheless
they
were
angry
:
because
of
the
slain
of
their
brethren
,
and
they
were
determined
that
he
should
fall
;
therefore
,
seeing
that
they
could
not
hit
him
with
their
stones
,
they
cameo
forth
with
clubs
to
slay
him
.
But
behold
,
every
man
that
lifted
his
:
club
to
smite
Ammon
,
he
smote
off
their
arms
with
his
sword
;
for
he
did
withstand
their
blows
by
smiting
their
arms
with
the
edge
of
his
sword
,
insomuch
that
they
began
to
.
be
astonished
,
and
began
to
flee
before
him
;
yea
,
and
they
were
not
few
in
number
;
and
he
caused
them
to
flee
-
by
the
strength
of
his
arm
.
Now
six
of
them
had
fallen
by
the
sling
,
but
he
slew
none
save'
it
were
their
leader
,
with
his
sword
;
and
he
smote
off
as
many
of
their
arms
as
were
lifted
against
him
,
and
they
were
nota
few
.
And
when
he
had
driven
them
afar
off
,
he
returned
,
and
they
watered
their
flocks
and
returned
them
to
the
pasture
of
the
king
,
and
then
went
in
unto
the
king
,
bearing
the
arms
which
had
been
smote
off
by
the
sword
of
Ammon
,
of
those
who
sought
to
slay
him
;
and
they
were
carried
in
unto
the
king
,
for
a
testimony
of
the
things
which
they
had
done
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Lamoni
caused
that
his
servants
should
stand
forth
and
testify
to
all
the
things
which
they
had
seen
concerning
the
matter
.
And
when
they
had
all
testified
to
the
things
which
they
had
seen
,
and
he
had
learned
of
the
faithfulness
of
Ammon
in
preserving
his
flocks
,
and
also
of
his
great
power
in
contending
against
those
who
sought
to
slay
him
,
he
was
astonished
exceedingly
,
and
said
,
sure&
this
is
more
than
a
man
.
'
Behold
,
is
not
this
the
reat
Spirit
who
doth
send
such
great
punishments
upon
this
people
,
because
of
theirmurders
?
And
they
answered
the
king
,
and
said
,
whether
he
be
the
Great
Spirit
or
aman
,
we
know
not
;
but
this
much
we
do
know
,
that
he
cannot
be
slain
by
the
enemies
of
the
king
;
neither
can
they
scatter
the
king's
flocks
when
[File:288]
he
is
with
us
,
because
of
his
expertness
and
great
strength
;
therefore
,
we
know
that
he
is
a
friend
to
the
king
.
And
now
,
O
king
,
we
donot
believe
that
a
man
has
such
graat
power
,
for
we
know
that
he
cannot
be
slain
.
And
now
when
the
king
heard
these
words
,
he
said
unto
them
,
now
J
know
that
it
is
the
Great
Spirit
;
and
he
has
come
down
at
this
time
to
preserve
your
lives
,
that
[
might
not
slay
you
.
as
I
-
did
your
brethren
.
Now
this
is
the
Great
Spirit
of
whom
our
fathers
have
spoken
.
Now
this
was
Lhe
tradition
of
Lamoni
,
which
he
had
received
fram
-
his
father
,
that
there
was
a
Great
Spirit
.
Notwithstanding
they
believed
in
a
Great
Spirit
,
they
supposed
that
whatsoever
they
did
,
was
right
;
nevertheless
,
Lamoni
began
to
fear
exceedingly
,
with
fear
lest
he
had
done
wrong
in
slaying
his
servants
:
for
he
had
slain
many
of
them
,
because
their
brethren
had
scattered
their
flocks
.
at
the
place
of
water
;
and
thus
because
they
had
had
their
flocks
seattered
,
they
were
slain
.
Now
it
.
was
-
the
practice
of
the
Lamanites
,
to
stand
by
the
waters
of
Sebus
,
to
seatter
the
flocks
of
the
people
,
that
thereby
they
might
drive
away
many
that
were
scattered
,
unto
their
own
land
,
it
being
a
practice
of
plunder
among
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Lamoni
inquired
of
his
servants
,
saying
where
is
this
man
that
has
such
great
power
?
And
they
said
unto
him
,
behold
,
he
is
feeding
thy
horses
.
Now
the
king
had
commanded
his
servants
previous
to
the
time
of
the
watering
of
their
flocks
,
that
they
should
prepare
his
horses
and
chariots
,
and
conduct
him
forth
to
the
lantidsof
Nephi
:
for
there
had
been
a
great
feast
appointed
at
the
land
of
Nephi
,
by
the
father
of
Lainoni
,
who
was
king
over
all
the
land
.
Now
when
king
Lamoni
heard
that
.
Ammion
was
preparing
his
horses
and
-
his
chariots
,
he
was
more
astonished
,
because
of
the
faithfulness
of
Ammon
,
saying
,
surely
,
there
has
not
-
been
any
servant
among
all
my
servants
,
that
has
been
so
faithful
as
this
man
;
for
even
he
doth
:
remember
all
.
my
commandments
to
execute
them
.
Now
i
surely
know
that
this
is
the
Great
Spirit
;
and
Â£
would
desire
him
that
he
eome
in
-
unto
me
,
but]
durst
not
,
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Ammon
had
made
ready
the
horses
and
the
chariots
for
the
king
and
his
servants
;
he
went
.
in
unto
the
king
,
and
he
saw
that
the
countenance
of
the
king
was
changed
;,
therefore
he
Was
about
to
returnout
-
of
his
presence
;
and
one
of
the
king's
servants
said
unto
him
,
Rabbanah
,
which
is
,
[File:289]
being
interpreted
,
powerful
or
great
kir'y
,
considering
their
kings
to
be
powerful
;
and
thus
e
said
unto
him
,
Rabbanah
,
the
king
desireth
thee
ito
:
stay
;
therefore
Ammon
turned
himself
unto
the
.
king
,
and
said
unto
hime
what
wilt
thou
that
I
should
do
fer
thee
,
O
king
?
And
the
king
answered
.
him
not
for
the
space
of
.
an
hour
,
according
to
their
time
,
for
he
knew
not
,
what
he
should
say
unto
him
.
Andit'
came
-
to
pass
that
Ammon
said
unto
him
again
,
what
desirest
thou
of
me
?
But
the
king
answered
him
not
.
And
it
came
to
-
pass
that
Amnion
,
being
filled
with
the
spirit
of
God
,
therefore
-
he
perceived
.
the
thoughts
of
the
ing
.
And
he
said
unto
him
,
is
it
because
thoa
hast
heard
that
I
defended
thy
servants
and
thy
flocks
,
aad
slew
seven
of
their
brethren
with
.
the
alice
,
and
with
the
sword
,:
and
smote
off
the
arms
.
of
others
,
in
order
to
defend
thy
flocks
and
thy
servants
;
behold
,
ie
it
this
that
causeth
thy
marvelings
?
t
.
I
say
unto
you
,
what
is
it
,
that
thy
marvelings
are
so
great
?
Beheld
,
Lama
man
,
and
am
thy
servant
;
therefore
,
whatsoever
thou
desirest
which
is
right
,
that
will
Ido
.
Now
when
the
king
had
heard
these
:
words
,
he
marveled
again
,
for
he
beheld
that
Ammon
.
could
discern
his
thoughts
;
but
notwithstanding
this
,
king
Lamoni
did
open
his
mouth
:
and
said
unto
.
him
,
who
art
thou
?
Art
thou
that
Great
Spirit
,
who
knows
all
things
?
Ammon
answered
and
said
unto
him
,
I
am
not
.
And
the
king
said
,
how
knowest
thou
the
thoughts
of
my
heart
?
Thou
mayest
speak
boldly
,
and
tell
me
concerning
these
things
;
and
also
tell
me
by
what
power
ye
slew
and
smote
off
the
arms
of
my
.
brethren
,
that
seattered
my
flocks
.
And
now
.
if
thou
wilt
tell
me
concerning
these
things
,
whatsoever
:
thou
desirest
;
I
will
give
unto
.
thee
;.
and
if
it
were
needed
,
I
would
guard
thee
with
:
my
armies
;
but
,
I
know
that
thou
art
more
powerful
than
all
they
:
nevertheless
,
whatsoever
thou
desirest
.
of
me
,
I
.
will
grant
it
unto
thee
.
Now
Ammon
being
.
wise
,
yet
harmless
,
he
said
unto
Lamoni
,
wilt
thou
hearken
unto
my
words
,
if
I
tell
thee
by
what
power
I
do
-
these
things
?
and
this
is
the
thing
that
I
-
desire
of
thee
...
And
the
king
answered
him
,
and
-
said
;
yea
,
I
will
believe
all
.
thy
words
;
and
thus
he
.
was
caught
with
.
guilee
oAnd
Ammon'
began
to
speak
.
unto
him
with
boldness
;
and
said
unto
him
,
believest
-
thou
,
that
.
there
..
is
:
a
God
?-
And
he
answered
,
and
.
saidvunto
-
him
,

not
.
snow
what
that
.
meaneth
.
And
.
then
:
Ammon
:
aid
,
believest
,
thou
that
there
is
-
a
[File:290]
Great
Spirit
?
And
he
said
,
yea
,
;
And
.
Ammon
said
,
this
is
God
.
And
.
Ammon
said
unto
:
him
again
;
believest
thou
that
this
Great
Spirit
,
whois
God
,
created
all
things
,
-
which
are
in
heaven
and
in
the
earth
?
And
he
said
,
yea
,
[believe
that
he
created
all
things
which
arein
the
earth
;
but
I
donot
know
,
the
heavens
.
And
Ammon
said
unto
him
,
the
heayens
is
.
a
place
where
God
dwells
,
and
all
his
holy
angels
.
And
king
Lamom
said
,
is
it
above
the
earth
?)
And
Ammon
said
,
yea
,
and
he
looketh
down
upon
all
the
.
children
of
men
;
and
he
knows
all
the
thoughts
and
intents
of
the
heart
:
for
by
his
hand
were
they
all
created
,
from
the
beginning
.
And
king
Lamoni
said
,
I
believe
all
these
things
which
thou
hast
spoken
.
Art
thou
sent
from
God
?
Ammon
said
unto
him
,
J
ama
man
;
and
man
in
the
beginning
,
was
created
after
the
image
of
God
,
and
I
am
called
by
his
Holy
Spirit
to
teach
these
things
unto
this
people
,
that
they
may
be
brought
to
a
knowledge
of
that
which
is
just
and
troe
;
and
a
portion
of
that
Spirit
dwelleth
in
me
,
which
giveth
me
knowledge
,
and
also
power
,
according
to
my
faith
and
desires
which
are
in
God
.
Now
when
Ammon
had
said
these
words
,
he
began
to
the
creation
of
the
world
,
and
also
the
creation
of
Adam
,
and
told
him
all
the
things
concerning
the
fall
of
man
,
and
rehearsed
and
laid
before
him
the
records
and
the
holy
scriptures
of
the
people
,
which
had
been
spoken
by
the
prophets
,
even
down
to
the
time
that
their
father
Lehi
left
Jerasalem
;
and
he
also
rehearsed
unto
them
(
for
it
was
unto
the
king
and
to
his
servants
,)
all
the
journeyings
of
their
fathers
in
the
wilderness
,
and
all
their
sufferings
with
hunger
and
thirst
,
and
their
travel
,
&c
.:
and
he
also
rehearsed
unto
them
concerning
the
rebellions
of
Laman
and
Lemuel
,
and
the
sons
of
Ishmael
,
yea
,
al
!
their
iebellions
did
he
relate
unto
-
them
;
and
he
expounded
unto
them
all
the
records
and
scriptures
,
from
the
time
that
Lehi
left
Jerusalem
,
down
to
the
present
time
;
but
this
is
not
all
;
for
he
expounded
unto
them
the
plan
of
redemption
,
which
was
prenared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
;
and
he
also
made
known
unto
them
concerning
the
coming
of
Christ
;
and
all
the
works
of
the
Lord
did
he
make
known
unto
them
.
And
it
came
-
to
pass
that
after
he
had
said
all
these
things
,
and
expounded
them
to
the
king
,
that
the
king
believed
all
-
his
words
.
And
he
began'to
ery
unto
the
Lord
,
saying
:
O
Lord
,
have
merey
;
according
to
thy
abundant
mercy
which
thou
hast
had
upon
the
people
[File:291]
of
Nephi
,
have
upon
me
and
my
people
.
And
now
when
he'
had
said
this
,
he
fell
unto'the
earth
,
as
if
he
were
dead
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
his
servants
took
him
and
carried
him
in
unto
his
wife
,
and
laid
him
upon
a
bed
;
and
he
lay
as
if
he
were
dead
,
for
the
space
of
two
days
and
two'nights
;
and
his
wife
,
and
his
sons
,
and
his
daughters
mourned
over
him
,
after
is
manner
of
the
Lamanites
,
greatly
lamenting
his
oss
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
two
days
and
two
nights
,
they
were
about
to
take
his
body
and
lay
it
in
asepulchre
which
they
had
made
for
the
purpose
of
burying
their
dead
.
Now
the
queen
having
heard
of
the
fame
of
Ammon
,
therefore
she
sent
and
desired
that
he
should
comein
untoher
.
And
it
came
to
pass
thatAmmon
did
-
as
he
was
commanded
,
and'
went
in
unto
the
queen
,
and
desired
to
know
what
she
would
that
he'
should
do
.
And
she
said
unto
him
,
the
servants
of
my
husband
have
made
it
known
unto
me
,
that
thou
art
a
prophet
of
a
holy
God
,
and
that
thou
hast
power
to
do
many
mighty
works
in
his
name
;
therefore
,
if
this
is
the
case
,
-
I
would
that
ye
should
go
in
and
see
my
husband
,
for
he
has
been
laid
upon
his
bed
for
the
space
of
two
days
and
two
nights
;
and
some
say
that
heis
not
dead
,
but
others
say
that
he
is
dead
,
and
that
he
stinketh
,
and
that
he
ought
to
be
placed
in
the
sepulchre
;
but
as
for
myself
,
to
.
me
he
doth
not'stink
.
Now
this
was
what
Ammon
desired
,
for
he
knew
that
king
Lamoni
was
under
the
power
of
God
;
he
knew
that
the
dark
veil
of
unbelief
being
cast
away
from
his
mind
,
and
the
light
which
did
light
v
his
mind
,
which
was
the
light
of
the
glory
of
God
,
which
was
a
marvelous
light
of
his
goodness
;
yea
,
this
light
had
infused
such
joy
into
his
soul
,
the
cloud
of
:
darkness
having
been
dispelled
,
and
that
the
light
of
everlasting
light
was
lit
up
in
his
soul
;
yea
,
he
knew
that
this
had
overcome
his
natural
frame
,
and
he
was
carried'
away
in
God
;
therefore
,
what
the
queen
desired
:
of
him
,.
was
his
only
desire
.
Therefore
he
went
in
to
see
the
king
,
according
as
the
queen
had
desived
him
;
and
he
saw
the
king
,
and
he
knew
that
hewas
not
dead
.
And
he
said
unto
the
queen
,
he
is
not
dead
,
but
he
sleepeth
in
God
,
and
on
the
morrow
he
shall
rige
-
again
;
therefore
bury
him
not
.
And
Am

mon
said
unto
her
,
believest
thou
this
?
And
she'
said
unto
him
,
J
have
had
no
witness
,
save
thy
word
,
and
the
word
of
our
servants
;
nevertheless
,
TI
believe
that
[File:292]
it
shall
be
according
as
thou
hast
said
.
And
Ammon
said
unto
her
,
blessed
art
thou
,
because
of
thy
exceeding
faith
;
I
say
unto
thee
,
woman
,
there
has
not
been
such
great
faith
among
all
the
people
of
the
Nephites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
she
watched
over
the
bed
of
her
husband
,.
from
that
time
,
even
until
that
time
on
the
morrow
which
Ammon
had
appointed
that
he
should
rise
...
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
arose
,
according
to
the
words
of
Ammon
;
and
as
he
arose
,
he
streteted
.
forth
his
hand
unto
the
woman
,
and
said
,
blessed
be
the
name
-
of
God
,
and
blessed
art
thou
;
for
as
sure
as
thou
livest
,
behold
,
I
have
seen
my
Redeemer
;
and
he
shall
come
forth
,
and
be
born
of
a
woman
,
and
he
shall
redeem
all
.
mankind
who
believe
on
his
name
.
Now
when
he
had
said
these
words
,
his
heart
was
swollen
within
:
him
,
and
he
sunk
again
with
joy
:
and
the
queen
also
sunk
down
,
being
overpowered
by
the
spirit
...
Now
Ammon
seeing
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
-
poured
-
out
-
according
to
his
prayers
upon
the
Lamanites
,
hisbrethren
;
who
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
mourning
among
-
the
Nephites
,
or
among
all
the
people
of
God
,
because
of
.
their
iniquities
and
their
traditions
,
he
fell
upon
his
knees
,
and
began
to
pour
out
his
soul
in
prayer
and
thanksgiving
to
God
,
for
what
heshad
done
for
his
brethren
:
and
he
was
also
overpowered
with
joy
;
and
thus
they
all
three
had
sunk
to
the
earth
.
Now
when
the
servants
of
the
king
had
seen
that
they
had
fallen
,
they
also
began
to'cry
unto
God
,
for
the
fear
of
the
Lord
had
come
upon
them
also
,
for
it
-
was
they
who
had
stood
before
the
king
,
and
testified
unto
him
concerning
,
the
great
power
of
Ammon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
call
.
on
:
the
name
of
the
Lord
,
in
their
might
,
even
until
they
had
all
fallen
to
the
earth
,
save
it
were
one
of
the
Lamanitish
women
,
whose
:
name
was
Abish
,
she
having
been
converted
unto
the
Lord
for
many
years
,
on
account
of
a
remarkable
vision
of
her
father
;
thus
having
been
converted
.
to
the
Lord
,
never
had
made
it
.
known
;
therefore
when
she
saw
that
all
the
servants
of
Lamoni
had
fallen
tothe
earth
,
and
also
her
mistress
,
the
queen
,
and
the
king
,
and
Ammon
lay
prostrate
upon
the
earth
,
she
knew
that
it
was
the
power
of
God
;
and
supposing
that
this
opportunity
,
by
making
known
unto
the
people
what
had
happened
among
them
,
that
by
beholding
thisscene
,
it
would
cause
them
to
believe
in'
the
power
.
of
God
;
thereforeshe
-
ran
forth
:
from
[File:293]
house
to
house
,
making
it
.
known
unto'
the
people
;
and
they
began
to
assemble
themselves
together
unto
the
house
of
the
king
.
And
there
came
a
multitude
,
and
to
their
astonishment
,
they
beheld
the
king
,
and
the
queen
,
and
their
servants
,
prostrate
upon
the
earth
,
and
they
all
lay
there
as
though
they
were
dead
;
and
they
also
saw
Aminon
,
and
behold
,
he
.
was
a
Nephite
.
And
now
the
people
began
to
murmur
among
themselves
;
some
saying
,
that
it
was
a
great
evil
that
had
come
upon
them
,
or
upon
the
king
and
his
house
,
because
he
had
suffered
that
the
Nephite
-
should
.
remain
in
the
land
.
But
:
others
rebuked
them
,
saying
,
the
king
hath
brought
this
evil
upon
his
house
,
beeause
he
slew
his
servants
who
had
had
their
flocks
scattered
at
the
waters
of
Sebus
;
and
they
were
also
rebuked
by
those'
men
who
had
stood
at
the
waters
of
Sebus
,
and
scattered
the
flocks
which
belonged
to
the
king
,
for
they
were
angry
with
Ammon
because
of
the
number
which
he
had
slain
of
their
brethren
at
the
waters
of
Sebus
,
while
defending
the
flocks
of
the
king
.
Now
one
of
them
,
whose
brother
had
been
slain
with
the
sword
of
Ammon
,
being
exeeeding
angry
with
Ammon
,
drew
his
sword
and
went
forth
that
.
he
might
let
it
fall
upon
Ammon
,
to
slay
him
;
and
as
he
lifted
the
sword
to
smite
him
,
behold
,
he
fell
dead
.
Now
weâ
see
that
Ammon
could
not
be
slain
,
for
the
Lord
:
had
said
unto
Mosiah
,
his
father
,
I
will
spare
him
,
and
it
shall
be
unto
him
according
to
thy
faith
;
therefore
Mosiah
trusted
him
unto
the
Lord
.
And
it
cam
?
to
pass
that
when
the
multitude
beheld
that
the
man
had
fallen
dead
,
who
lifted
the
sword
to
slay
Ammon
,
fear
came
upon
them
all
,
and
they
durst
not
put
forth
their
bands
to
touch
him
,
or
any
of
those
who
had
fallen
;
and
they
began
to
marvel
again
among
themselves
what
could
be
the
cause
of
this
great
power
,
or
what
all
these
things
could
mean
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
among
them
,
who
said
that
Ammon
was
the
Great
Spirit
,
and
others
said
he
was
sent
by
the
Great
Spirit
;
but
others
rebuked
them
all
,
saying
,
that
he
was
a
monster
,
who
had
been
sent
from
the
Nephites
to
torment
us
;
and
there
were
some
who
said
that
Ammon
was
sent
b
the
Great
Spirit
to
afflict
them
,
because
of
their
iniquities
;
and
that
it
-
was
the
Great
:
Spirit
that
had
alWays
attended
the
Nephites
;
who
had
:
ever
delivered
.
them
out
of
their
hands
;
and
they
said
that
it
was
this
Great
Spirit
who
had
destroyed
so
many
of
theirbreth
[File:294]
ren
,
the
Lamanites
;
and
thus
the
contention
began
to
be
exceeding
sharp
among
them
.
And
while
.
they
were
thus
contending
,
the
woman
servant
who
had
caused
the
multitude
to
be
gathered
together
,
came
;
and
when
she
saw
the
contention
which
was
among
the
multitude
,
she
was
exceeding
sorrowful
,
even
unto
tears
.
And
it
came
.
to
pass
that
she
went
and
took
the
queen
by
the
hand
,
that
perhaps
she
might
raise
her
from
the
ground
;
and
as
soon
as
she
touched
her
hand
,
she
arose
and
stood
upon
her
feet
,.
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
,
saying
,
O
blesseed
Jesus
,
who
has
saved
me
from
an
awful
hell
!
O
blessed
God
,
have
mercy
on
this
people
.
And
when
she
had
said
this
,
she
clasped
her
hands
being
filled
with
joy
speaking
many
words
which
were
not
understood
;
and
when
she
-
had
done
this
,
she
took
the
king
,
Lamoni
,
by
the
hand
,
and
behold
he
arose
and
stood
upon
his
feet
;
and
he
imme
.
diately
,
seeing
the
contention
among
his
people
,
went
forth
and
:
began
to
rebuke
them
,
and
to
teach
them
the
words
which
he
had
heard
from
the
mouth
of
Ammon
;
and
as
many
as
heard
his
words
,
believed
,
and
were
conyerted
unto
the
Lord
.
But
there
were
many
among
.
them
who
would
not
hear
his
words
;
therefore
they
went
their
way
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Ammon
arose
;
he
also
.
administered
unto
them
,
and
also
did
all
the
servants
of
Lamoni
;
and
they
did
all
declare
unto
the
people
the
self
-
same
thing
:
that
their
hearts
had
been
changed
;
that
they
had
no
more
desire
to
do
eyil
.
And
behold
,
many
did
declare
unto
the
people
that
they
had
seen
angels
,
and
had
conversed
with
them
;
and
thus
they
had
told
them
things
of
God
,
and
of
his
righteousness
.
And_it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
that
did
believe
in
their
words
;
and
as
many
as
did
believe
,
were
baptized
;
and
they
oecame
a
righteous
people
,
and
they
did
establish
a
church
among
them
:
and
thus
the
work
of
the
Lord
did
commence
among
the
Lamanites
;
thus
the
Lord
did
begin
to
pour
out
his
spirit
upon
them
;
and
we
see
that
his
arm
isextended
to
all
people
who
will
repent
and
believe
on
his
name
.
.
it
And
it
came
to
pags
that
when
they
lad
.
established
a
.
ehurch
in
that
land
,
that
king
LLamoni
desired
.
that
Ammon
:
should
go
with
him
tothe
land
of
Nephi
,
thathe
might
show
Aa
ante
his
father
...
And
the
voice
of
:
the
Lord
..
came
-
to
Ammon
,-
gaying
,..
thon
:-

not
.
go
:
[File:295]
up
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,:
for
behold
,
the
king
will
seek
thy
life
;
but
thou
shalt
go
to
the
land
of
Middoni
;
for
behold
,
thy
brother
Aaron
,
and
also
Muloki
and
Ammah
are
in
prison
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Ammon
had
heard
this
,
he
said
unto
Lamoni
,
behold
,
my
brother
and
brethren
are
in
prison
at
Middoni
,
and
I
go
that
I
may
deliver
them
.
Now
Lamoni
said
unto
Ammon
,
[
know
,
in
the
strength
of
the
Lord
,
thou
canst
do
all
things
.
But
behold
,
I
will
go
with
thee
to
the
land
of
Middoni
;
for
the
king
of
the
land
of
Middoni
,
whose
name
is
Antiomno
,
is
a
friend
unto
me
;
therefore
J
go
to
the
land
of
Middoni
,
that
I
may
flatter
the
king
of
the
land
;
and
he
will
cast
thy
brethren
out
of
prison
.
Now
Lamoni
said
unto
him
,
whe
told
thee
that
my
brethren
were
in
prison
?)
And
Ammon
said
unto
him
,
no
one
hath
told
me
,
save
it
be
God
:
and
he
said
unto
me
,
go
and
deliver
thy
brethren
,
for
they
are
in
prison
in
the
land
of
Middoni
.
Now
when
Lamoni
had
heard
this
,
he
caused
that
his
servants
should
make
ready
his
horses
,
and
his
chariots
.
And
he
said
unto
Ammon
come
,
I
will
go
with
thee
down
to
the
land
of
Middoni
,
and
there
[
will
plead
with
the
king
,
that
he
will
cast
thy
brethren
out
of
prison
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
Ammon
and
Lamoni
were
journeying
thither
,
that
they
met
the
father
of
Lamoni
,
who
was
king
overall
the
land
.
And
behold
,
the
father
of
Lamonisaid
unto
him
,
why
did
yeziot
come
to
the
feast
,
on
that
great
day
when
I
made
a
feast
unto
my
sons
,
and
unto
my
people
?
And
he
also
said
,
whither
art
thou
going
with
this
Nephite
,
who
is
one
of
the
children
of
a
liar
?
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Lamoni
rehearst
unto
him
whither
he
was
going
,
for
he
feared
to
offend
him
.
And
he
also
told
him
all
the
cause
of
his
tarrying
in
his
own
kingdom
,
that
he
did
not
go
unto
his
father
,
to
the
feast
which
he
had
-
prepared
.
And
now
when
Lamoni
had
rehearsed
unto
bim
all
these
things
,
behold
to
his
astonishment
,
his
father
was
angry
with
him
,
and
said
Lamoni
,
thou
art
going
to
deliver
these
Nephites
,
who
.
are
sons
of
a
liar
.
Behold
,
he
robbed
our
fathers
;
and'now
his
children
are
also
come
amongst
us
,
that
they
may
,
by
their
cunning
and
their
lyings
,
deceive
us
,
that
they
again
may
rob'us
of
our
property
.
Now
the
father
of
Lamoni
commanded
him
that
he
should
slay
Ammon
,
with
the
:
sword
.
Andhe
alsocommarided
him
that
:
he
should
:
not'go
to
the'land
of
Middoni
,
but
that
he
should
te
&
[File:296]
turn
with
hm
,
to
the
land
-
of
-
Ishmael
.
But
,
Lamoni
said
unto'him
,
I
will
not
slay
Ammon
,
neither
-
will
I
return
to
the
land
of
Ishmael
,
but
I]
goto
the
land
of
Middoni
,
that
J
may
release
the
brethren
of
Ammon
,
for
I
know
that
they
are
just
men
,
and
holy
prophets
of
the
true
God
.
Now
when
his
father
had
heard
these
words
,
he
was
angry
with
him
,
and
he
drew
his
sword
that
he
might
smite
him
to
the
earth
.
But
Ammon
stood
forth
and
said
unto
him
,
behold
,
thou
shalt
not
slay
thy
son
;
nevertheless
,
it
were
better
that
he
should
fall
than
.
thee
:
for
behold
,
he
has
repented
of
his
sins
;
but
if
thou
shouldst
fall
at
this
:
time
,
in
thine
anger
,
thy
suul
could
not
be
saved
.
And
again
,
it
is
expedient
that
thou
shouldst
forbear
;
for
if
.
thou
shouldst
slay
thy
son
,
(
he
being
an
innocent
man
,)
his
blood
would
cry
from
the
ground
,
to
the
Lord
his
Gad
,
for
vengeance
to
come
.
upon
thee
;
and
.
perhaps
thou
wouldst
lose
t
:
y
soul
.
Now
when
Ammon
had
said
these
words
unto
him
,
he
answered
him
,
saying
,
I
know
that
iff
should
slay
my
son
,
that
I
should
shed
.
1nnocent
blood
;
for
it
is
thou
that
hast
sought
to
destroy
him
:
and
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
to
sl
.
y
Ammon
.
But
Ammon
withstood
his
blows
,
and
also
smote
his
arm
that
he
could
not
use
it
.
Now
wien
the
king
saw
that
Ammon
could
slay
him
,
he
began
to
plead
with
Ammon
,
that
he
would
spare
his
life
.
But
Ammon
raised
his
sword
,
and
said
unto
him
,
behold
,
I
will
-
smite
thee
,
except
thou
wilt
grant
unto
me
that
my
brethren
may
be
cast
out
of
prison
.
Now
the
king
,
fearing
he
should
lose
his
life
,
said
,
if
thou
wilt
spare
me
,
will
grant
unto
thee
whatsoever
thou
wilt
ask
,
even
to
half
of
the
kingdom
.
Now
when
Ammon
saw
that
be
had
wrought
upon
the
old
king
according
to
his
desire
,
he
said
unto
him
,
if
thou
wilt
grant
that
my
brethren
may
be
cast
out
of
prison
,
and
also
that
Lamoni
may
retain
his
kingdom
,
and
that
ye
be
not
displeased
with
him
,
but
grant
that
he
may
do
according
to
his
own
desires
,
in
whatsoever
thing
he
thinketh
,
then
will]
spare
thee
;
otherwise
Iwill
smite
thee
to
the
earth
,
Now
when
Ammon
had
said
these
words
,
the
king
began
to
rejoice
because
of
his
life
.
And
when
he
saw
-
that
Ammon
had
no
desire
to
destroy
him
,
and
when
he
also
saw
.
the
great
love
he
had
for
his
son
Lamoni
,,
he
was
astonished
exeecedingly
,
and
gaid
;
'
because
this
is
all
that
thou
hast
desired
,
that
-
I
-
would
release
thy
:
brethren
,
and
suffer
that
my
son
Lamoni
should
retain
his
kingdom
,
behold
,
[File:297]
I
-
will
-
grant
unto
you
that
my
son
may
retain
his
kingdom
from
this
.
time
and
forever
;
and
{will
govern
him
no
more
.
And]
will
also
.
grant
unto
thee
that
thy
brethren
may
be
cast
out
of
prison
,
and
thou
and
thy
brethren
may
come
unto
me
,
in
my
kingdom
;
for
-
T
shall
greatly
desire
to
see
thee
:
for
the
king
was
greatly
astonished
at
the
words
:
which
he
had
spoken
,
and
also
at
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
his
son
Lamoni
:
therefore
he
was
desirous
to
learn
them
.
And
.
it
-.
came
to
pass
that
Ammon
and
Lamoni
proceeded
on
their
journey
towards
the
land
of
Middoni
.
And
Lamoni
found
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
king
of
the
land
;
therefore
the
brethren
-
of
Ammon
were
brought
forth
out
of
prison
.
And
when
Ammon
did
Meet
them
,
he
was
exceeding
sorrowful
,
for
behold
,
they
were
naked
,
and
their
skins
were
worn
.
exceedingly
,
because
of
being
bound
with
strong
cords
.
And
they
also
had
suffered
hunger
,
thirst
,
and
-
all
kind
of
afflictions
;
nevertheless
they
were
patient
in
all
.
their
,
sufferings
..
And
as
it
happened
,
it
was
their
lot
to
:
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
more
hardened
and
a
-
more
stiffnecked
people
;
therefore
they
would
not
hearken
unto
their
words
,
and
they
had
cast
them
out
,
and
had
smitten
them
,
and
had
driven
them
from
house
.
to
house
,
and
from
place
to
place
,
even
until
they
bad
arriven
to
the
land
of
Middoni
;
and
there
they
were
taken
and
cast
into
prison
,
and
.
bound
with
strong
cords
,
and
kept
,
in
prison
for
many
days
;
and
were
delivered
by
Lamoni
and
Ammon
.

CHAPTER
XIII
.
An
account
of
the
preaching
of
Aaron
and
Muloki
,
and
their
brethren
,
to
the
Lamanites
.
Now
when
Ammon
and
his
brethren
separated
themselvesin
the
borders
of
the
land
of
the
Lamanites
,
behold
,
Aaron
took
his
journey
towards
the
land
which
was
called
by
the
Lamanites
,
Jerusalem
;
calling
it
af
:
ter
the
lund
of
their
fathers'
nativity
:
andit
was
away
joining
the
borders
of
Mormon
.
~Now
the
Lamanites
;
and
the
Amulekites
,
and
the
peuple
of
Amulonj
had
built
-
agreat
-
city
,;
which
was'called
Jerusalem
.
â
Now
[File:298]
the
Lamanites
,
of
themselves
,
were
sufficiently
hardened
,
but
the
Amalekites
,
and
the
Amulonites
,
were
still
harder
;
therefore
they
did
cause
the
Lamanites
that
they
should
harden
their
hearts
,
that
they
should
wax
strong
in
wickedness
,
and
their
abominations
.
And
it
-
came
to
pass
that
Aaron
came
to
the
city
of
Jerusalem
,
and
firstly
began
to
preach
to
the
Amalekites
.
And
he
began
to
preach
to
them
in
their
synagogues
,
for
they
had
built
synagogues
,
after
the
order
of
the
Nehors
;
for
many
of
the
Amalekites
and
the
Amulonites
were
after
the
order
of
the
Nehors
.
Therefore
,
as
Aaron
entered
into
one
of
their
synagogues
to
preach
unto
the
people
,
and
as
he
was
speaking
unto
them
,
behold
there
arose
an
Amalekite
,
and
began
to
contend
with
him
,
saying
,
what
is
that
thou
hast
testified
?
Hast
thou
seen
an
angel
?
Why
do
not
angels
appear
unto
us
?
Behold
,
are
not
this
people
as
good
as
thy
people
?
Thou
also
sayest
,
except
we
repent
,
we
shall
perish
.
How
knowest
thou
the
thought
and
intent
of
our
heart
?)
How
knowest
thou
that
we
have
cause
to
repent
?
How
knowest
thou
that
we
are
not
a
righteous'people
?
Behold
,
we
have
built
sanctuaries
,
and
we
do
assemble
ourselves
together
to
worship
God
.
Wedo
believe
that
God
will
save
all
men
.
Now
Aaron
said
unto
him
,
believest
thou
that
the
Son
of
God
shall
come
to
redeem
mankind
from
their
sins
?)
And
the
man
said
unto
him
,
we
do
not
believe
that
thou
knowest
any
such
thing
.
We
do
not
believe
in
thes2
foolish
traditions
,
We
do
not
.
believe
that
thou
knowest
of
things
to
come
,
neither
do
we
believe
that
thy
fathers
,
and
also
that
our
fathers
did
know
concerning
the
things
which
they
spake
,
of
that
which
is
to
come
.
Now
Aaron
began
to
open
the
scriptures
unto
them
,
concerning
the
coming
of
Christ
,
and
also
concerning
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
,
and
that
there
could
be
no
redemption
for
mankind
,
save
it
were
through
the
death
and
sufferings
of
Christ
,
and
:
the
atonement
.
of
his
blond
.
And
it
came
to
pass
as
he
began
to
expound
these
things
unto
them
,
they
were
angry
with
him
,
aud
began
to
mock
him
;
and
they
would
not
hear
the
words
which
he
spake
;
therefore
,
when
he
saw
that
they
would
not
hear
his
-
words
,
he
departed
out
of
their
synagogue
,
and
ame
over
to
a
village
which
was
called
:
Ani
-
anti
,
and
there
he
found
Muloki
preaching
the
word
unto
them
;
andalso
Ammah
,
and
-
his
brethren
.
And
they
contended
with
many
about
the
word
.
And
[File:299]
it'came
to
pass
.
that
they
.
saw
:
that
the
.
people
.
would
harden
-
their
hearts
;
therefore
they
:
departed
,
and'came
over
into
the
land
of
Middoni
.
And
they
did
preach
the
:
word
unto
many
,
and
few
believed
on
the
words
which
they
taight
..
Nevertheless
,
Aaron
,
and
.
a
certain
number
of
his
brethren
,
were
taken
.
and
cast
into
prison
,
and
the
remainder
of
them
fled
out
of
the
land
of
Middoni
,
unto
the
regions
round
about
.
And
those
who
were
cast
into
prison
suffered
many
things
,
and
they
were
delivered
by
the
hand
of
Lamoni
and
Ammon
;
and
they
were
fed
and
clothed
.
And
they
went
forth
again
to
declare
the
word
;
and
thus
they
were
delivered
for
the
first
time
out
of
prison
;
and
thus
they
had
suffered
.
And
they
went
forth
whithersoever
they
were
led
by
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
,
preaching
the
word
of
God
in
every
synagogue
of
the
Amalekites
,
or
in
every
assembly
of
the
Lamanites
,
where
they
could
be
admitted
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
began
to
bless
them
,
insomuch
that
they
brought
:
many
to
the
know]edge
of
the
truth
;
yea
,
they
did
convince
many
of
their
sins
,
and
of
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
,
which
were
not
correct
.
And
it
came
to
pass
.
that
,
Ammon
and
Lamoni
returned
from
the
land
of
Middoni
,
to
the
land
of
Ishmael
,
which
was
the
land
of
their
inheritance
.
And
king
Lamoni
would
not
suffer
that
Ammon
:
should
serve
him
,
or
be
his
servant
;
but
he
caused
that
there
should
be
synagogues
built
in
the
land
of
Ishmael
;
and
he
eaused
that
his
people
,
or
the
people
who
were
under
his
reign
,
should
assemble
themselves
together
.
And
he
did
rejoice
over
them
,
and
he
did
teach
them
many
things
..
And
he
did
also
declare
unto
them
that
they
were
a
people
who
were
under
him
,
and
that
.
they
were
a
free
people
;
that
,
they
were
free
from
the
oppressions
of
the
king
,
his
father
;
for
that
his
father
had
granted
unto
him
that
he
might
reign
over
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
of
Ishmael
,
and
in
all
the
land
round
about
.
And
he
also
declared
unte
them
that
they
might
have
the
liberty
of
worshiping
the
Lord
.
their
God
,
according
to
their
desires
,
in
whatsoever
place
they
werein
,
if
it
were
in
the
land
which
was'
under
the
reign
of
king
Lamoni
.
And
Ammon
did
preach
unto
the
people
of
king
Lamoni
.:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
hedid
teach
them
all
things
concernng
things
pertaining
to
righteousness
.
And
he
did
exhort
them
daily
,
with
all
diligence
;
and
they
gave
[File:300]
heed
unto
his
word
,
and
they
were
zealous
for
keeping
the
commandments
of
God
.
Now
as
Ammon
was
thus
teaching
the
people
of
Lamoni
continually
,
we
will
return
to
the
account
of
Aaron
and
his
brethren
;
for
after
he
departed
from
the
land
of
Middoni
,
he
was
led
by
the
spirit
to
the
land
of
Nephi
;
even
to
the
house
of
the
king
which
was
over
all
the
land
,
save
it
were
the
land
of
Ishmael
;
and
he
was
the
father
of
Lamoni
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
went
in
unto
him
into
the
king's
palace
,
with
his
brethren
,
and
bowed
himself
before
the
king
,
and
said
unto
him
,
behold
,
O
king
,
we
are
the
brethren
of
Ammon
,
whom
thou
hast
delivered
out
of
prison
.
And
now
,
O
king
,
if
thou
wilt
spare
our
lives
,
we
will
be
thy
servants
.
And
the
king
said
unto
them
,
arise
,
for
I
will
grant
unto
you
your
lives
,
and
I
will
not
suffer
that
ye
shall
be
my
servants
;
but
[
will
insist
that
ye
shall
administer
unto
me
;
for
I
have
been
somewhat
troubled
in
mind
,
because
of
the
gencrosity
,
and
the
greatness
of
the
words
of
thy
brother
Ammon
;
and
1
desire
to
know
the
cause
why
he
has
.
not
come
up
out
of
Middoni
,
with
thee
.
And
Aaron
said
unto
the
king
,
behold
,
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
has
called
him
another
way
:
he
has
gone
to
the
land
of
Ishmael
,
to
teach
the
people
of
Lamoni
.
Now
the
king
said
unto
them
,
what
is
this
that
ye
have
said
concerning
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
?.
Behold
,
this
is
the
thing
which
doth
trouble
me
..
And
also
,
what
is
this
that
Ammon
said
.
if
ye
will
repent
ye
shall
be
saved
,
and
if
ye
will
not
repent
,
ye
shall
be
cast
off
at
the
last
day
?
And
Aaron
answered
him
and
said
unto
him
,
believest
thou
that
there
is
a
God
?
And
the
king
said
,
I
know
that
the
Amalekites
say
that
there
is
a
God
,
and
I
have
granted
unto
them
that
they
should
build
sanctuaries
,
that
they
may
assemble
themselves
together
,
to
worship
:
him
.
And
if
now
thou
sayest
there
isa
God
,
behold
,
1
will
believe
.
And
now
when
Aaron
heard
this
,
his
.
heart
began
to
rejoice
,
and
he
said
,
behold
,
assuredly
,
as
thou
livest
,
O
king
,
there
isa
God
.
And
the
king
said
,
is
Godthat
great
Spirit
that
brought
our
fathers
.
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
?
-
And
Aaron
said
unto
.
him
,
yea
,
he
is
that
great
.
Spirit
,
and
he
created
all
things
,
both
in
heaven
:
andin
earth
:.
believest
thou
this
?
And
he
said
yea
,
I
believe
.
that
the
great
.
Spirit
created
all
[File:301]
things
,
and
[
desire
that
ye
should
tell
me
concerning
all
taese
things
,
and
I
will
believe
:
thy
words
.
And
iteeame
to
pass
that
when
Aaron
.
saw
that
the
king
would
believe
his
words
,
he
began
from
the
creation
of
Adam
,
reading
the
scriptures
unto
the
-
king
;
how
God
created
man
after
his
own
i
:
nage
,
and
that
Goe
gave
him
commandments
,
and
that
because
of
transgression
,
man
had
fallen
.
And
Aaron
did
expound
unto
him
the
scriptures
,
from
the
creation
of
Adam
,
laying
the
fallof
man
before
him
,
and
their
carnal
state
,
and
also
the
plan
of
redemption
,
which
.
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
ofthe
world
,
through
Christ
;
for
all
whosoever
would
believe
on
his
name
.
.
And
since
man
had
fallen
,
he
could
not
merit
any
thing
of
himself
but
the
sufferings
and
death
of
Christ
atoneth
for
their
sins
,
through
faith
and
repentance
,
&c
.:
and
that
he
breaketh
the
bands
of
death
,
that
the
grave
shall
have
no
victory
,
and
that
the
sting
of
death
should
be
swallowed
up
in
the
hopes
of
glory
:
and
Aaron
did
expound
all
these
things
unto
the
king
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Aaron
had
expounded
these
things
unto
him
,
the
king
said
,
what
shall
do
,
that
1
may
have
this
eternal
life
of
which
thou
hast
spoken
?.
Yea
,;
ewhat
shall
I
do
,
that
I
may
be
born
of
God
,
haying
this
wicked
spirit
rooted
out
of
my
breast
,
and
receive
his
spirit
,
that
may
be
filled
with
joy
,
that
I
may
not
be
cast
off
at
the
last
day
?,
Behold
,
said
he
,
I
will
give
up
all
that
I
possess
;.
yea
,
I
will
forsake
my
kingdom
,
that
I
may
receive
this
great
joy
.
But
Aaron
said
unto
him
,
if
thou
desirest
this
thing
,
if
thou
wilt
bow
down
before
God
,
yea
,
if
thou
wilt
repent
of
all
thy
sins
,
and
will
bow
down
before
God
,
and
call
on
his
name
in
faith
,
believing
that
ye
shall
.
receive
,
then
shalt
thou
receive
the
hope
which
thou
desirest
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Aaron
had
said
these
words
,
the
king
did
bow
down
before
the
Lord
,
upon
his
knees
;
yea
,
even
he
did
prostrate
himself
upon
the
earth
,
and
cried
mightily
,
saying
,
O
God
,
Aaron
hath
told
me
that
-
there
isa
God
;
and
if
there
isa
God
,
and
if
thou
art
God
,
wilt
thou
make
thyself
known
unto
me
,
and
I
will
give
away
all
my
sins
to
know
thee
,
and
that
I
may
be
raised
from
the
dead
,
and
be
saved
atthe
last
day
.
And
now
when
the
king
had
said
these
words
,
he
was
struck
as
if
he
were
dead
.
And
it
.
came
to
pass
that
his
servants
ran
and
told
the
queen
.
ull
that
had
happened
unto
the
king
..
And
she
came
in
unto
the
king
;
and
when
she
saw
him
lay
[File:302]
as
if
he
were
dead
,
and
also
Aaron
and
his
brethren
standing
as
though
they
had
been
the
cause
of
hie
fall
,
she
wag
angry
with
them
,
and
commanded
that
her
servants
,
or
the
servants
of
the
king
,
should
take
them
and
slay
them
.
Now
the
servants
had
seen
the
cause
of
the
king's
fall
,
therefore
they
durst
not
lay
their
hands
on
Aaron
and
his
brethren
;
and
they
plead
with
the
queen
,
saying
,
why
commandest
thou
that
we
should
slay
these
men
,
when
behold
,
one
of
them
is
mightier
than
us
all
?
Therefore
we
shall
fall
before
them
.
Now
when
the
queen
saw
the
fear
of
the
servats
,
she
also
began
to
fear
exceedingly
,
lest
there
should
some
evil
come
upon
her
.
And
she
commanded
her
servants
that
they
should
go
and
call
the
people
,
that
they
might
slay
Aaron
and
his
brethren
..
Now
when
Aaron
saw
the
determination
of
the
queen
,
and
he
also
knowing
the
hardness
of
the
hearts
of
the
people
,
feared
lest
that
a
multitude
should
assemble
themselves
together
,
and
there
should
be
a
great
contention
,
and
a
disturbance
among
them
;
therefore
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
raised
the
king
from
the
earth
,
and
said
unto
him
,
stand
:
and
he
stood
upon
his
feet
,
receiving
his
strength
.
Now
this
was
done
in
the
presence
of
the
queen
,
and
many
of
the
servants
..
And
when
they
saw
it
,
they
greatly
marveled
,
and
began
to
fear
.
And
the
king
stood
forth
and
began
to
minister
unto
them
.
And
he
did
minister
unto
them
insomuch
that
his
whole
household
were
converted
unto
the
Lord
.
Now
there
was
a
multitude
gathered
together
because
of
the
commandment
of
the
queen
,
and
there
began
to
be
great
murmurings
among
them
,
because
of
Aaron
a
iia
brethren
.
But
the
king
stood
forth
among
them
,
and
administered
unto
them
.
And
they
were
pacified
towards
Aaron
,
and
those
who
were
with
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
king
saw
that
the
people
were
pacified
,
he
caused
that
Aaron
and
his
brethren
should
stand
forth
in
the
midst
of
the
mulltitude
,
and
that
they
should
preach
the
word
unto
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
sent
a
proclamation
throughout
all
the
land
,
amongst
all
his
people
who
were
in
all
his
land
,
who
were
in
all
the
regions
round
about
,
which
was
bordering
even
to
the
sea
,
on
the
east
,
and
on
the
west
,
and
which
was
divided
from
the
land
of
Zarahemla
by
a
narrow
strip
of
wilderness
,
which
ran
from
the
sea
east
;
evento
the
sca
west
,
and
round
about
on
the
borders
of
the
sea
shore
,
and
the
[File:303]
borders
of
the
wilderness
which
was
on
the
north
,
by
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
through'
the
borders
of
Mant
by
.
the
head
of
the
river
Sine
pasing
irons
theekat
towards
the
west
;
and
thus
were
the
Lamanites
.
and
the
Nephites
divided
.
â
Now
the
more
idle
part
of
the
Lamanites
lived
in
the
wilderness
,
and
dwelt
in
tents
;
andthey
were
spread
through
the
wilderness
,
on
the
west
,
in
the
land
of
Nephi
;
yea
,
and
also
on
the
west
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
in
the
borders
,
by
the
seashore
,
and
onthe
west
,
in
the
land
of
Nephi
,
in
the
place
of
their
fathers'
.
first
inheritance
,
and
thus
bordering
along
by
the
seashore
.
And
also
there
were
many
Lamanites
on
the
east
by
the
seashore
,
whither
the
Nephites
had
driven
them
.
And
thus
the
Nephites
were
nearly
surrounded
by
the
Lamanites
;
nevertheless
the
.
Nephites
had
taken
possession
of
all
the
northern
parts
of
the
.
land
,
bordering
on
the
wilderness
,
at
the
head
of
the
river
.
Sidon
,
from
:
the
east
to
the
West
,
round
about
on
the
wilderness
side
;
on
the
north
,
even
until
they
cameto
.
the
land
,
which
they
ealled
Bountiful
..
And
it
bordered
,
upon
the
Jand
which
they
called
Desolation
;
it
being
-
so
far
,
northward
that
it
came
into
:
the
land
which
had
been
peopet
and
been
destroyed
,
of
whose
bones
we
have
spoen
,
which
was
discovered
by
the
people
of
Zarahemla
;
it
being
the
place
of
their
first
landing
.
And
they
came
from
.
there
up
into
the
south
wilderness
.
Â©
Thus
the
land
on
the
northward
was
called
Desolation
,
and
the
land
on
the
southward
wascalled
Bountiful
;
1t
being
the
wilderness
which
is
filled
with
all
manner
of
wild
animals
of
every
kind
;
a
part
of
which
had
come
from
the
land
northward
,
for
food
.
And
now
it
was
only
.
the
distance
of
a
day
and
a
half's
journey
fora
Nephite
,-
on
the
line
Bountiful
,
and
the
land
Desolation
,
from
the
east
to
the
west
sea
;
and
thus
the
land
of
Nephi
,
and
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
were
nearly
surrounded
by
water
;
there
being
a
small
neck
-
of
land
between
the
land
northward
,
and
the
land
southward
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
had
inhabited
-
the
land
Bountiful
,
even
from
the
east
:
unto
:
the
west
sea
,
and
thus
the
Nephites
in
their
wisdom
,
with
their
guards
and
:
their
armies
;
had
hemmed
in
the
Lamanites
on
the
south
,
that
thereby
they
should
have
no
more
possession
on
the
nerth
,
that
they
.
might
not
'
overrun
the
land
northward
;
therefore
the
Lamanites
sould
have
no
more
possessions
only
in
the
land'
of
[File:304]
Nephi
,
and
:
the
wilderness
round
.
about
.
Now
this
yas
wisdomin
:
'the
Nephites
;
as
the
amanites
were
an
enemy
-
to
them
,
.
they
would
not

suffer
their
afflictions
on

,,
and
also
that
they
might
have
a

whither
they
might

CHAPTER
XIV
.
Braowun
,
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
sent
a
proclamation
among
all
his
people
,
that
they
should
notJay
their
hands
on
Ammon
,
or
Aaron
,
or
Omner
,
or
Himni
,
nor
neither
of
their
brethren
who
should
go
forth
preaching
the
word
of
God
,
in
whatsoever
place
they
should
be
,
in
any
part
of
their
land
;
yea
,
he
senta
decree
among
them
,
that
they
should
not
lay
their
hands
on
them
to
bind
them
,
or
to
cast
them
into
.
prison
;
neither
should
they'spit
upon
them
,
nor'smite
them
,
nor
cast
them
out
of
their
synagogues
,
nor
scourge
them
;
neither
.
should
they
east
stones
at
them
,
but
that
they
should
have
free
access
to
their
houses
,
'and
also
their
temples
,
and
their
sanctuaries
;
and
thus
they
might
.
go
forth
and
.
preach
the
word
according
to
their
desires
,
for
the
king
had
been
converted
:
unto
the
Lord
,
and
all
his
household
:
therefore
he
sent
this
proclamation
throughout
.
the
land
unto
his
people
,
that
the
word
of
God
might
haye
no
obstruction
,
but
that
.
it
might
go
forth
throughout
all
the
land
,
that
his
people
might
be
.
convinced
concerning
the
wicked
traditions
of
their
fathers
,
and
that
they
might
be'convinced
that
they
were
all
brethren
,
and
that
they
ought
-
not
to
murder
,
nor
-
to
plunder
,
nor
to
.
steal
,
nor
to
commit
adultery
,
nor
to
.
commit
any
manner
of
wickedness
:
And
now
it
eame
to
pass
that
when
the
king
had
sent
forth
:
this
proclamation
,
that
Aaron
and
his
brethren
went
forth
from
:
city
.
to
city
,
and
from
one
house
of
worship
to
another
,
establishing
churches
,
and
consecrating
:
priests
,
and
teachers
throughout
theland
among
the
Lamanites
,
to
preach
and
to'
teach
the
-
word
of
God
among
them
;
and
thus
they
began
to
have
great
success
.
And
thou
[File:305]
sands
were
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
Lord
,
yea
,
thousands
were
brought
to
believe
in
the
traditions
.
of
the
Nephites
;:
and
they
were
:
taught
the
.
records
-
and
the
prophecies
which
:
were
handed
down
,
even
-
tothe
present
time
;
and
ds
sure
as
:
the
:
Lord
liveth
,
so
:
sure
as
many
as
believed
,
or
as
many
as
were
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
,
through
the
preaching
of
Ammon
and
his
brethren
,
according
to
the
spirit
:
of
revelation
and
of
prophecy
,
and
the
power
of
God
,
working
miracles
in
them
;
yea
,
I
say
unto
you
,
'as
the
Lord
liveth
,
as
many
of
the
Lamanites
as
believed
in
their
:
preaching
,
and
were
converted
unto
the
Lord
,
never
did
fall
away
,
for
they
became
a
righteous
:
people
::
they
did
-
lay
.
down
the
weapons
of
their
rebellion
,
that
they
did
not
fight
against
God
-
any
more
,
neither
against
any
of
their
brethren
.
Now
these
are
.
they
who
were
converted
unto'the
Lord
:
the
people
of
the
Lamanites
who
were
in
the
land
of
Ishmael
,
and
also
ofthe
'people
:
of
the
:
Lamanites
who
were
in
the
land
of
Middoni
,
and
also
of
the
people
of
the
Lamanites
who
were
in
the
city
of
Nephi
,
and
also
of
the
people
of
the
Lamanites
eh
were
in
the
land
of
Shilom
,
and
who
were
in
the
land
of
Shemlon
,
and
in
the
city
of
Lemuel
,
and
in
the
-
city
of
Shimnilom
;.
and
these
are
the
-
names
of
the
cities
of
the
Lamanites
which
were
converted
unto'the
Lord
;
and
these
are
they
-
that
laid
)
.
down
the
weapons
of
their
rebellion
,
yea
,
all
their
weapons
of
war
;
and
they
were
all
.
Lamanites
:
And
the
:
Amalekites
were
not
converted
,
save
onlyone
;
neither
were
any
of
the
Amulonites
;
but
they
did
:
harden
their
hearts
,
and
also
the
hearts
of
the
Lamanites
in'that
part
of
the
land
wheresoever
they
dwelt
;
yea
,
and
all
their
.
villages
and
all
their
:
cities
;.
therefore
we
have
named
all
the
cities
.
of
:
the
Lamanites
in
which
they
did
repent
and
come
to
the
knowledge
of
.
the
trath
,
and
were
converted
.
roe
And
now
it
came
.
to
pass
that
the
king
and
,
those
who'
were
converted
,
were
desirous
that
they
might
have
a
name
,
that
thereby
the
might
be
distinguished
from
their
brethren
;
therefore
the
king
consulted

And
they
began
to'be
avery
-
industrious
people
:
yea
,
andthey
were
friendly
with
the
:
Nephites
;
therefore
[File:306]
they
did
open
:
a
correspondence
with
them
,
and
the
eurse

of
.
Goad
did
no
more
follow
:
them
.
And
it
came
to'
pass
.
that
:
the
Amalekites
,
and
the
Amulonites
,
and
the
Lamanites
were
in
.
the
land
-
of
Amalon
,
and
also'in
the
landof
Helam
,
and
who

were
in
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
and

about
,
who
had
not
been
converted
;
and
had
not
taken
.
upon
them
the
name
of'
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
,
were
stirred
up
by
the
Amalekites
,
and
-
by
the
Amulonites
,
to
anger
against
their
brethren
;
and
their
hatred
.
became
exceeding
sore
against
them
,
even
.
insomuch
that
-
they
-
begamto
-
rebel

against

their
king
,
insomuch'
that
they'
would
not
that

king
;
therefore
they
took
up
arms
against
the
people
of
Anti

Nephi
-

...
Now
the
king
conferred
:
the
kingdom
upon
his
son
and
hecalled
his
name
.
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
.
And
-
the
king
died
in
that
self
-
same
year
that
the
Lamanites
began
to
make
preparations
for
waragainst
the
people
of
God
...
Now
when
.
Ammon
and
:
his
brethren
,
and
all
those
who
had
come
up
with
him
,
saw
the
preparationsof
the
Lamanites
.
to
destroy
.
their
:
brethren
,
they
came
forth'to
the
land
of
Midian
,
and
there
Ammon
met
all
his
brethren
;
and
,
from
thence
they
came
to
the
land
of
Ishmael
,
that
they
might
hold
a
council
with
Lamoni
,
and
-
also
with
his
.
brother
Anti
-
NephiLehi
,
:
what
they
.
shoulddo
to
defend
.
themselves
against
the
Lamanites
.
.
Now
there
was
not
one
soul
among
all
the
people
who
had
been
converted
unto
the
Lord
;
that
would
take
up
arms
against
their
brethren
;
nay
,
they
Would
not
even
make
any
preparations
for
war
;
yea
,
and
also
their
king
commanded
them
that
they
should
.
not
.:.
Now
these'
are
.
the
words
which
he
said
unto
the
people
concerning
the
matter
:
I
thank
my
..
God
,
my
.
beloved
people
,
that
our
great
God
has
in
goodness
sent
these
our
brethren
,
the
Nephites
,
anto
us
to
:
preach
unto'us
,
and
to
convince
us
of
the
traditions
of
our
wicked
fathers
.
..
And
-
behold
,
I
thank
my
great
God
.
that
he
has
given
us
a
portion
of
his
spirit
to
soften
our
hearts
;
that
.
we
:
have
opened
&
Correspondence
with
these
brethren
,
the
Nephites
;
and
behold
,
I
also
thank
:
my
-
God
that
by
opening
this
_eorrespondence
we
have
been
convinced
of
,
our
sins
,
and
of
the
many
murders
.
which
we
have
committed
;
and
also
thank
my
God
,
yea
,
my
great
.
God
,
that
he
hath
granted
ante
us
-
that
we
might
repent
:
of
these
_
things
,
and
also
:
that
he
hath
forgiven
us
-
of
those
our
[File:307]
many
sins
:
and
.
murders
which
we
-
have
committed
,
end
took
away
the
guilt
from
our
hearts
,
through
the
merits
of
his
Son
...
And
now
:
behold
,:
my
:
brethren
,
since
it
has
been
all
that
we
could
do
,
(
as
.
we
were
.
the
most
lost
of
all
mankind
,)
to
repent
of
all
our
sins
and
:
the
many
murders
which
:
we
have
,
committed
,
and
to
get
God
to
take
them
away
from
our
hearts
,
for
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
repent
sufficiently
before
Gody
that
he
would
take
away
our
stain
.
Now
my
best
beloyed
brethren
,
since
God
hath
taken
away
our
stains
;
and
our
swords
have
become
:
bright
,
then
let
us
stain
our
swords
no
more
with
the
.
blood
.
of
our
brethren
:
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
,
let
us
retain
our
swords
,
that
they
be
not
stained
with
the
blood
of
our
brethren
:
for
perhaps
;
if
we
should
stain
our
swords
egain
,;
they
.
can
no
more
be
washed
.
bright
through
the
blood
of
the
Son
of
our
great
God
,
which
shall
be
shed
for
the
atonement
of
our
sins
...
And
the
great
God
hag
:
had
mercy
on
us
,
and
made
these
things
known
unte
us
,
that
we
might
not
perish
;
yea
,
and
he
has
made
these
things
.
known
unto
us
beforehand
,
beeause
he
loveth
our
souls
as
well
as
he
loveth
our
children
;
therefore
in
his
mercy
he
doth
visit
us
by
his
angels
,
that
the
plan
of
salvation
might
be
made
known
unto
us
as
well
as
unto
future
generations
.
O
.
how
mercifulis
our
-
God
!
And
now
behold
,
since
it
:
has
been
as
much
as
we
could
do
:
to
get
our
stains
taken
away
from
us
,
andour
-
swords
are
made
bright
,
let
us
-
hide
them
away
that
they
may
be
kept
bright
,
as
a
testimony
to
our
God
at
the
last
day
,
or
at
theday
that
:
we
shall
-
be
brought
to
stand
before
him
to
be
judged
,
that
we
have
not
stained
our
swords
in
the
blood
of
our
brethren
since
he
imparted
his
word
-
unto
us
,
and
hasâ
made
us
clean
thereby
.
.
And
now
my
brethren
;
if
our

brethren
seek
to
destroy
us
,
bebold
,
we
will
:
hide
away
our
swords
,
yea
,
even
we
will
bury
them
-
deep
in
the
earth
,
that
they
maybe
kept
bright
,
as
a
;
testimony
that
we
have
never
used
them
,
at
the
last
day
;
and
if
our
brethren
destroy
us
,
behold
,
we
shall
:
go
to
our
God
and
:
shall
be

And
new
it
came
:
to
pass
that
when
the
:
king
.
had
made
an
end
of
these
sayings
,
and
all
the
people
were
assembled
together
,
they
took
their
:
swords
;
and
.
all
the
weapons
:
which'
were
)
used
for
the
shedding
of
man's
blood
,
and
they
did
bury
them
up
deep
:
in
the
earth
;
and
this
:
they
did
,
it
being
:
in
-
their
view
a
testimony
to
God
,:
and
also'to
men
,
that
:
they
never
would
[File:308]
use
:
weapons
again
for
the
shedding
:
of
man's
:
blood
;:
and
this
they
did
,
vouching
and
covenanting
:
with
God
,
that
rather
than
shed
the
blood
of
their
brethren
,
they
would
give
up
their
own
lives
;
andrather
than
take
away
from
a
brother
,
they
would
.
give
unto
him
;
and
rather
than
spend
their
days
in
idleness
,
they
:
would
labor
abundantly
with
their
hands
;
and
thus
we
see
that
when
these
Lamanites
were
brought
to
believe
and
to
know
the
truth
,
they
were
firm
,
and
would
suffer
even
unto
death
,
rather
than
commit
sin
;
and
thus
we
see
,
that
they
buried
the
weapons
of
peace
,
or
they
buried
the
weapons
of
war
,
for
peace
.
And
it
.
came
to
pass
that
their
brethren
the
Lamanites
,
made
preparations
for
war
,
and
came
up
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
the
king
,
and
to
place
another
in
his
stead
,
and
also
of
destroying
the
people
of
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
out
of
the
land
.
Now
when
the
people
saw
that
they
were
coming
against
-
them
,
they
went
out
to
meet
them
,
and
prostrated
themselves
before
them
to
the
earth
,
and
began
to
call
on
the
name
of
the
Lord
;
and
thus
they
were
in
this
attitude
when
the
Lamanites
.
began
to
fall
upon
them
,
and
began
to
slay
them
with
tae
sword
;
and
thus
without
meeting
any
resistance
,
they
did
slay
a
thousand
and
five
of
them
;:
and
we
know
that
they
are
blessed
,
for
they
have
gone
to
dwell
with
their
God
.
Now
when
the
Lamanites
saw
that
their
brethren
would
not
flee
from
the
sword
,
neither
would
they
turn
aside
to
the
right
hand
:
or
to
the
lett
,
but
that
they
would
lie
down
and
perish
,
and
praised
God
even
in
the
weranct
of
perishing
under
the
sword
;
now
when
the
Lamanites
saw
this
,
they
.
did
forbear
from
slaying
them
;
and
there
were
many
whose
hearts
had
swollen
in
them
for
those
of
their
brethren
who
had
fallen
under
the
sword
,
for
they
repented
.
of
the
things
which
they
had
done
.
.
An
it
came
to
pass
that
they
threw
down
.
their
weapons
of
war
,
and
they
.
would
not
take
them
again
,
for
they
weresstung
for
the
marders
-
which
they
had
committed
;
and
they
came
down
even
:
as
their
brethren
,
relying
upon
the
mercies
of
those
whose
arms
were
lifted
to
:
slay
them
.
ox
And
itcame
:
to
:
pass
that
the
people
of
God
were
se
gence
that
day'
by
-
more
:
thanthe
number
-
who
had
en
slain
;
and
those
who
:
had
:
been
:
slain
were'righteous
people
;
therefore
we
have
no
reason
to
doubt
but
what
they
-
are
saved
:
And
there
was
not
awicked
[File:309]
man
slain
.
among
them
;
butitherewere'
more
.
than>a
thousand
brought
to
.
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
;
thas
we
see
that
the
:
Lord
worketh
in
.
many
ways
.
to
.
the
salvation
of
his
people
.
Now
,
the
greatest
number
of
those
of
the
Lamanites
who
:
slew
so
many
of
.
their
brethren
,
were
Amalexites
and
Amulonites
,
the
greatest
number
.
of
whom
were
after
the
order
of
the
.
Nehors
.
Now
among
those
who
joined
the
people
of
the
Lord
,
there
were
-
none
who
were
Amalekites
or
Amulonites
,
or
who
-
were
of
the
order
of
Nehor
,
but
they
were
actual
descendants
of
Laman
and
Lemuel
;
and
thus
we
can
plainly
discern
,
that
afler
a
people
have
been
once
enlightened
by
the
spirit
of
God
,
and
.
have
had
.
great
knowledge
of
things
pertaining
to
:
righteousness
,
and
then
have
fallen
away
into
-
sin'
and
transgression
,
they
become
more
.
hardened
,
and
.
thus
their
state
becomes
worse
than
though
they
had
never
known
these
things
.
;
we
.
And
behold
,
now
.
it
came
to
pass
that
those
Lamanites
.
were
more
angry
;
because
they
had
slain
their
brethren
;
therefore
they
swore
vengeance
upon
the
Nephites
;
and
they
did
no
more
attempt
to
slay
the
people
:
of
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
.
at
.
that
time
;
but
they
took
their
-
armies
and
-.
went
over
.
into
.
the
.
borders
..
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,.
and
fell
upon
the
.
peaple
.
who
were
in
the
Jand
of
Ammonibah
,
and
destroyed
:
them
.
And
after
that
,
they
had
.
many
battles
.
with
the
.
Nephites
,
in
-
the
which
they
were
driven
and
slain
;
and
among
the
Jamanites
who
,
were
slain
,.
were
,
almost
all
the
seed
of
Amulon
.
and
his
brethren
,
'
who
were
the
priests
.
of
Noah
,
and
they
were
slain
-
by
-
the
hands
.
ofthe
Nephites
;
and
the
remainder
.
having
fed
into
.
_
the
-
east
.
wilderness
,
and
.
having
usurped
the
power
and
:
authority
over
the
Lamanites
,
caused
that
many
of
the
,
Lamanites
.
should
.
perish
by
.
ire
,
because
:
of
their
belief
:
for
many
of
them
,
after
.
having
suffeted
much
:
loss
and
so
many
afflictions
,
began
to
be
stirted
up
insremembrance
of
the
words
which
.
Aaron
and
:
his
brethren
had
preached
to
them
in
their
land
;
.
therefore
they
began
to
disbelieve
the
traditions
of
their
.
fathers
,
and
to
believe
in
the
Lord
,
and
that
he
gave
great
power
unto
the
Nephites
;
and
.
thus
there
were
many
.
oftthem
:
converted
in
the
wilderness
...

a
bu
And
:
it
:
caine
to

pass
.
that
those
rulers
who
were
:
the
.
remnant
of
the
children
:
of
Amulon
;
caused
:
that
they
should
be
.
put
to
death
,:
yea
;
all
those
that
:
belieyedin
these
things
.
Now
:
this
martyrdom
caused
.
that
:
many
[File:310]
ef
their
brethren
should
be
stirred
up
to
anger
;
and
there
began
to
be
contention
in
the
wilderness
;
and
the
Lamanites
began
to
hunt
the
seed
-
of
Amulon
and
his
brethren
,
and
began
to
slay
them
,
and
they
fled
into
the
east
wildeness
.
And
behold
they
are
hunted
at
this
day
,
by
the
Lamanites
:
thus
the
words
of
Abinadi
were
brought
to
pass
,
which
he
said
concerning
the
seed
of
the
priesta
who
.
caused
that
he
should
saffer
death
by
fire
.
For
he
said
unto
,
them
,
what
ye
shall
do
unto
me
,
shall
be
a
type
of
things
to
come
.
And
now
Abinadi
was
the
first
that
suffered
death
by
fire
,
because
of
his
belief'in
God
:
now
this
is
what
he
meant
,
that
many
should
suffer
death
by
fire
,
according
as
he
had
suffered
.
And
he
-
said
unto
the
priests
of
Noah
,
that
their
seed
should
cause
many
to
be
put
to
death
,
in
the
like
manner
-
as
he
was
,
and
that
they
should
be
scattered
abroad
and
slain
,
even
as
a
sheep
having
no
shepherd
ig
driven
and
slain
by
wild
beasts
;
and
now
behold
,
these
words
.
were
verified
,
for
they
were
driven
by
the
Lamanites
,
and
they
were
hunted
,
and
they
were
emitten
.
And
it
-
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lamanites
saw
_that
they
could
not
overpower
the
Nephites
,
they
returned
again
to
their
own
land
;
and
many
of
them
came
over
to
dwell
in
the
land
of
Ishmael
and
the
land
-
of
Nephi
,
and
did
join
themselves
to
the
people
of
God
,
who
were
the
people
of
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
;
and
they
did
also
bury
their
weapons
of
war
,
according
as
their
brethren
had
,
and
they
began
to
be
a
righteous
people
;
and
they
did
walkin
the
ways
of
the
Lord
,
and
did
observe
to
keep
his
commandments
,
and
his
statutes
,
yea
,
and
they
did
keep
the
law
of
Moses
:
for
it
was
expedient
that
they
should
keep
the
law
of
Moses
as
yet
,
for'it
was
not
all
-
fulfilled
.
.
But
notwithstanding
the
law
of
Moses
,
they
.
did
look
forward
to
the
coming
of
Christ
,
considering
that
the
law
of
Moses
was
a
type
of
his
coming
,
and
believing
that
they
must
keep
those
outward
performances
,
until
the
time
that
he
should
be
revealed
unto
them
.
Now
they
did
not
suppost
tbat
salvation
came
by
the
law
of
Moses
;
but
the
law
of
Moses
did
serve
to
strengthen
their
faith
in
Christ
;
and
thus
they
did
retain
a
hope
through
:
faith
,
unto
eternal
salvation
,
relying
upon
the
spirit
of
prophecy
,
which
spake
of
those
hinge
to
.
come
.
And
now
behold
,
Ammon
,
.
andAaron
,
and
:
'Omner
,
and
Himni
,
and
their
brethren
,
did
rejoice
exceedingly
,
for
the
:
suceese
which
they
-
had
had
among
the
Lamanites
;
seeimg
[File:311]
that
the
Lord
-
had
granted
unto
them
according
to
their
prayers
,
and
that
he
had
also
verified
his
:
word
unto
them
in
every
particular
.
And
now
;
these
are
:
the
words
of
Ammon
to
his
brethren
,
which
say
thus
:
My
brothers
and
my
brethren
;
behold
I
say
unto
you
,
how
great
reason
have
we
to
:
rejoice
;
for
could
we
have
supposed
,
when
we
started
from
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
that
God
would
have
granted
unto
us
such
reat
blessings
?
And
now
ask
,
what
great
blessings
as
he
bestowed
upon
us
?
Can
ye
tell
?
Behold
,
I
answer
for
you
,
for
our
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
,
were
in
.
darkness
,
yea
,
even
in
the
darkest
abyss
;
but
behold
,
how
many
of
them
are
brought
to
behold
the
marvelous
.
light
of
God
!
Andthis'is
the
blessing
which
hath
been
bestowed
upon
us
,
that
we
have
been
made
instruments
in
the
hands
of
God
,
to
bring
about
this
:
great
work
.
Behold
,
thousands
of
them
do
:
rejoice
,
and
have
been
brought
into
the
fold
of
God
.
Behold
,
the
field
was
ripe
,
and
blessed
are
ye
,
for
ye
did
thrust
in
the
sickle
,
and
did
reap
with
your
mights
,
yea
,
all
the
day
long
did
ye
labor
;
and
behold
the
number
of
your
sheaves
,
and
they
shall
be
gathered
into
the
garners
,
that
they
are
not
wasted
;
yea
,
they
shall
not
be
beaten
down
by
thestorm
,
at
the
last'day
;
yea
,
neither
-
shall
they
be
harrowed
up
by
the
whirlwinds
;
but
when
the
storm
cometh
,
they
shall
be
gathered
together
in
their
place
,
that
the
storm
cannot
penetrate
to
them
;
yea
,
neither
shall
they
be
driven
with
fierce
winds
,
whithersoever
the
enemy
listeth
to
carry
them
.
But
behold
,
they
are
in
the
handsof
the
Lord
of
the
harvest
,
and
they
are
his
;
and
he
will
raise
them
up
at
the
last
day
.
Blessed
be
the
name
of
our
God
;
let
us
sing
to
-
his
praise
,
yea
let
us
give
thanks
to
his
holy
name
,
for
he
doth
work
righteousness
forever
.
.
For
if
we
had
not
come
up
out
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
these
our
dearly
beloved
brethren
,
who
have
so
dearly
beloved
us
,
would
still
have
been
racked
with
hatred
against
us
,
yea
,
and
they
would
also
have
been
strangers
to
God
.
:
;
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Ammon
had
said
these
words
,
his
brother
Aaron
rebuked
him
,
saying
:
Ammon
,
I
fear
-
that
thy
joy
doth
carry
thee
away
unto
boasting
.
-
But
Ammon
said
unto
him
,
Ido
not
boast
in
my
own
strength
,
or
in
my
own
wisdom
;
but
behold
,
my
joy
is
full
;
yea
,
my

Now

Yea

I

there

unto

my

for
he
has
all

all

he

those
who'will

Now
if

this
is

even

CHAPTER
XV
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
those
Lamanites
who
had
gone
to
war
against
the
Nephites
,
had
found
,
after
their
many
struggles
to
-
destroy
them
,
that
it
was
in
vain
to
-
seek
their
destruction
,
they
returned
again
to
the
land
of
Nephi
.
.
And
itcame
:
to
.
pass
that
the
Amalekites
,
because
of
their
-
loss
,
were'exeeeding
angry
.
And
when
they
saw'
that
they
could
not
seek
revenge
from
the
Nephitesy
they
began
to
stir
up
the
[File:315]
people
in
anger
against
their
:
brethren
,
the
people'
of
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
;
therefore
they
began
again
to'
deatroy
them
.
Now
this
people
again
Â¥efused
to
take
their
arms
,
and
they
suffered
themselves
to
be
slain
aceording
to
the
desires
of
their
enemies
.
'
Now
when
Ammon
and
his
brethren
saw
this
work
of
destruction
among
those
who
they
so
dearly
beloved
,
and
among
those
who
had
so
dearly
beloved
them
;
'
for
they
were
treated
as
though
they
were
angels
sent
from
Godto
save
them
from
everlasting
destruction
;
therefore
,
when
Ammon
and
his
bretbren
saw
this
great
work
-
of
destruction
,
they
were
moved
with
compassion
,
and
they
said
unto
the
king
,
let
us
gather
together
thie
people
of
the
Lord
,

down

the
land
of
Zarakemla
,
to
our

the
Nephites

and
fiee
out
of
the
:
hands
of
our
enemies
,
that
we
be
not

destroyed

But
the
king
said
unto
them
,
behold
,
the
Nephites
will
desiroy
us
,
because
of
the
many
murders
and
sins
we
have
committed
against
them
.
And
Ammon
said
,
I
will
go
and
inquire
of
the
Lord
,
and
if
he
say
unto
us
,
go
down
unto

our

will
ye
go

And
the
king
said
:
unto
him
yea
;
if
the
Lord
saith
unto
us
go
,
we
will
go
down
unto
our

and
we
will
be
their
slaves
until'
we
repair
unto
them
the
many
murders
and
sins
which
we
have
committed
against
them

But
Ammon
said
unto
him
,
itisagainst
the
law
of
our
brethren
,
which
was
established
-
by
my
father
,
that
there
should
be

among
them
;
therefore
let
us
go
down
and
rely
upon
the

of
our

But
the
king
said
unto
him
,

of
the
Lord

and
if

saith
unto

And
it
came
to
pass
that
Ammon
went
and
inquired
of
the
Lord
,
and
the
Lord
said
unto
him
,
get

And
nowt
came
to

that
Ammon
went
and
told
the
king
all
the
words
which
the

had
said
unto
him

And'
they
gathered

all

did
gather
together
all

and
departed
out

and
came
into'
the
wilderness
which
divided
the
[File:316]
jand
of
Nephi
from
the
land
of

and

came

And
it
-
came
to
pass
.
that
Ammon
said
unto
them
,
behold
;
I
and
my
.
brethren
:.
will
:
go
forth
into
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,-
and
ye
shall
remain
:
here
until
.
we
return
;
and
we
will
.
try
the

hearts
.
of
.
our
brethren
,
whether
they
will
that
,
ye
shall
come
into

_And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
Ammon
was
-
going
forth
into
the
land
,
that
-
he
and
his
.
brethren
met
Alma
,
over
in
the
place
of
,
which
..
has
been
spoken
;
and
.
behold
,
this
was
a
joyful
meeting
,
Now
-
the
joy
of
Ammon
was
so
great
,
even
that
he
was
.
full
;
yea
,
he
.
was
swallowed
.
up
in
:
the
joy
of
his
.
God
,
even
to
the
exhausting
of
his
.
strength
;
and
he
feilagain
to
the
earth
,
Now
.
was
not
thisexceeding
joy
?
Behold
,
this
.
is
joy
which
none
receiveth
save
it
be
the
truly
penitent
and
humble
:
seeker
.
of
happiness
.
Now
the
joy
of
Alma
in
meeting
his
brethren
was
truly
great
,
and
also
the
joy
of
.
Aaron
,
of
Omner
,
and
Himni
;
but
.
behold
,.
their
joy
.
was
not
.
that
to
exceed
their
strength
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
conducted
his
brethren
back
to
the
land
.
of
Zarahemla
;.
even
to
his
own
house
.
And
they
went
and
told
the
chief
judge
all
the
things
that
had
happened
unto
them
in
the
land
of
Nephi
among
their
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
chief
judge
sent
a
proclamation
throughout
all
.
the
land
,
desiring
the
voice
of
the
people
concerning
the
admitting
their
brethren
,
who
were
the
people
of
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
..
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
.
the
people
came
,
saying
,
behold
,
we
will
give
up
the
land
of
Jershon
,
which
is
on
the
east
by
the
sea
,
which
joins
the
land
Bountifal
,
which
.
is
on
the
south
of
the
tand
Bountiful
;
and
.
this
land
Jershon
is
the
,
land
.
which
we
will
give
unto
.
our
brethren
for
an
inheritance
.
And
.
behold
,
we
.
will
set
our
armies
between
the
land
Jershon
and
the
land
.
Nephi
,
that
we
may
protect
,
our
brethren
in
the
land
Jershon
;
and
this
we
do
.
for
our
brethren
,
on
account
of
their
:
fear
to
take
.
up
.
arms
against
.
their
brethren
,
lest
they
should
commit
sin
:
and
this
their
great
fear
came
,
because
of
their
..
sorerepentance
.
wliich
they
.
had
,
on
account
of
\their
.
many/murders
,
and
.
their
awful
wickedness
.
-
And
now
.
.
behold
,
this
,
will
.
we
.
do
-
unto
our
brethren
,
that
they
:
may
inherit

Jershon
;
and
,
wewill
guard

them
from

on
conditions'they

us

that

[File:317]
Now
-
it
came
!
to
pass
:
that
,
when
Amoron
:
had
heard
.
this
;
he
returued
.
to
the
:
people
,
of
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
,,
and
also
.
Alma
with
him
,-
into
,
the
wilderness
,.
whence
:
they
had
pitched
their
tents
,.
and
.
made
known
unto
them
all
these
things
.;.
And
,
Alma
also
related
.
unto
them
:
his
conversion'
with
Ammon}
and
Aaron
,-
and
his
brethren
.
-
And
it
came
,;
to
.
pass
that
it
did
cause
great
joy
among
them
..
And
:
they
,
went
,.
down
,
into
.
the
land
of
Jershon
,
and
took
.
possession
of
the
land
.
of
Jershon
;
and
they
were
.
called
.
bythe
.
Nephites
.
the
people
of
Ammon
:
-
therefore
.
they
were
distinguished
by
that
name
ever
,.
after
;
and
they
were
.
among
:
the
people
of
Nephi
,
and
also
numbered
among
.
the
.
people
who
wereof
the
church
of
God
.
..
And
they
:
were
also
.
distinguished
for
their
zeal
towards
.
God
,
and
,
algo
towards
men
;
for
they
were
,
perfectly
honest
..
and
,.
upright
:
in
all
things
;
and
they
,.
were
firm
.
in
.
the
:
faith
of
Christ
,
even
unto
the
end
.
.
And_they
did
look
upon
shedding
the
blood
of
their
brethren
.
with
the
.
greatest
abhorence
;
and
they
:
never
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
take
-
up
.
arms
against
their
.
brethren
;..
and
..
they
:
never
did
:
look
upon
death
with
any
degree
of
terror
for
their
hope'and
views
of
Christ
and
the
resurrection
;.
therefore
death
was
swallowed
pp
to
-
them
by
.
the
victory
of
Christ
over
-
it
;
therefore
they
would
suffer
,
death
.
in
the
most
aggravating
and
:
distressing
.
manner
:
which
eould
be
inflicted
by
their
brethren
,
before
they
would
take
the
sword
orsthe
cimeter
to
.
smite
.
them
...
And
thus
they
were
a
zealous
and
beloved
people
,
a
highly
favored
people
.
of
the
Lord
,
agos'he
Ssh
a
paapee
And
.
now
it
came
.
to
pass
that
after
the
.
people
of
Amnion
were
established
in
.
the
land
-
of
Jershon
,
and
a
charch
also
established
in
.
the
land
.
of
Jershon
;
and
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
were
set
.
round
.
about
the
and
of
Jershon
;
yea
,
in
all
the
borders
round
about
:
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;.
behold
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
:
had
followed
their
brethren
into
.
the
wilderhess
.
-
Andthus
.
there
was
a
tremendous
battle
;
yea
,
\
even
such
an
one
as
never
had
been
known
among
alk
the
peoplein
.
the
land
from
the
time
Lehi
left
Jerusalem
;
-
yea
;:
and
tens
of
thousands
of
.
the
Lamanites
were
slain
-
and
scattered
-
abroad
.
Yea
,
and
.
also
there
was
a
tremendous
:
slaughter
.
among
the
people
of
Ne
.
phi
;
nevertheless
,
the
--
Lamanites
were
.
driven
and
scattered
,
and
the
people
of
Nephi
returned
,
again
to
their
land
.
And
now
this
.
was
.
a
time
that
,
there
wag
&
great
mourning
.
and
lamentation
heard
throughout
[File:318]
all
the
land
,
among
all
the
people
of
Nephi
;.
yea
,
the
cry
of
widows
mourning
for
their
husbands
,
and
also
of
fathers
mourning
for
their
sons
,
and
the
daughter
for
the
brother
;
yea
,
the
brother
for
the
father
:
and
thus
the
cry
of
mourning
was
heard
among
every
one
of
them
:
mourning
for
their
kindred
who
had
been
slain
.
And
now
surelythis
was
a
sorrowful
day
;
yea
,
a
time
of
solemnity
,
and
a
time
of
much
fasting
and
prayer
:
and
thus
endeth
the
fifteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
-
of
Nephi
;
and
this
is
the
account
of
Arnmon
and
his
brethren
,
their
journeyings
in
the
land
of
Nephi
,
their
sufferings
in
the
land
,
their
sorrows
,
and
their
afflictions
,
and
their
incomprehensible
joy
,
and
the
reception
and
safety
of
the
brethren
in
the
land
of
Jershon
.
And
now
may
the
Lord
,
the
Redeemer
of
all
men
,
bless
their
-
souls
forever
.
And
this
is
the
account
of
the
wars
and
contentions
among
the
Nephites
,
and
also
the
wars
between
the
Nephites
and
the
Lamanites
;
and
the
fifteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
is
ended
;
and
from
the
first
year
to
the
fifteenth
,
has
brought
to
pass
the
destruction
of
many
thousand
Jives
;
yea
,
it
has
brought
to
pass
an
awful
scene
of
bloodshed
;
and
the
bodies
of
many
thousands
are
laid
low
in
the
earth
,
while
the
bodies
of
many
thousands
are
mouldering
in
heaps
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
;
yea
,
and
many
thousands
are
mourning
for
the
loss
of
their
kindred
,
because
they
have
reason
to
fear
,
according
to
the
promises
of
the
Lord
,
that
they
are
consigned
to
a
state
of
endless
wo
;
while
many
thousands
of
others
truly
mourn
for
the
loss
of
their
kindred
,
yet
they
rejoice
and
exult
in
the
hope
,
and
even
know
,
according
to
the
promises
of
the
Lord
,
that
they
are
raised
to
dwell
at
the
right
hand
of
God
,
in
.
a
state
of
never
ending
happiness
:
and
thus
we
see
how
great
the
inequality
of
man
is
because
of
sin
and
transgression
,
and
the
power
of
the
devil
,
which
comes
by
the
cunning
plang
which
he
hath
devised
to
ensnare
the
hearts
of
men
;
and
.
thus
we
see
the
great
eall
of
diligence
of
men
to
labor
in
the
vineyards
of
the
Lord
;
and
thus
we
see
the
great
reason
of
sorrow
,
and
also
of
rejoicing
:
sorrow
because
of
:
death
and
destruction
among
men
,
and
joy
because
of
the
light
of
Christ
unto
life
.
O
that
I'were
an
angel
,.
and
could
have
the
wish
of
mine
heart
,
that
.
I
.
might
go
forth
and
speak
with
the
trump
of
God
,
with
a
voice
to
shake
the
earth
,
and
cry
repentance
untovevery
people
;
yea
,
.
1
-
would
declare
unto
every
soul
;
as
with
the
voice
of
thunder
,
[File:319]
repentance
,
and
the'
plan
of
redemption
,
that
they
should
repent
and
come
unto'
our
God
,
that
there
might
not'
be
more
sorrow
upon'
all
the
face
of
the
earth
.
But
behold
,
I'am
a
nian
,
and
do
sin
in
my
:
wish
;
for
I
ought
to
be
content
with
the
things
which
the
Lord
hath
allotted
unto
me
.
I
ought
not
to
harrow
up
in
my
desires
,
the
firm
decree
of
a
just
God
,
for
I
know
that
he
granteth
unto
men
according
to
their
desire
,
whether
it
be
unto
death
or
unto
life
;
yea
,
I
know
that
he
allotteth
unto
men
,
according
to
their
wills
;
whether
they
be
unto
salvation
or
unto
eestruction
;
yea
,
and
I
know
that
good
and
evil
have
come
before
all
men
;
or
he
that
knoweth
not
good
from
evil
is
blameless
;
but
he
that
knoweth
good
and
evil
,
'
to
him
it
is
given
according
to
his
desires
;
whether
he
desireth
good
or
evil
,
life
or
death
,
joy
or
remorse
of
conscience
.
Now
seeing
that
I
know
these
things
,
why
should
I
desire
more
than
to
perform
the
work
to
which
I
have
been
ealled
?
Why
should
I
desire
that
I
was
an
angel
,
that
I
could
speak
unto
all
the
ends
of
the
earth
?.
For
behold
,
the
Lord
doth
grant
unto
all
nations
,
of
their
own
nation
and
tongue
,
to
teach
his
word
;
yea
,
in
wisdom
,
all
that
he
seeth
fit
that
the
should
have
;
therefore
we
see
that
the
Lord
do
counsel
in
wisdom
,
according
to
that
which
is
just
and
true
.
I
know
that
.
which
the
Lord
hath
.
commanded
me
,
and
I
glory
in
it
:
I
do
not
glory
of
myself
,
but
{
glory
in
that
which
the
Lord
hath
:
commanded
me
;
yea
,
and
this
is
my
glory
,
that
perhaps
I
may
be
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
God
,
to
bring
some
soul
to
repentance
;
and
this
ismyjoy
.
And
behold
,
when
I
see
many
of
my
brethren
truly
penitent
,
and
coming
to
the
Lord
their
God
,
then
is
my
soul
filled
with
joy
;
then
do
I
remember
what
the
Lord
:
has
done
for
me
;
yea
,
even
that
he
hath
heard
-
my
prayer
;
yea
;
then
do
I
remember
his
merciful
arm
which
he
extended
towards
me
;
yea
,
and
I
also
remember
the'
captivity
of
my
fathers
;
for
I
surely
do
know
that
the
:
Lord
did
deliver
them
out
of
bondage
,
and
by
this
didâ
establish
his
church
;
yea
,
the
Lord
God
,
the
God
of
Abraham
,
the
God
of
Isaac
;
and
the
God
of
Jacob
,
did
:
deliver
them
out
of
bondage
;
yea
,
I
have
always
re~
membered
the
captivity
of
my
fathers
:
and
that
same
God
who
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Epyp
-
'
tians
,
did
deliver
them
out'of
bondage
;
yea
,
and
at
same
God
did
establish
his'
church'
:
among'
them
;
yea
,
and
that

God
hath
called
me
by
a
holy
-
calling
,
ies
[File:320]
to
.
preach
the
word

unto'
.
this
people
,
and
hath
given
me
much
'suceess
,
in
the
.
which
my
joy
:
is
full
;
but
I
do
not
joy
inmy
own
.
suceess
alone
,
but
my
joy
is
more
full
because
of
the
success
of
my
brethren
,
who
have
been
up
-
to
the
land
of
Nephi
.
Behold
,
they
have
labored
exceedingly
,
and
.
have
brought
forth
much
fruit
;
and
how
great
shall
be
their
reward
.
Now
when
[
think
of
,
the
success
of
these
.
my
brethren
,
my
soul
is
carried
away
,
even
,
to
the
separation
of
it
from
.
the
body
,
as
it
were
,
so
great
is
.
my
joy
.
Aad
now
,
may
God
grant
unto
these
my
brethren
,
that
they
may
sit
down
inthe
kingdom
of
God
;
yea
,
and
also
all
those
.
who
are
the
fruit
of
their
labors
that
they
may
go
no
more
out
,
but
that
they
..
may
praise
him
forever
.
And
may
God
grant
that
it
may
be
done
according

my
words

CHAPTER
,
XVi
.
Bxxotn
,
now
it
came
.
to
-
pass
that
after
the
people
of
Ammon
were
established
in
,
the
land
of
Jershon
,
yea
,
and
also
after
the
Lamanites
were
driven
out
of
the
.
land
,
and
their
dead
were
buried
by
the
people
of
the
land
.
..
Now
,
their
dead
were
not
numbered
,
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
.
numbers
;
neither
were
the
dead
of
the
Nephites
numbered
.
But
it
came
to
pass
after
they
had
buried
their
dead
,.
and
.
also
after
.
the
days
of
fasting
,
and
mourning
,
and
prayer
,
(
and
it
was
in
the
sixteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,)
there
began
to
.
be
continual
peace
throughout
ail
the
land
,
yea
,
and
the
people
did
observe
to
keep
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
;
and
they
were
strict
in
observing
the
.
ordinances
of
God
,
according
to
-
the
law
,
of
Moses
;
for
they
were
taught
.
to
,
keep
the
law
of
.
Moses
,
until
it
.
should
be
fulfilled
;
and
thus
.
the
people
did
have
no
disturbance
in
.
all
the
,
sixteenth
year
.
of
the
-
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
vik

:
And
it
came
.
to
pass
in
the
.
seventeenth
.
year
.
of
the
.
reign
of
the
.
judges
,
there
was
.
continual
:
peace
,
But
it
came
to
,
pass
.
inthe
latter
,
end
.
of
the
seventeenth
year
,
there
came
.
a
man
,
into
.
the
:
land
of
Zarahemlaj
.,
and
he
.
was
.
Anti
-
Christ
,
fon
-
he
ibegan
:
to
,
preach
unto
.
[File:321]
the
people
against'
the
prophedies
which
had
been
:
spoken
by
the
prophets
,
concetning'
the
coming
-
of
Christ
.
.
Now
there
was
no
law
against
a
man's
belief
:
for
it
was'
strictly
contrary
to
the
commands
of
God
,
that
there
should
bea
law'
which
should
:
bring'men
on
to
unequalgrounds
:-
For
thus
saith
the
:
scripture
;
Choose
ye
thisday
,
whom
ye
will
serve
,
Now
if
a
man
desired
to
serve
God
;
it
was
his
privilege
;
or
rather
if
hebelieved'in
God
,
it
was
:
his
:
privi
-
'
lege
to
serve
him
;
but
if
he
did
not
.
believe
in
him
;
there
was
no
law
to'
punish
him
.
But
if
he
murdered
,
he
was
punished
unto
death
;
and
if
he
robbed
,
he
wag
algo
punished
;
arid
if
he
stole
,
he
was
also
punished
;
and'if
he
committed
adultery
,
he
was
also
punished
:
yea
,
forall
this
wickedness
,
they
were'
punished
:
for
there
was
a
law
;
that
men
should
be
judged
according
to
their
verimes
:
Nevertheless
;
there
:
was
no
law
against
a
man's
belief
;
therefore
,
a
manwas
punished
only
for
the
crimes
which
he
bad
done
;
therefore
all
men
were
onâ
eqaal
grounds
.
And
:
this
.
Anti
-
Christ
,
whose
name
was
Korihor
,
(
and
the
law
could
have
no
hold
upon
him
,)
began
to
preach
unto
the
people
,
that
there
should
be
no
-
Christ
:
And
after
this
manner
did
he'preach
,
saying
:
O
ye
that'
are
bound
down
under
a
foolish
and'a
vain
hope
,
why
do
ye
yoke
yourselves
with'such
foolish
things
?
Why
do
ye
look
fora
Christ
?
'
For
no'
mancan
know
of
.
any
thin
which
is
to'come
.
Behold
,
these
things
which
ye
call
prophecies
,
which
ye
say
are
handed
down
by
holy
prophets
,
behold
,
they
are
foolish
.
traditions'
of
your
fathers
.
How
do
ie
know'of
their
-
surety
?
~
Behold
,
ye
-
cannot
know
of
things'which
ye
do
not
see
;
therefore
ye
cannot
know
that
there
shall
be
a
Christ
.
'
Ye
look
forward
and
-
say
,
that
ye
see
-
a
remission
of
your
sins
.
But
behold
,
it
-
is
the
effect
of
a
phrensied
mind
;
and
this
derangement
of
your
minds'comes
because
of
the
tradition
of
your
fathers
,
which
lead
youwaway
in=
to'a
belief
of
things'
which
are
notso
.
And
many
more
such
things
did
:
he
say
unto
them
,
telling
them
that
there
could
be
no
atonement
made'
for
the
sins
of
men
,
but
every
man
fared
in
this
life
;
according
to
the
mariagement
of
-
the
creature
;
thereforeâ
every
:
man
prospered
according
to
his
genius
,
and
that/every
man
conquered
ateording
toâ
his
strength
;
and
whatsoever
aman
did
,
wasno
trimesâ
And
thus
he'
did
preach
unto
them
,
leading
away
the
hearts
of
many
;
causing
them
to
liftup
their
heads
in'their
wickedness}
:
yea
,
[File:322]
leading
away
many
women
,
and
also
.
men
,
to
.
commit
whoredoms
;
telling
them
,
that
when
:
a
man
was
.
dead
,
that
was
the
end
.
thereof
,
'
Now
.
this
man
went
over
to
.
the
land
of
Jershon
al80
,
to
preach
these
things
among
the
people
of
Ammon
,
who
were
,
once
the
people
of
the
Lamanites
,
But
behold
,
they
were
more
wise
than
.
many
of
the
Nephites
;
for
they
took
him
,
and
bound
him
,
and
carried
him
before
Ammon
,
who
was
a
high
priest
over
that
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
caused
that
.
he
should
be
carried
out
of
the
land
.
And
he
came
over
into
the
land
of
Gideon
,
and
began
to
preach
.
unto
them
also
;
and
here
he
did
not
have
much
success
,
for
he
was
taken
and
bound
,
and
carried
before
the
high
priest
,
and
also
the
chief
judge
over
the
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
high
priest
.
said
unto
him
,
why
do
ye
go
about
perverting
the
ways
of
the
Lord
?
Why
do
ye
teach
this
people
that
there
shall
be
no
Christ
,
to
interrupt
their
rejoicings
?.
Why
do
ye
speak
against
all
the
prophecies
of
the
holy
.
prophets
?)
Now
the
high
priest's
name
was
Giddonah
..
And
-
Korihor
said
unto
him
,
because
I
..
do
.
not
.
teach
the
foolish
traditions
of
your
fathers
,
and
because
I
do
not
teach
this
people
to
bind
themselves
down
under
the
foolish
ordinances
and
performances
.
which
are
laid
down
by
ancient
priests
,
to
usurp
power
and
authority
over
them
,
to
keep
them
in
ignorance
,
that
they
may
not
lift
up
their
heads
,
but
be
brought
down
according
to
thy
words
.
Ye
say
that
this
people
isa
free
people
.
Behold
,
I
say
they
are
in
bondage
.
Ye
say
that
those
ancient
prophecies
are
true
.
Behold
,
I
say
that
ye
do
not
know
that
they
are
true
.
Ye
say
that
this
people
isa
guilty
and
a
fallen
people
,
because
of
the
transgression
of
a
parent
.
Behold
,
I
say
that
.
a
child
is
nat
guilty
because
of
its
parents
.
And
ye
also
say
that
Christ
shall
come
.
But
behold
,
I
say
that
ye
do
not
know
that
there
shall
be
a
Clirist
.
And
ye
say
also
,
that
he
shall
be
slain
for
the
sins
of
the
world
;
and
thus
ye
lead
away
this
people
.
after
the
foolish
traditions
of
yo
fathers
,
and
according
to
your
own
desires
;
and
ye
keep
them
down
,
even
as
it
were
,
in
bondage
,
that
ye
may
glut
yourselves
with
the
labors
of
their
hands
,
that
:
they
:
durst
not
look
up
with
.
boldness
,:
and
that
,
they
-
durst
not
enjoy
their
rights
:
and'
privileges
;
yen
,
they
durat
not
make
use'of
that
which
is
their
own
,
lest
they
should
offend
[File:323]
their
priests
;
who
do
yoke
them
according
to
their
desires
,
and'
have
brought
them
to
believe
by
their
traditions
,
and
their
dreams
,
and
their
whims
,
and
:
their'
visions
,
and
their
pretended
mysteries
,
that
they
should
,
if
they
did
not'do
according'
to
:
their
words
,
offend
some
unknown
being
,
who
they
say
is
God
;
a
being
who
never
has
been
seen
nor
known
,
who
ney~
er
was
nor
ever
will
be
.
Now
when
the
high
priest
and
the
chief
judge
saw
the
hardness
of
his
heart
;
yea
,
when
they
saw
that
he
would
revile
even
against
God
,,
they
would
not
make
any
reply
to
his
words
;
but
they
caused
that
he
should
be
bound
;
and
they
delivered
him
up
into
the
hands
-
of
the
officers
,
and
,
sent
him
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
that
he
might
:
be
brought
before
Alma
,
and
the
chief
judge
,
who
was
governor
over
all
the
land
.
3
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
was
brought
before
Alma
and
the
chief
judge
,
he
did
go
on
in
the
same
manner
as
he
did
in
the
land
of
Gideon
;
yea
,
he
went
on
to
blaspheme
.
And
he
did
rise
up
im
.
great
swelling
words
before
Alma
,
and
did
revile
against
the
priests
and
teachers
,
accusing
them
of
leading
away
the
people
after
the
silly
traditions
of
their
fathers
,
for
the
sake
of
glutting
in
the
labors
of
the
people
..
Now
Alma
said'
unto
Sim
,
thou
-
knowest
that
we
do
not
:
glut
ourselves'upon
the
labors
of
this
people
;
for
behold
;
Ihave
labored
even
from
the
commencement
ofthe
reign
:
of
the
judges
,
until
now
,
with
mine
own
hands
,
for
my
support
,
notwithstanding
my
many
travels
.
round
about
the
land
,
to'
declare
.
the
word
of
God
unto
my
people
.
And
notwithstanding
the
many
labors
which
I
have
performed
:
in
the
church
,
I
have
never
received
so
much
as
.
even
.
one
senine
for
my
labor
;
neither
has
any
of
my
brethren
,
save'
it
were
in
the
judgment
seat
;
and
then
we
have
received
only
according
to
law
,
for
our
time
..
And
now
if
we
do
not
receive
any
thing
for
our
labors
in
the
church
,
what
doth
it
.
profit
us
to
labor
in
:
the
church
,
save
it
were
to
declare
the
truth
,
that
we
may
have
rejoicings
:
in
the
joy
of
our
brethren
?
Â©
Then'
why
sayest
:
thou
that
we
preach
unto
this
people
to
get
gain
,
when
thon
of
thyself
knowest
that
we
receive
no
gain
?
'
And
now
,
believest
thou
that
we
deceive
this
ople
;
that
causes
:
such
joy
in
:
their
hearts
?
And
orihor
answered
him
,
yea
.
And
then
Almasaid
unto
:
him
,
believest
thou
that
there'isia
God
?-
And
he
answered
,
nay
.
â
Now
Alma
saidunto
him
,
will
:
ye
[File:324]
deny
again
that
there
isa
:
God
,
and
also
.:
deny
the
)
Christ
?
for
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
I
-
know
there
isa
:
God
,
and
,
also
that
Christ
shall
.
come
.
And
-
now
,
what
evidence
have
ye
that
-
there
is
:
no
:
God
;
or
.
that
Christcometh
not
?
1
say
-
unto
a
that
ye
have
none
,
save
it
be
your
-
word
only
...
But
behold
;.
f
have
all
things
-
as
.
a
testimony
that
these
:
things
are
.
true
;
and
ye
also
have
all
things'as
a
testimony
unto
you
that
:
they
are
true
;
and
will
ye
-
deny
them
?
Beheyest
thou
that
these
things
are
true
?
Behold
,
1
.
know
that
thou
-
believest
,
but
:
thou
.
art
possessed
witha
lying
spirit
,
and
ye
haye
put
off
the
spiritvof
.
God
,
that
it
may
-
have
no
place
:
in
you
;..
but
-
the
devil
:
has
power
over
you
,
and
he
,
doth
carry
you
about
,
working
devices
,
that
he
may
destroy
:
the
.
children
of
God
.
And
now
Korihor
said
unto
Alma
,
if
thou
.
wilt
shew
mea
sign
,
that
I
may
.
be
convinced
that
there
is
a
God
,
ea
,
shew
unto
me
that
he
hath
power
,
and
then
will
Tbe
convinced
of
the
trath
of
:
thy
.
words
...
But
-
Alma
said
unto
him
,-
thou
-
hast
had
signs
.
enough
;
will
.
ye
tempt
your
God
?
Will
ye
say
;
shew
unto
me'a
sign
;
when
ye
have
the
testimony
:
of
all
-
these
:
thy
.
brethren
,
and
also
all
.
the
holy
prophets
?:.
The
scriptures
.
are
Jaid
before
thee
,
yea
,
and
all
things
denote
:
there
isa
God
;
yea
,
even
the
earth
,
and
all
things
:
that
are
upon
the
face
of
it
,
yea
,.
and
its
motion
;
yea
;,
and
.
also
all
.
the
planets
which
.
move
in
-
their
regular
form
,
doth
witness
that
there
is
a
Supreme
Creators
and
yet
do
ye
go
:
abont
,
leading
away
the
hearts
.
ofthis
:
people
,
testifying
unto
them
there
is
:
no
God
?
And
:
yet
will
ye
deny
against

all
these
witnesses
?
And
he
:
said
,
yea
,
Iwill
deny
,
except
ye
.
shall
shew
me

a
sign
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
:
Alma
:
said
unto
him
,
behold
,
-
am
grieved
,
because

of

Now
when

:-

was
struck

,
that

And
now
when
the
chief
judge
saw
this
;
he
putforth
his
hand
and
wrote
unto
Korihor
,
saying
:
art
:
thou

of
the

In

:

and
:

.
And
Koribor
:
put
forth
his
hand
,
and
wrote
,
saying
:
I

,

;
-
yea
,
and
.
I
also
knew
that
there
was

But
behold
the

deceived

;
forhe
appeared
-
unto
me
in
the
form
of

,
and
:
said

,
go

,
for
they
have
all
:
gone
astray
after

an

.
And
.
he
said
unto
me
,
there
isno

;
yea
,
and
he
taught
me
-
that
which
I
should
say
.
And
Phave
taught
his
words
;
and
Itaught
them
,
because
they
were
pleasing
unto'the
carnal
mind
;
and
Iitaught
them
,
even
-
until
I
-
had
much
suctess
,
insomuch
that
I
verily
believed
that
they
were
:
true
;)
and
:
for
this
cause
,
I
withstood
:
the
truth
,
even
until
I
-
have
hrought
this
great
curse
upon
-
mes
Now
.
whenhehad
.
said
this
,
he
besought
.
that
.
Alma
should
:
pray
unto
God
,:
that
the
curse
:
might
be
taken
from
:
him
.
But
Alma
said
unto
him
,
if
this
curse
should
be
taken
from
thee
,
thou
wouldest
again
lead
away
the
hearts
of
this
people
;
therefore
,
it
shall
-
be
:
unto
thee
,
even
:
as
:
the
Lord
willy
And
it'came
:
to
:
pass
that
the
curse
was'
not
taken
off
of
Kurihor
;
but
:
he
was
cast
out
,
and
:
went
about
from
house
to
-
house
,
begging
for
his
food
.
.
Now
the
knowledge
of
what
had
.
happened
unto
Korihor
,.
was
immediately
published
throughout
-
all
the
-
land
;.
yea
,
the
-
proclamation
was
-
sent
forth
by
the
chief
judge
;
to
all
the
people
:
in
the'land
,
declaring'
.
unto
those
,
who
hrad
:
believed
:
in
the
:
words
of
Korihor
,
that
they
must
speedily
repent
,
lest
the
same
:
judgments
would
:
come

And
it
came
to
-
pass
:
that
:-
they
were
:
all
:
convinced
of
the
:
wickedness
of
.
Korihor
;
Shorefore
:
they
were
alk
converted
again
unto'
the
.
Lord
;
and
this
put
an
end
[File:326]
to
.
the
iniquity
after
the
manner
of
.
Korihor
....
And
Korihor
did
go
about
from
house
to
house
,
begging
food
for
his
support
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
he
went
forth
among
the
people
,
yea
,
among
a
people
who
had
separated
themselves
from
the
Nephites
,
and
called
.
themselves
Zoramites
,
being
led
by
a
.
man
whose
name
was
Zoram
;
and
as
he
went
forth
amongst
them
,
behold
,
he
was
run
upon
,
and
trodden
down
,
even
until
he
was
dead
;
and
thus
we
see
the
end
of
him
who
perverteth
the
ways
of
the
Lord
;
and
thus
we
see
that
the
devil
will
not
support
his
children
at
the
last
day
,
but
doth
speedily
drag
them
down
to
hell
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
end
of
Korihor
,
Alma
having
received
tidings
that
the
Zoramites
were
perverting
the
ways
of
the
Lord
,
and
that
Zoram
,
who
was
their
leader
,
was
leading
the
hearts
of
the
people
to
bow
down
to
dumb
idols
,
&c
.,
his
heart
again
began
to
sicken
,
because
of
the
iniquity
of
the
people
;
for
it
was
the
cause
of
great
sorrow
to
Alina
,
to
know
of
iniquity
among
his
people
;
therefore
his
heart
was
exceeding
sorrowful
,
because
of
the
separation
of
the
Zoramites
.
from
the
Nephites
.
Now
the
Zoramites
had
gathered
themselves
together
in
a
land
which
they
called
Antionum
,
which
was
east
.
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
which
lay
nearly
bordering
upon
the
seashore
,
which
was
south
of
the
land
of
Jershon
,
which
also
bordered
upon
the
wilderness
south
,
which
wilderness
was
full
of
the
Lamanites
..
Now
the
Nephites
greatly
feared
that
the
Zoramites
would
enter
into
a
correspondence
with
the
Lamanites
,
and
that
it
would
be
the
means
of
great
loss
on
the
part
of
the
Nephites
.
And
now
,
as
the
preaching
of
the
word
hada
great
tendency
to
lead
the
people
to
do
that
which
was
just
;
yea
,
it
had
had
more
poweriul
.
effect
upon
the
minds
of
the
people
than
the
sword
,
or
any
thing
else
,
which
had
happened
unto
them
:
therefore
Alma
thought
it
was
expedient
that
they
should
try
the
virtue
of
the
word
of
God
.
.
Therefore
he
took
Ammon
,.
and
Aaron
,
and
Omner
;
.
and
Himni
.
hedid
-
leave
in
the
church
in
Zarahemla
;
but
the
former
.
three
he
took
with
him
,
and
.
also
.
Amulek
and
Zeezrom
;-
who
were
at
Melek
;
and
he
also
.
took
two
of
his
sons
:
i
.
Now
the
eldest
of
his
sons
he
took
not
with
him
;
and
his
name
.
was
:
Helaman
;
'
but
the
names
.
of
those
whom
he
took
:
with
shim
,
were
.
Shiblon
:
and
::
Corianton
;:
and
these
are
the
names
.
of
:
those
who
:
went
with
him
[File:327]
among
the
Zoramites
,
to
preach
unto
them
the
word
.
Now
the
.
Zoramites'
were
dissenters
from
the
Nephites
;
therefore
they
had
the
word
of
God
preached
unto
them
.
But
they
had
fallen
into
great
errors
,
for
they
would
not
observe
to
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
his
statutes
,
according
to
the
law
of
Moses
;
neither
would
they
observe
the
performances
of
the
:
church
,
to
continue
in
prayer
and
supplication
to
:
Ged
:
daily
,
that
they
might
not
enter
into
temptation
;
yea
,
in
fine
,
they
did
pervert
the
ways
of
the
Lord
in
very
many
instances
;
therefore
,
for
this
cause
,
Alma
and
his
brethren
went
.
into
the
land
,
to
preach
the
word
unto
them
,
Now
when
they
had
come
into
the
land
,
behold
,
to
their
astonishment
,
they
found
that
the
Zoramites
had
built
synagogues
,
and
that
they
did'
gather
themselves
together
on
one
day
of
the
week
,
which
day'
they
did
call
the
day
of
the
Lord
;.
and
they
did
worship
afler
a
manner
which
Alma
and
his
brethren
had
never
beheld
;
for
they
hada
place
built
up
in
the
centre
of
their
synagogue
,
a
place
for
standing
,
which
was
high
above
the
head
;
and
the
top
thereof
would
only
admit
one
person
.
Therefore
,
whosoever
desired
to
worship
,
must
go
forth
and
stand
upon
:
the'
top
thereof
,
and
stretch
forth
his
:
hands
towards
,
heaven
;
and
ery
with
a
loud
voice
;
saying
:
Holy
,
holy
God
;
we
believe
that
thou
art
God
,
and
we
believe
.
that
thou
art
holy
,
and
that
thou
wast
.
a
spirit
,
and
that'
thou
arta
spirit
,
and
that
thou
wilt
be
a
spirit
forever
,
Holy
God
,
we
believe
that
thou
hast
separated
us
from
our
brethren
;
and
we
do
not
believe
in
the
traattion
of
our
brethren
,
which
was
handed
down
:
te
them
by
the
childishness
of
their
fathers
;
but
we
believe
that
thou
hast
elected
us
to
be
thy
holy
children
;
and
also
thou
hast
made
it
known
unto
us
that
there
shall
-
be
no
Christ
;
but
thou
art
the
same
,
yesterday
,
to-day
,
and
forever
;
and
thou
hast
elected
us
,
that
we
shall
be
saved
,
whilst
all
around
us'areeleeted
to
be
cast
by
thy
wrath
down
to
hell
;
for
the
which'
holiness
,
O
God
,
we
thank
thee
;
and
:
we
also
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
elected
us
,
that
we
may
not
be
ledâ
away
after
the
foolish
traditions
of
our
brethren
,
which
doth
bind
them
down
to
a
belief
of
Christ
,
whichdoth
lead
their
hearts
to
wander
far'
from'
thee
,
our
God
:
And
again
:
'
We
thank

O

that

[File:328]
be
Now
it
.
came
.
to
pass
that
after
Alma
and
his
breth
ren
,
and
his
sons
,
had
:
heard
these
prayers
,
they
were
astonished
beyond
all
measure
.
For
benold
,
every
man
did
go
forth
and
offer
up
the
same
prayers
.
Now
the
place
was
-
called
by
.
them
.
Rameumptom
,
which
being
interpreted
,
is
the
Holy
Stand
.
Now
from
this
stand
,
they
did
offer
up
,
every
man
,
the
.
self
-
same
prayer
unto
God
,
thanking
their
God
that
they
were
chosen
of
him
,
and
that
.
he
-
did
not
lead
them
away
after
the
tradition
of
their
brethren
;
and
-
that
their
hearts
were
not
stolen
away
to
believe
in
things
to
come
,
which
they
knew
nothing
about
.
Now
after
the
people
had
all
offered
up
thanks
after
this
manner
,
they'
returned
to
their
homes
,
never
speaking
of
their
God
again
,
until
they
had
assembled
themselves
together
again
,
to
the
holy
stand
,
to
.
offer
up
thanks
after
their
-
manner
...
Now
when
.
Alma
saw
this
,
his
heart
was
grieved
:
for
he
saw
that
they
were
a
wicked
:-
and
a
perverse
people
;
yea
,
he
saw'
that
their
hearts
were
set
upon
gold
,
and
upon
silver
,
and
upon
all
manner
of
fine
goods
.
Yea
,
and
he
also
saw
that
their
hearts
were
lifted
up
unto
great
boasting
,
in
their
pride
...
And
he
lifted
up
his
voice
to
heaven
,
and
cried
,
saying
:
O
how
long
,
O
Lord
,
wilt
thou
suffer
that
thy
.
servants
shall
.
dwell
here
below
in
the
flesh
,
to

gross
wickedness

Behold

O

they

,
and
yet
their

are

swallowed

in

pride
.
Behold
,
O
God
,
they
ery
unto
thee
with
their
mouths
,
while
they
are
puffed
up
,
even

with
the

Behold

and

their

of
gold
,
and
.
all
their
precious
things
which
they
are
ornamented
with
;
and
behold
,
their
hearts
.
are
set
upon
them
,
and
yet
they
cry
unto
thee
.
and
say
,
we
thank
thee
,
O
God
,
for

say

that

Now
.
it
came'to
pass
,
that
when
Alma
had
said
these
words
,
that
he
.
clapped
his
.
hands
upon
all
them
who
were
with
him
.
~And
:
behold
;
as
he
clapped
his
hands
upon
them
,
they
.
were
filled
with
the
holy
Spirit
..
And
after
that
,
they
.
did
:
separate
themselves
.
one
from
another
;
taking
9
thought
for
.
themselves
what
they
should
.
eat
,
or
what
they
should
drink
,
or
what
they
should
put
on
...
And
.
the
Lord
:
provided
for
them
that
they
should
hunger
not
,
neither
should
they
thirst
;
yea
,
and
he
also
gave
them
strength
,
that
they
.
should
suffer
no
manner
of
afilictions
,
save
it
-
were
swallowed
up
in
the
joy
of
Christ
.
Now
this
was
according
to
ro
prayer
of
Alma
;
and
this
because
he
prayed
in
aith
.
:
;
And
itcame
.
to
pass
that
they
.
did
go
forth
,
and
began
to
.
preach
the
word
of
God
unto
the
people
,
entering
into
their
synagogues
,
and
into
their
houses
;
yea
,
and
.
eyen
.
they
did
preach
the
word
in
their
streets
..
And
it
came
to
:
pass
that
after
much
laboramong
them
,
they
.
began
to
haye
:
success
among
.
the
poor
.
class
,
of
people
;
for
,
behold
,
they
were
cast
.
out
of
.
the
.
synagogues
;.
because
of
.
the
.
coarseness
of
their
:-
apparel
;
therefore
.
they
were
:
not
permitted
to
enter
into
their
synagogues
.
to
worship
.
God
,
being
esteemed
.
as
filthiness
;
therefore
.
they
were
poor
;
yea
,
they
.
were
:
esteemed
:
by
:
their
brethren
as
dross
;
therefore
-
they
were
poor
.
as
:
to
things
of
the
world
;
and
also
;
they
.
were

Now
as
Alma
-
was
..
teaching
and
.
speaking
unto
,
the
people
upon
:
the
hill
Onidah
,,
there
came
ajgreat
:
muliiude
,
unto
:
him
,
who
were
those
.
of
whom
we
have
[File:330]
been
speaking
,
of
whom
were
poor
in
.
heart
,
because
of
their
poverty'
.
as
to
the
.
things
of
.
the'world
:
~And
they
came
unto
Alma
;
and
the
.
one
who
was
the
most
foremost
.
among
them
,
said'
unto
him
,
behold
,
what
shall
these
my
brethren
do
,
for
they
are
despised
.
of
all
men
,
beeause
of
their
poverty
;
-
yea
,.
and
more
especially
by
our
priests
;
for
they
have
cast
us
out
of
our
synagogues
,
which
we
have
labored
abundantly
to
build
,
with
our
own
hands
;
and
they
have
-
cast
us
out
because
of
our
exceeding'
poverty
,
and
-
we
have
no
place
to
worship
our
God
;
and
behold
,
what
shall
we
do
?
And
now
when
Alma
heard
this
,
he
turned
him
about
,
his
face
immediately
towards
him
,
and
he
beheld
,
with
.
greatjoy
;
for
he
beheld
that
their
afflietions
had
truly
humbled
them
,
and
.
that
they
were
in
a
preparation
to
hear
the
word
;
theretore
he
did
sa
no
more
to
-
the
other
multitude
,
but
he
:
stretched
forth
his
hand
,
and
:
cried
unto
those
whom
he
beheld
,
who
were
truly
penitent
,
and
said
untothem
,
I
behold
that
e
are
lowly
in
heart
;
anduf
so
,
blessed
are
ye
.
Behold
,
thy
brother
hath
said
,
what
shall
we
do
?
for
we
are
cast
out
of
jour
synagogues
,
that
we
cannot
worship
our
God
..
Behold
I
say
unto
you
,
do
ye
suppose
that
ye
cannot
worship
God
,
save
it
be
in
your
synagogues
only
?
And
moreover
,
I
would
ask
,
do
ye
suppose
that
-
ye
must
not
worship
God
-
only
once
ina
week
?
I
-
say
unto
you
,
it
is
well
that
ye
are
cast
out
of
your
synagogues
,
that
ye
may
be
humble
,
and
that
ye
may
learn
wisdom
;
for
it
.
is
necessary
that
ye
should
learn
wisdom
;
for
it
is
because
that
ye
are
cast
out
,
that
ye
are
despised
of
your
brethren
,
because
of
our
exceeding
poverty
,
that
ye
are
brought
to
-
a
lowfincas
of
heart
;
for
ye
are
necessarily
brought
to
be
humble
.
And
now
because
ye
are
compelled
to
be
humble
,
blessed
are
ye
;
for
.
a
man
sometimes
,
if
hes
compelled
to
be
:
humble
,
seeketh
repentance
;.
and
now
surely
,
whosoever
repenteth
,
shall
find
mercy
;
and
he
that
findeth
mercy
,
and
enduretii
to
the
end
,
the
same
shall
be
-
saved
.
And
now
-
asI
said
unto
you
,
that
because
ye
were
compelled
to
be
humble
,
-
ye
-
were
blessed
,
do
ye
not
suppose
that
they
are
more
blessed
who
traly
humble
themselves
because
of
the
word
?
Yea
,
he
thattraly
humbleth
himself
,
and
repenteth
of
:
bis
sins
,
and
endureth
to
the
end
the
same
shall
be
blessed
;
yea
,
much
more
:
blessed
than
they
:
who
are
:
compelledto
be
humble}
:
because
:
of
their
exceeding
pover
ty}
:
therefore
blessed
-
are
they
who'
humble
themselves
[File:331]
without
being
compelled
to
be
humble
;
or
rather
;
in
other
:
words
,
blessed
is
he
that
believeth
in
the
word
of
God
;
and
is
baptized
without
stubborness
of
heart
;
yea
;
without
being
brought
to
know
the
word
,
or
even
compelled
to
know
,
before
they
will
believe
.
Yea
,
there
are
many
-
who
do
say
,
if
thou
wilt
show
unto
us
asign
from
-
heaven
,
then
we
shall
know
of
a
surety
;
then
we
shall
believe
.
Now
[
ask
,
is
this
-
faith
?
Behold
;
I'say
unto
you
,
nay
;
for
if
aman
knoweth
a
thing
,
he
hath
no
cause
to
believe
,
for
he
knoweth
it
.
And
now
,
how
much
more
cursed
is
he
that
knoweth
the
will
-
of
God
and
doeth
it
not
,
than
he
that
only
believeth
,
or
only
hath
cause
to
believe
,
and
falleth
imto
transgression
?
.
Now
of
this
thing
,
ye'must
judge
.
Behold
,
T
say
unto
you
,
that
it
is
om
the
one
hand
,
even
as
itis
on
the
other
;
and
it
shall
be
unto
every
man
according
to
his
work
,
And
now
ag
I
-
said
concerning
faith
:
Faith
,
is
not
to
-
have
a
perfect
knowledge
of
things
;
therefore
if
ye
have
faith
,
ye
hope
for
things
which
are
not
seen
,
which
are
true
.
And
now
,
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
:
andI
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
God
is
merciful
unto
all
who
believe
on
his
name
;
therefore
he
desireth
,
in
the
first
place
,
that
ye
should
believe
,
yea
,
even
on
his
word
.
And
now
,:
he
imparteth
his
word
by
angels
,
unto
men
;
yea
,
not
only
men
,
but
women
also
.
Now
this
is
not
all
:
little
children
do
have
words
given
unto
:
them
thany
times
,
which
confound
the
wiseand
theilearned
:
~
-
ee
And
now
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
as
ye
have
desired
toknow
of
me
what
ye
shall
do
because
ye
areafflicted
and
cast
out
:
now
I
do
not
desire
that
ye
should
Suppose
that
I
mean
to
judge
you
only
according
to
that
which
ig
true
;
for
I
do
not
;
mean
that
ye
all
of
you
have
been
compelled
to
humble
yourselves
;
for
I
verily
believe
that
there
are
some
among
you
who
would
-
humble
themselves
,
let
them
be
in
:
whatsoever
circumstances
they
might
.
'
Now
as
I
said
concerning
faith
.
that
it
was
not
a
perfect
.
knowledge
,
even
soit
is
:
with
my
words
.
Ye
cannot
know
of
their
surety
at
first
,
unto
perfection
,
any
.
more
than
faith
-
is
a
perfect
knowledge
:
'
But
behold
,
if
ye
will
awake
and
.
arouse
your
faculties
,
even
to
an
experiment
upon
my
words
,
and
exercise
a
particle
of
faith
;
yea
,
even
ifye
can'no
more'than
desire
to'
believe
,
lev
thig'desire
work
.
in
you
,
even
until
ye
believe'ina
tanner
that'
ye'can
give
place
fora
portion
of
my'
words
.
Now
we
will
[File:332]
compare
the
word'unto
a
.
seed
.
Now
.
if
ye
give
place
,
that
a
seed
may
be
planted
in
your
heart
,
behold
,
if
it
be
a
4rue
seed
,
or
a
good
.
seed
,
if
.
ye
do
not
cast
it
out
by
your
-
unbelief
,
that
ye
will
resist
the
spirit
.
of
the
Lord
,
behold
,
it
will
begin
to
swell
within
your
breasts
;
and
when
you
feel
these
swelling
motions
,
ye
will
begin
to
say
.
within
yourselves
,
if
must
.
needs
be
that
this
is
a
-
good
seed
,
or
that
the
word
is
.
good
,
for
it
beginneth
to
enlarge
my
soul
;
yea
,
it
beginneth
to
enlighten
my
understanding
;
yea
,
and
it
beginneth
to
be
delicious
tome
.
Now
behold
,
would
not
this
increase
your
faith
?.
I
say
unto
you
,
yea
;
nevertheless
it
hath
not
grown
up
to
a
perfect
knowledge
.
But
behold
,
as
the
seed
.
swelleth
,
and
sprouteth
,
and
beginneth
to
grow
,
then
ye
must
needs
say
,
that
the
seed
is
good
;
for
behold
it
swelleth
,
and
sprouteth
,
and
beginneth
to
grow
.
And
now
behold
,
are
ye
sure
that
this
is
a
good
seeu
?
.
I
say
unto
you
,
yea
;.
for
every
,
seed
bringeth
forth
unto
its
own
likeness
;
therefore
,
if'a
seed
groweth
,
it
is
good
;
but
if
,
it
.
groweth
not
,
behold
,
it
is
not
good
;
therefore
itis
cast
away
.
And
now
,
behold
,
because
ye
have
tried
the
experiment
,
and
,
planted
the
seed
,.
and
it
swelleth
,
and
sprouteth
,.
and
beginneth
to
grow
,
ye
must
needs
know
that
the
setd
is
-
good
..
And
now
behold
,
,
is
your
knowledge
perfect
?
_
Yea
,
your
knowledge
is
perfect
in
that
thing
,
and
your
faith
is
dormant
;
and
this
because
you
know
;
for
ye
know
that
:
the
word
hath
swelled
your
souls
,
and
ye
also
know
that
it
hath
sprouted
..
up
,.
that
your
understanding
doth
begin
to
be
enlightened
,
and
.
your
mind
doth
begin
to
expand
...
O
then
,:
is
not
this
real
?
I
.
say
unto
.
you
,
-
yea
;.
because
it
is
light
;.
and
.
whatsoever
is
light
,-
is
good
,
because
it
is
discernible
;
.
therefore
ye
must
know
that
.
itis
good
.
And
now
-
behold
,
after
ye
have
tasted
.
this
light
,
.
is
your
.
knowledge
:
perfect
!.
Behold
,
Tsay
,
unto
-
you
,
nay
:
neither
must
ye
lay
aside
your
faith
,
for
ye
.
have
only
exercised
.
your
faith
to
plant
the
.
seed
,
that
ye
:
might
try
.
the
experiment
,
to
snow
if
the
seed
.
was
good
.
.
And
behold
,
as
the
tree
beginneth
to
.
grow
,,
ye
-
will
say
,
,
let
us
nourish
iv
with
great
care
,
that
.
if
,
may
.
get
root
,
that
.
it
may
,
grow
up
and
bring
forth
fruit
unto
,
us
.
And
now
behold
,
if
ye
nourish
it
with
..
much
.
care
,
it
,
will
.
get
:
root
,
and
grow
up
,
and
bring
,
forth
fruit
.,.
But
if
ye
neglect
the
.
tree
,
and
,
take
no
thought
:
for
its
nourishment
,
behold
,
it
will
not
.
get
any
.
root
;,
and
.
when
the
.
heat
of
the
sun
cometh
and
scorcheth
it
,
because
it
hath
no
-
root
,
tt
[File:333]
withetsaway
,
and
ye'
pluck
it
up
-
and
cast
it
out
..
Now
this
is
not
because
the
seed
was
not
good
:
neither
is
it
because
the
fruit
thereof
would
not
be
desirable
.
But
it
is
because
your
ground
is
barren
,
and
ye
:
will
not
nourish
the
:
tree
;
therefore
ye
cannot
have
the
fruit
thereof
.::
And
thus
if
ye
will
notnourish
the
word
,
looking
forward
with
an
eye
of
faith
to
the
fruit
thereof
,
ye
can
never
pluck
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
life'
.
But
if
ye
will
nourish
the
word
,
yea
,
nourish
the
tree
as
-
it
beginneth
to
grow
,
by
your
faith
with
great
diligence
,
and
with
patience
,
looking
forward
to
the
fruit
thereof
,
it
-
shall'take
root
;
and
behold
,
it
shall
be
a
tree
-
springing
up
unto
everlasting
life
;
and
because
of
your
diligence
,
and
your
faith
,
and
your
patience
:
with
the
.
word
,
in
nourishing
-
it
,
that
it
:
may
take
root
in
you
,
behold
,
by
and
by
,
ye
shall
plack
the
fruit
thereof
,
which
is
most
precious
,
which
is
sweet
above
all
:
that
is'sweet
,
and
-
which
is
white
above
all
that
is
white
;
yea
,
and
pure
above
all
thatis
pure
;
and
ye
:
shall
feast
upon
this
fruit
,
even
until
ye
are
filled
,
that
ye
hunger
:
not
,
neither
shall
ye
thirst
.
Then
my
breth
ren
ye
shall
reap
the
rewards
of
your
faith
,
and
your
diligence
,
and
patience
,
and
long
suffering
,
waiting
for
the
tree
to
bring
forth
fruit
unto'
you
.
Now
after
Alma
had
spoken
these
words
,
they
sent
forth
unto
.
him
desiring
to
knew
whether
they
should
believe
in
one
God
,
that
they
might
obtain'
this
fruit
of
which
he
had
spoken
,
or
how
they
should
plant
the
seed
,
or
the
word
,
of
which
he
had
spoken
,
which
he
said
:
must
be
planted
in
their
hearts
;
or
in
what
manner
they
should
begin
to
exercise
their
faith
?)
And
Alma
said
.
unto
them
,
behold
ye
-
have
said
that~
ye
.
could
not
worship
your
God
,
because
ye
are
cast
out
of
your
synagogues
.
But
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
if
ye
suppose
that
ye
cannot
worship
God
,
ye
do
greatly
err
,
'and
ye
ought
-
to
search
the
scriptures
;
if
yesup

pose
that
they
have
tauglit
-
you
this
,
ye
do
notunder
-,
stand
them
.
Doye
remember
to
have
read
what
Ze
-
'
.
nos
,
the
prophet
of
old
,
has
said
concerning
prayer
or
:
worship
?
for
he
:
said
;
thou
art
merciful
:
O
God
,
for
thou
.
hast
heard
my
prayer
,
even
when
I
was
in
the
:
wilderness
;
yea
;
thou
wast
merciful
when
I
prayed
concerning
those
who
were'
mine
enemies
,
and
thou'
didst
turn
then
to
me
;
yea
;
O
.
God
,
and
thou
.
wast
merciful
unto
me
when
did
cry
unto
thee
in
my
field
;
when
I
didcry
unto
thee
in
iny
,
Braye
and
thoy
didstÂ®
.
hear
me
.
And
again
,
O
God
,
when
J
did'turn
to
my
\
[File:334]
house
thou
didst
.
hear
me
many
prayer
.
And
when
i
did
turn
unto
my
closet
,.
O
:
Lord
,
and
prayed
unto
thee
;
thou
didst
.
hear
,
me
;
yea
,
thou
art
:
merciful
unto
thy
children
.
when
they
.
cry
unto
thee
:
to
be
heard
of
thee
,
and
not
of
men
,
and
thou
wilt
hear
them
;
yea
,
O
.
God
thou
hast
.
been
merciful
unto
me
and
heard
my
eries
in
the
midst
of
thy
congregations
;
yea
,
and
thou
hast
also
heard
me
when
have
:
been
cast
out
,
and
have
been
despised'
by
mine
enemies
;
yea
,
thou
didst
hear
my
cries
,
and
wast
-
angry
.
with
mine
enemies
,
and
thou
didst
visit
them
in
thine
anger
,
with
speedy
destruction
;
and
thou
didst
hear
.
me
because
of
mine
afflictions
.
and
my
sincerity
;
and
;
it
.
is
because
of
thy
Son
that
thou
.
hast
been
thus
merciful
unte
me
;
therefore
I
will
cry
unto
.
thee
in
all
mine
afflictions
;,
for
in
thee
.
is
my
.
joy
;
for
thou
hast
turned
thy
.
judgments
away
from
me
,
because
of
thy
Son
.
And
now
Alma
said
unto
.
them
,
do
ye
believe
those
scriptures
which
have
been
written
by
them
of
old
?.
Behold
,
if
ye
do
,
ye
-
must
:
believe
what
)
Zenos
said
;.
for
behold
,
he
said
,
thou
hast
turned
away
thy
,
judgments
,
because
.
of
.
thy
Son
.
Now
behold
,
my
brethren
,
I
-
would
ask
,-
if
.
ye
have
read
the
scriptures
?..
If
.
ye
have
,
how
can
ye
disbelieve
on
the
Son
of
God
?.
For
it
is
not
.
written
.
that
,
Zenos'
alone
spake
.
of
these
things
,
but
-
Zenock
also
spake
of
these
things
;
for
behold
,
he
said
,
thou
art
-
angry
,
O
Lord
,
with
this
peo
-
ple
,
because
they
will
not
understand
of
thy
mercies
which
thou
hast
bestowed
upon
-
them
,
because
of
thy
Son
.
Andnovw
.
my
brethren
,
ye
see
that
a
second
prophet
of
old
has
testified
of
the
Son
of
God
;
and
because
the
pecple
would
not
understand
his
words
,
they
stoned
him
todeath
..
Butbehold
,
this
is
not
all
;
these
are
not
:
the
only
ones
who
have
spoken
concerning
the
Son
of
God
.
Behold
,
he
was
spoken
of
by
Moses
:
yea
,.
and
behold
,..
a
type
was
raised
:
up
in
.
the
wilderness
,
that
whosoever
,
would
look
upon
it
might
live
.
And
many
did
lookand
live
.
But
few
understood
the
meaning
of
those
things
,
and
this
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
...
But
there
were
many
who
were
so
hardened
that
they
would
not
look
;
therefore
they
perished
..
Now
the
reason
they
.
would
.
not
.-
look
,
is
because
they
did
not
believe
that
.
it
..
would
heal
them
.
O
my
brethren
,
if
ye
.
could
be
healed
by
merely
casting
.
ebout
,
your
.
eyes
,.
that
ye
,
might
be
:
healed
,
would
yenat
behold
quickly
,
-
or
would
ye
rather
harden
your
.
arta
in
unbelief
,.
and
~be
.
slothful
,
that
:
ye
would
not'
[File:335]
cast
about
your
eyes
,
thatye
might
perish
?
If
so
,
wo
shallcome
upon
you
;
but
-
if
notso
,
then
cast
about
your
eyes
and
begin
to
believe
in
the
Son
of
God
,
that
he
will
come
to
redeem
his'
people
,
and_
that
he
shall
suffer
and
die
to
atone
for
their
sins
;
and
that
he
shall
rise
again
from
the
dead
,
which
shall
bring
to
pass
the
:
resurrection
,
that
all
men
shall
stand
before
him
,
to
be
judged
,
at
the
last
and
judgment
day
,
according
to
.
their
works
.
And
now
my
brethren
,
desire
that
ye
shal
!
plant
this
word
in
your
hearts
,
and
as
it
beginneth
tovswell
,
even
so
nourish
it
by
your
faith
.
And
behold
;
it
will
become
a
tree
,
springing
up
in
you
unto
everlasting
life
.
And
then
may
God
grant
unto
you
that
your
burdens
may
be
light
,
through
the
joy
of
his
Son
.
And
even
a
)
]
this
can
ye
do
,
if
ye
will
..
_
Amen
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Alma
had
spoken
these
words
unto
them
,
he
sat
down
upon
the
ground
,
and
Amulek
arose
and
began
to
teach
them
,
saying
,
my
brethren
,
I
think
that
itis
impossible
that
ye
should
be
ignorant
of
the
things
which
have
been
spoken
concerning
the
coming
of
Christ
,
who
is
taught
by
us
to
be
the
Son
of
God
;
yea
,
I
know
that
these
things
were
taught
unto
you
,
bountifully
,
before
your
dissension
from
among
us
.
And
as
ye
have
desired
of
my
beloved
brother
,
that
he
should
make
known
unto
you
what
ye
should
do
,
because
of
your
afflictions
;
and
he
hath
spoken
somewhat
unto
you
to
prepare
your
minds
;
yea
,
and
he
hath
exhorted
you
unto
faith
,
and
to
patience
;
yea
,
even
that
ye
would
have
so
much
faith
as
even
to
plant
the
word
in
your
hearts
,
that
ye
may
try
the
experiment
of
its
goodness
;
and
we
have
beheld
that
the
great
question
which
is
in
your
minds
;
is
whether
the
word
be
in
the
Son
of
God
,
or
whether
there
shall
be
no
Christ
.
And
ye
also
beheld
that
my
brother
has
proven
unto
you
,
in
many
instances
,
that
the
word
isin
Christ
,
unto
salvation
.
My
brother
has
called
upon
the
words
of
Zenos
,
that
redemption
cometh
through
the
Son
of
God
,
and
also
upon
the
words
of
Zenock
;
and
also
he
-
has
appealed
unto
Mo
-
.
ses
,
to
prove
that
these
things
are
true
.
And
now
-
behold
,
I
will
testify
unto
:
you
of
myself
,
that
these
.
things
are
true
.
Behold
,
i
say
unto
you
;
that
I
-
do
know
that
Christ
shall
come
among
the
children
of
men
,
to
take
upon
him
the
transgressions
of
his
people
,
and
that
he
shall
atone
for
the
sins
of
the
world
;
forthe
Lord
God
has
spoken
it
;
for
it
is
expedient
[File:336]
that
an
atonement
should
-
be
made
;
for
according
to
the
great
plan
of
the
-
eternal
God
,
there
.
must
be
an
atonement
made
,
or
else
all
mankind
must
unavoidably
perish
;
yea
,
all
are
hardened
;
yea
,
all
are
failen
,
and
are
lost
,
and
must
perish
except
.
it
be
through
the
atonement
which
it
is
expedient
should
be
made
;
for
it
is
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
great
and
last
sacrifice
;
yea
,
nota
sacrifice
of
man
,
neither
of
beast
,
neither
of
any
mannervof
fowl
;
for
itshall
not
be
a
human
sacrifice
;
but
it
must
be
an
infinite
and
eternal
sacrifice
.
Now
there
is
not
.
any
man
that
can
saerifice
his
own
blood
,
which
will
atone
for
the
sins
of
another
.
Now
ifa
manmurdereth
,
behold
,
will
our
law
,
which
is
just
,
take
the
life
of
his
brother
?
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
.
But
the
law
requireth
the
life
of
him
who
hath
murdered
;
therefore
there
can
be
nothing
,
which
is
short
of
an
infinite
atonement
,
which
will
suffice
for
the
sins
of
the
world
;
therefore
it
is
expedient
that
there
should
be
a
great
and
last
sacrifice
;
and
then
shall
there
be
,
or
itis
expedient
there
should
be
,
a
stop
to
the
shedding
of
blood
;
then
shall
the
law
of
Moses
be
fulfilled
;
yea
,
it
shall
all
be
fulfilled
;
every
jotand
tittle
,
and
none
shall
have
passed
away
.
And
behold
,
thisis
the
whole
meaning
of
the
law
;
every
whit
pointing
to
that
great
and
last
sacrifice
;
and
that
great
and
last
sacfiec
will
be
the
Son
of
God
;
yea
,
infinite
and
eternal
;
and
thus
he
shall
bring
salvation
to
all
those
who
shall
believe
on
his
name
;
this
being
the
intent
of
this
last
sacrifice
,
to
bring
about
the
bowels
of
mercy
,
which
overpowereth
justice
and
bringeth
about
means
unto
men
that
they
may
have
faith
unto
repentance
.
And
thus
merey
can
satisfy
the
demands
of
justice
,
and
encircles
them
in
the
arms
of
safety
,
while
he
that
exercises
no
faith
unto
repentance
,
is
exposed
to
the
whole
law
of
the
demands
of
justice
;
therefore
,
only
unto
him
that
has
faith
unto
repentance
,
is
.
brought
about
the
great
and
eternal
plan
of
redemption
.
Therefore
may
God
grant
unto
.
you
,
my
brethren
,
that
ye
may
begin
to
exerci
your
faith
unto
repentance
,
that
ye
begin
to
call
upon
his
holy
name
,
that
he
would
have
mercy
upon
you
yea
,
cry
unto
him
for
mercy
;
for
he
is
mighty
to
save
:
yea
,
humble
yourselves
,
and
continue
in
prayer
un
him
;
ery
unto
him
when
ye
are
in
your
fields
;
yea
:
overall
your
flocks
;
ery
unto
him
in
your
houses
,
ye
:
overall
your
household
,
both
morning
,
mid
-
day
,
and
evening
;
.
yea
,.
cry
unto
him
-
against
the
power
of
you
!
enemies
;
yea
,
cry
,
unto
him
against
the
devil
,
whos
[File:337]
an
enemy
.
to
all
righteousness
.
Cry
unto
him
over
the
crops
of
your
fields
,
that
-
ye
may
prosper
in
them
;
ery
over
.
the
flocks
of
your
fields
,
that
they
may
increase
.
But
.
this
is
not
all
:
ye
must
pour
out
your
souls
in
your
closets
,
and
your
secret
places
,
and
in
your
wilderness
;
yea
,
and
when
you
do
not
cry
unto
the
Lord
,
let
your
.
hearts
be
fall
,
drawn
out
in
prayer
unto
him
cantinually
for
your
welfare
,
and
also
for
the
welfare
of
those
who
are
around
you
.
Aad
now
behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
T
say
unto
you
,
do
not
supdese
that
this
ts
all
;
for
atter
ye
have
done
ali
these
things
,
if
ye
turn
away
the
needy
,
and
the
naked
,
and
visit
not
the
sick
and
afflicted
,
and
impart
of
your
substance
,
if
ye
have
,
to
those
who
stand
in
need
;
[
say
unto
you
,
if
ye
donot
any
of
these
things
,
behold
,
your
prayer
is
vain
,
and
availeth
you
nothing
,
and
ye
are
as
hypocrites
who
do
deny
the
faith
;
therefore
,
if
ye
do
not
remember
to
ba
charitable
,
ye
are
as
dross
,
which
the
refiners
do
cast
out
,
(
it
being
of
no
worth
,)
and
is
trodden
under
foot
of
men
.
And
now
,
my
brethren
,
I
would
that
after
ye
have
reesived
so
many
witnesses
,
seeing
that
the
holy
scriptures
testify
of
these
things
,
come
forth
and
bring
fruit
unto
repentance
;
yea
,
I
would
that
ye
would
come
forth
and
harden
not
your
hearts
any
longer
;
for
behold
,
now
is
the
time
,
and
the
day
of
your
salvation
;
aml
therefore
,
if
ye
will
repent
and
harden
not
your
hearts
,
iminediately
shall
the
great
plan
of
redemption
bebrought
aboutunto
you
.
Tor
behold
,
this
life
is
the
time
for
men
to
prepare
to
meet
God
;
yea
,
behold
,
the
day
of
this
life
is
the
day
for
men
to
perform
their
labors
.
And
now
as
I
said
-
unte
you
before
,
as
ye
have
had
so
many
witnesses
,
'
therefore
1
beseech
of
you
,
that
ye
do
not
procrastinate
the
day
of
your
repentance
.
until
the
end
;
for
afier
this
day
of
life
,
which
.
is
given
us
to
prepare
for
eternity
,
behold
,
if
we
.
do
not
improve
our
time
while
in
this
life
,
then
cometh
the
night
of
darknesss
,
wherein
there
can
be
no
labor
performed
.
Ye
cannot
say
,
when
ye
are
brought
to
that
awfuberisis
,
that
L
will
repent
,
that
I
will
return
to
wy
God
.
:
Nay
,
ye
eannot
say
.
this
;
for
that
same
spirit
which
doth
possess
:
your
bodies
at
the
time
that
ye
go
:
out
of
this
life
,
thatsame
spirit
:
will
have
power
topossess
your
body
in
:
that
eternal
world
.
For
behold
,
if
ye
have
procrastinated
the
day
:
of
your
repentance
,
even
until
death
,
behold
,
ye
have
become
ted
:
to
:
the
spirit
of
the
devil
,
and
:
he
doth
seal
yowhil
;
[File:338]
therefore
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
hath
withdrawn
from
you
,
and
hath
no
place
in
you
,
and
the
devil
hath
all
power
over
you
;
and
this
is
the
final
state
of
the
wicked
.
And
this
I
know
,
because
the
Lord
hath'said
,
he
dwelleth
not
in
unholy
temples
,
but
in
the
hearts
of
the
righteous
doth
hedwell
;
yea
,
and
hehas
also
said
,
that
the
righteous
shall
sit
down
in
his
kingdom
,
to
go
no
more
out
;
but
their
garments
should
be
made
white
,
through
the
blood
of
the
Lamb
.
And
now
my
beloved
brethren
,
1
desire
that
ye
should
remember
these
things
,
and
that
ye
should
work
out
your
salvation
with
fear
before
God
,
and
that
ye
should
no
more
deny
the
coming
of
Christ
;
that
ye
contend
no
more
against
the
Holy
Ghost
,
but
that
ye
receive
it
,
and
take
upon
you
the
name
of
Christ
;
that
ye
humble
yourselves
even
to
the
dust
,
and
worship
God
in
whatsoever
place
ye
,
may
be
in
,
in
spirit
and
in
truth
;
and
that
ye
live
in
thanksgiving
daily
,
for
the
many
mercies
and
blessings
which
he
doth
bestow
upon
you
;
yea
,
and
I
also
exhort
you
,
my
brethren
,
that
ye
be
watchful
unto
prayer
continually
,
that
ye
may
not
be
led
away
by
the
temptation
of
the
devil
,
that
he
may
not
overpower
you
,
that
ye
may
not
become
his
subjects
at
the
last
day
:
for
behold
,
he
rewardeth
you
no
good
thing
.
And
now
.
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
would
exhort
you
to
have
patience
,
and
that
ye
bear
with
all
manner
of
afflictions
;
that
ye
do
not
revile
against
those
who
-
do
cast
you
out
because
of
your
exceeding
poverty
,
lest
ye
become
sinners
like
unto
them
;
but
that
ye
have
patience
,
and
bear
with
those
afflictions
,
with
a
firm
hope
that
ye
shall
one
day
rest
from
all
your
afflictions
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Amulek
had
made
an
end
of
these
words
,
they
withdrew
themselves
from
the
multitude
,
and
came
over
into
the
land
of
Jershon
;
yea
,
and
the
rest
of
the
brethren
,
after
they
had
preached
the
word
unto
the
Zoramites
,
also
came
over
into
the
land
of
Jershon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
more
popular
part
of
the
Zoramites
had
consulted
together
concerning
the
words
which
had
been
preached
unto
them
,
they
were
angry
because
of
the
svord
,
for
it
-
did
destroy
their
craft
;
therefore
they
would
not
hearken
unto
the
words
.
And
they
sent
and
gathered
together
through
out'
all
the
:
land
,
all
.
the
people
;
and
consulted
with
them
-
eoncerning
the
words
:
which
:
had
been
spoken
.
Now
:
their
:
rulers
:
and
their
priests
;
andi
their
teachers
[File:339]
did
not
let
the
people
know
concerning
.
their
desires
;
therefore
they
found
out
privily
the
minds
of
all
the
people
.
And
if
came
to
pass
that
after
they
had
found
out
the
minds
of
all
the
people
,
those
who
were
in
favor
of
the
words
which
had
been
spoken
by
Alma
and
his
brethren
,
were
cast
out
of
the
land
;
and
they
were
many
;
and
they
came
over
also
into
the
land
of
Jershon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Alma
and
his
brethren
did
minister
unto
them
.
Now
the
people
of
the
Zorarnites
were
angry
with
the
people
of
Ammon
who
were
in
Jershon
,
and
the
chief
ruler
of
the
Zoramites
being
a
very
wicked
man
,
sent
over
unto
the
people
of
Ammon
desiring
them
that
they
should
cast
out
of
their
land
all
those
Who
came
over
from
them
into
their
land
..
And
he
breathed
out
many
threatnings
against
them
,
And
now
the
people
of
Ammon
did
not
fear
their
words
,
therefore
they
did
not
cast
them
out
,
but
they
did
receive
all
the
poor
-
of
the
Zoramites
that
came
over
unto
them
;
and
they
did
nourish
them
,
and
did
clothe
them
,
and
did
give
unto
them
lands
for
their
inheritance
;
and
they
did
administer
unto
them
according
to
their
wants
.
Now
this
did
stir
up
the
Zoramites
to
anger
against
the
people
of
Ammon
,
and
they
began
to
mix
with
the
Lamanites
,
and
to
stir
them
up
also
to
anger
against
them
:
and
thus
the
Zoramites
and
the
Lamanites
began
to
make
preparations
for
war
against
the
people
of
Ammon
,
and
also
against
the
Nephites
.
And
thus
ended
the
seventeenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
the
people
of
Ammon
departed
out
of
the
land
of
Jershon
,
and
came
over
into
the
land
of
Melek
,
and
gave
place
in
the
land
of
Jershon
for
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
,
that
they
might
contend
with
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
the
armics
of
the
Zoramites
;
and
thus
commenced
a
war
betwixt
the
Lamanites
and
the
Nephites
,
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
udges
;
and
an
account
shall
be
given
of
their
wars
ereafier
.
And
Alma
,
and
Ammon
,
and
their
brethten
,
and
also
the
two
sons
of
Alma
,
returned
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
after
having
been
instruments
in
the
hands
of
God
of
bringing
-
many
of
the
Zoramites
to
repentance
;
and
ag
many
as
were
brought
to
repata
were
driven
out
of
their
land
;
but
they
have
ds
for
their
inheritance
in
the
land
of
Jershon
,
and
tiey
have
taken
up
arms
to
defend
themselves
,
and
[File:340]
their
wives
,
and
children
,
and
their
lands
...
Now
Alma
,
being
grieved
:
for
the
iniquity
of
his
people
,
yea
for
the
wars
,
and
the
bloodsheds
,
and
the
contentions
which
were
among
them
;
andvhaving
been
to
-
declare
the
word
,
or
sent
to
declare
the
word
,
among
all
the
people
in
every
city
;
and
seeing
that
the
hearts
of
the
people
began
to
wax
hard
,
and
that
they
began
to
be
offended
because
of
the
strictness
of
the
word
,
his
heart
was
exceeding
sorrowful
;
therefore
,
he
caused
that
his
sons
should
be
gathered
together
,
that
he
might
give
unto
them
every
one
his
charge
,
separately
,
concern
.
ing
the
things
pertaining
unto
righteousness
.
And
we
have
an
account
of
his
commandments
,
which
he
gave
unto
them
according
to
his
own
record
.
CHAPTER
XVII
.
The
commandments
of
Alina
,
to
his
son
Helaman
.
My
son
,
give
ear
to
:
my
words
;
for
I
swear
unto
you
,
that
inasmuch
as
ye
shall
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
.
J]
would
that
ye
should
do
as
I
have
done
,
in
remembering
the
captivity
of
our
fathers
;
for
they
were
in
bondage
,
and
none'
could
deliver
them
,
except
-
it
was
the
God
of
Abraham
,
and
the
God
of
Isaac
,
and
the
God
of
Jacob
;
and
he
surely
did
deliver
them
in
their
afflictions
.
And
now
,
O
my
son
Helaman
,
behold
,
thou
art
in
thy
youth
,
and
therefore
I
beseech
of
thee
that
thou
wilt
hear
my
words
,
and
learn
of
me
;
for
1
do
know
that
whosoever
shall
put
their
trust
in
God
,
shall
.
be
supported
in
.
their
trials
,
and
their
troubles
,
and
their
af
dictions
,
and
shall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
;
andl
would
not
thet
ye
think
that
:
I
-
know
of
myself
,
not
of
the
temporal
,
but
of
the
spiritual
;
not
of
the
carnal
mind
,
but
of
God
,
Now
behold
Isay
unto
you
,
if
1
had
not
:
been
.
born
of
God
,
I
should
not
-
have
known
these
things
;
but'God
has
;
bythe
mouth
of
his
:
holy
angel
,
made
these
things
.
known
unto
me
,
not
of
any
worthiness
of
:
myself
,
for
T
-
went
about
with
the
sons
of
Mosiah
,
seeking
to
destroy
the
church
of
Ged
;
but
behold
,
God'sent
his
holy
,
angel
:
to
stop
us
by
the
waJAnd
behold
,
he
spakeunto
us
;
as
it
were'
the
voice
of
[File:341]
thunder
,
and
the
whole
.
earth
did
tremble
beneath
our
feet
,
and
we
all
.
fell
:
to
the
earth
,
for
the
fear
of
the
Lord
came
-
upon
us
...
But
behold
,
the
voice
said
unto
me
,
arise
.
And
IT
arose
and
stood
up
,
and
belield
the
angel
.
And
he
said
unto
me
,
if
thou
wilt
of
thyself
be
destsoyed
,
seek
no
more
to
destroy
the
church
of
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
fell
to
the
earth
:
and
it
was
for
the
space
of
three
days
and
three
nights
,
that
I
could
not
open
my
mouth
;
neither
had
I
the
use
of
my
limbs
.
And
the
angel
spake
more
things
unto
ine
,
Which
were
heard
by
my
brethren
,
bat
1
did
not
hear
them
;
for
when
I
heard
the
words
,
if
thou
wilt
be
destroyed
of
thyself
,
seek
no
more
to
destroy
the
church
of
God
,
I
was
struck
with
such
great
fear
and
amazement
,
lest
perhaps
[
should
be
destroyed
,
that
I
fall
to
the
earth
,
and
I
did
hear
no
more
;
but
J
was
racked
with
efernal
torment
,
for
my
soul
was
harrowedup
to
the
greatest
degree
,
and
racked
with
all
my
sins
.
Yea
,
I
did
remember
all
my
sins
and
iniquities
,
for
which
[
was
tormented
with
the
pains
of
hell
;
yea
,
I
saw
that
[
had
rebelled
against
my
God
,
and
that
J
had
not
kept
his
holy
commandments
;
yea
,
and
[
had
murdered
many
of
his
children
,
or
rather
led
them
away
unto
destruction
;
yea
,
and
in
fine
,
so
great
had
been
my
iniquities
,
that
the
very
thoughts
of
coming
into
the
presence
of
my
God
,
did
rack
my
soul
with
inexpressible
horror
.
O
,
thought
I
,
that
I
could
be
banished
and
become
extinct
both
soul
and
body
,
that
I
might
not
be
brought
to
staad
in
the
presence
of
my
God
,
to
be
judged
of
my
deeds
.
And
now
,
for
three
days
and
for
three
nights
was
I
racked
,
even
with
the
pains
of
a
damned
soul
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
J
was
thus
racked
with
torment
,
while
I
was
harrowed
up
by
the
memory
of
my
many
sins
,
behold
,
I
remembered
also
to
have
heard
my
father
prophesy
unto
the
people
,
conceriing
the
coming
of
one
Jesus
Christ
,
a
Sun
of
God
,
to
atone
for
the
sins
of
the
world
.
Now
as
my
mind
caught
hold
upon
this
thought
,
I
cried
within
my
heart
,
O
Jesus
,
thou
Son
.
of
God
,
have
mercy
on
me
,
who
art
in
the
gall
of
bitterness
,
and
art
encircled
about
by
the
everlasting
chains
of
death
.
And
now
.
behold
,
when
.
I
thought
this
,
I
could
remember
.
my
pains
no
more
;
yea
,
was
harrowed
up
by
the
memory
of
my
sins
no
more
.
And
O
,
what
joy
,
and
.
what
marvelous
light
I
did
behold
;
yea
,
my
soul
was
filled
.
[File:342]
with
joy
as
exceeding
as
was
my
pain
;
yea
,
I
say
unto
you
,
my
son
,
that
there
could
be
nothing
so
exquisite
and
so
bitter
,
as
was
my
pains
.
Yea
,
and
again
I
say
unto
you
,
my
son
,
that
on
the
other
hand
,
there
can
be
nothing
so
exquisite
and
.
sweet
as
was
my
joy
;
yea
,
me
thought
I
saw
even
as
our
father
Lehi
saw
,
God
sitting
upon
his
throne
,
surrounded
with
numberless
concourses
of
angels
,
in
the
attitude
of
singing
and
praising
their
God
;
yea
,
and
my
soul
did
Jong
to
be
there
.
But
behold
,
my
limbs
.
did
receive
their
strength
again
,
and
I
stood
upon
my
feet
,
and
did
manifest
unto
the
people
that
I
had
been
born
of
God
;
yea
,
and
from
that
time
,
even
until
now
,
I
have
labored
without
ceasing
,
that
might
bring
souls
unto
repentance
;
that
J
might
bring
them
to
taste
of
the
exceeding
joy
of
which
I
did
taste
;
that
they
might
also
be
born
of
God
,
and
be
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost
.
Yea
,
and
now
behold
,
O
my
son
,
the
Lord
doth
give
me
exceeding
great
joy
in
the
fruit
of
my
labors
;
for
because
of
the
word
which
he
has
imparted
unto
me
,
behold
,
many
have
been
born
of
God
,
and
have
tasted
as
I
have
tasted
,
and
have
seen
eye
to
eye
,
as
have
seen
;
therefore
they
do
know
of
.
these
things
of
which
I
have
spoken
,
as
I
do
know
;
and
the
knowledge
which
I
have
is
of
God
.
And
I
have
been
supported
under
trials
and
troubles
of
every
kind
,
yea
,
and
in
all
manner
of
afflictions
;
yea
,
God
has
delivered
me
from
prison
,
and
from
bonds
,
and
from
death
:
yea
,
and
I
do
put
my
trust
in
him
,
and
he
will
-
still
deliver
me
;
and
J
know
that
he
will
raise
me
up
at
the
last
day
,
to
dwell
with
him
in
glory
;
yea
,
and
I
will
praise
him
forever
,
for
he
has
brought
our
fathers
.
out
of
Egypt
,
and
he
has
swallowed
up
the
Eyptians
in
the
red
sea
;
and
he
led
them
by
his
pow
-
r
into
the
promised
land
;
yea
,
and
he
has
delivered
.
them
out
of
bondage
.
and
captivity
,
from
time
to
time
;
yea
,
and
he
has
also
brought
our
fathers
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
;
and
he
has
also
,
by
his
everlasting
power
,
delivered
them
out
.
of
bondage
and
captivity
,
from
time
to
time
,
even
down
to
the
present
day
;
and
I
have
always
.
retained
in
remembrance
their
captivity
;
yea
,
and
ye
also
ought
to
retain
in
remembrance
,
as
[
have
done
,
their
captivity
.
But
behold
,
my
son
,
this
is
not
all
:
for
ye
ought
-
to
.
know
,
as
Ido
know
;
that
inasmuch
as
ye
shail
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
ye
shall
pros
:
per
in
the
land
;:
and
ye
ought
to
.
know
,
also
,.
that
inasmueh
as
ye
will
not
,
keep
tne
commandments
of
God
,
[File:343]
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
his
presence
.
Now
this
is
according
to
his
word
,
And
now
my
son
Helaman
,
I
command
you
that
ye
take
the
records
which
have
been
entrusted
with
me
;
and
also
command
you
that
ye
keep
a
record
of
this
people
,
according
as
I
have
done
,
upon
the
plates
of
Nephi
,
and
keep
all
these
things
sacred
which
I
have
kept
,
even
as
1
have
kept
them
:
for
it
is
for
a
wise
purpose
that
they
are
kept
;
and
.
these
plates
of
brass
which
contain
these
engravings
,
which
have
the
records
of
the
holy
scriptures
upon
them
,
which
have
the
genealogy
of
our
forefathers
,
even
from
the
beginnig
.
And
behold
,
it
has
been
prephesied
by
our
fathers
,
that
they
should
be
kept
and
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
another
,
and
be
kept
and
preserved
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
until
they
should
go
forth
unto
every
nation
,
kindred
,
tongue
and
people
,
that
they
shall
know
of
the
mysteries
contained
thereon
.
And
now
behold
,
if
they
are
kept
,
they
must
retain
their
brightness
;
yea
,
and
they
will
retain
their
bnghtness
:
yea
,
and
also
shall
all
the
plates
which
do
contain
that
whichis
holy
writ
.
Now
ye
may
suppose
that
this
is
foolishness
in
me
;
but
behold
I
say
unto
you
,
that
by
small
and
simple
things
,
are
great
things
brought
to
pass
;
and
small
means
in
many
instances
,
doth
confound
the
wise
.
And
the
Lord
God
doth
work
by
means
to
bring
about
his
great
and
eternal
purposes
;
and
.
by
very
small
means
the
Lord
doth
confound
the
wise
,
and
bringeth
about
the
salvation
of
many
souls
.
And
now
,
it
has
hitherto
been
wisdom
in
God
,
that
these
things
should
be
preserved
:
for
behold
,
they
have
enlarged
the
memory
of
this
people
,
yea
,
and
convinced
many
of
the
error
of
their
ways
,
and
brought
them
to
the
knowledge
of
their
God
,
unto
the
salvation
of
their
souls
.
Yea
,
1
say
unto
you
,
were
it
not
for
these
things
that
these
records
do
contain
,
which
are
on
these
plates
,
Ammon
and
his
brethren
could
not
have
:
convinced
so
many
thousands
-
of
the
Lamanites
,
of
the
incorrect
tradition
.
of
their
:
fathers
;
yea
,
these
records
and
their
words
,
brought
them
unto
repentance
;
that
is
,
they
brought
them
to
the
knowledge
of
the
Lord
their
God
,
and
:
to
rejoice
in
Jesus
Christ
,
their
redeemer
.
And
:
who
.
knoweth
but
what
they
will
be
the
means
of
bringing
many
thousands
of
them
,
yea
,
and
also
many
thousands
.
ef
:
our
.
stiffnecked
brethren
,
the
Nephites
,
who
are
now
hardening
their
hearts
in
sin
:
and
-
iniquities
,
to
the
[File:344]
knowledge
of
their
Redeemer
?
-
Now
these

me
;
therefore
I
shall
forbear

And
it
may
suffice
,
if
I
only
say
,
they
are
preserved
for
a
wise
purpose
,
which
purpose
is
known
unto
God
:
for
he
doth
counsel
in
wisdom
over
all
his
works

and
his
paths
.
are
straight
,
and
his
course
is
one
eternal
round
.
O
remember
,
remember
,
my
son
Helaman
,
how
strict
are
the
commandments
of
God
.
And
he
said
,
if
ye
will
keep
my
commandments
,
ye
shall
prosper
in
the
land
;
but
if
ye
keep
not
his
commandments
,
ye
shall
be
cut
,
off
from
.
his
presence
.
And
now
remember
,
my
son
,
that
God
has
entrusted
you
with
these
things
,
which
are
sacred
,
which
he
has
.
kept
sacred
,
and
also
which
he
will
keep
and
preserve
for
a
wise
purpose
in
him
,
that
he
may
shew
forth
his
power
unto
future
generations
.
And
now
behold
,
I
tell
you
by
the
spirit
of
prophecy
,
that
if
ye
transgress
the
commandments
of
God
,
behold
,
these
things
which
are
sacred
,
shall
be
takeu
away
from
you
by
the
power
of
God
,
and
ye
shall
be
delivered
up
unto
satan
,
that
he
may
sift
you
as
chaff
before
the
wind
;
but
if
ye
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
do
with
these
things
which
are
-
sacred
,
according
to
that
which
the
Lord
doth
command
.
you
,
(
for
you
must
appeal
unto
the
Lord
for
all
things
whatsoever
ye
must
do
with
them
,)
beheld
,
no
power
of
earth
or
hell
can
take
them
from
you
,
for
God
is
powerful
to
the
fulfilling
of
all
his
.
words
;
for
he
will
fulfil
all
his
promises
which
he
shall
make
unto
you
,
for
he
has
fulfilled
his
promises
which
he
has
made
unto
our
fi
thers
.
For
he
promised
unto
them
.
that
he
would
reserve
these
things
for
a
wise
purpose
in
him
,
that
he
might
shew
forth
his
power
unto
future
gnerations
.
And
now
behold
,
one
purpose
hath
he
fulfilled
,
even
to
the
restoration
of
many
thousands
of
the
Lamanites
to
:
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
;
and
he
hath
shewn
forth
his
power
in
them
,
and
he
will
also
still
shew
forth
his
power
in
them
,
unto
future
generations
;
therefore
they
shall
be
preserved
;
therefore
I
command
you
,
myson
Helaman
,
that
ye
be
diligent
i
fulfilling
all
my
words
,
and
that
ye
be
diligent
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
God
,
as
they
are
written
.
And
now
,
I
will
.
speak
unto
.
you
concerning
.
those
twenty
-
four
plates
,
that
ye
keep
them
,
that
the

or

of
those

who

have

;
yea
,
all
their
murders
,
and
robbings
,
and
their
plunderings
,
and
all
.
their
wickedness
,
and
abominations
,
may
be
made
manifest
unto
this
people
;
yea
;
and
that
ye
preserve
these
directors
.
For
behold
,
the
Lord
saw
that
his
people
began
to
work
in
darkness
;
yea
,
work
secret
inurders
ant
abominations
;
therefore
the
Lord
said
,
if
they
did
not
repent
,
they
should
be
destroyed
from
oif
the
face
of
the
earth
.
And
the
Lord
said
,
1
will
prepare
unto
my
servant
Gazelem
,
a
stone
,
which
shall
shine
forth
in
darkness
unto
light
,
that
I
may
discover
unto
my
people
wio
serve
me
,
that
I
may
discover
unto
them
the
works
of
their
brethren
;
yea
,
the
:
r
secret
works
,
their
works
of
darkness
,
and
their
wickedness
and
abominations
,
And
now
my
son
,
these
directors
were
prepared
,
that
the
word
of
God
might
be
fulfilled
,
which
he
spake
,
saying
:
I
will
bring
forth
out
of
darxness
unto
Hight
,
all
their
seeret
works
and
their
abominations
:
and
except
they
repent
,
[
will
destroy
them
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
;
and
IL
will
bring
to
light
all
their
secrets
and
abominations
,
unto
every
nation
that
shail
here
:
afler
possess
the
land
.
And
now
my
sen
,
we
see
that
they
did
not
repent
:
therefore
they
have
been
destroyed
,
and
thus
far
the
word
of
God
has
been
fulfilled
;
yea
,
their
secret
abominations
have
been
brought
out
of
darkness
,
and
made
known
unto
us
.
And
now
my
son
,
I
command
you
that
ye
retain
all
their
oaths
,
and
their
covenants
,
and
their
agreements
in
their
secret
abominations
;
yea
,
and
all
their
signs
and
their
wonders
ye
shall
retain
from
this
people
,
that
they
know
them
not
,
lest
peradventure
they
should
fxil
into
darkness
also
,
and
be
destroyed
.
For
behold
,
there
is
a
curse
upon
aH
this
land
,
that
destruction
shall
come
upon
all
those
workers
of
darkness
,
according
to
.
the
.
pewer
of
Ged
,
when
they
are
fully
ripe
;
therefore
I
desire
that
this
people
:
might
not
be
destroyed
.
Therefore
-
ye
sha
!
l
keep
these
secret
plans
oftheir
oaths
and
them
covenants
from
this
people
,
and
only
their
wickedness
,
and
their
murders
;
and
their
abominations
,
'
shall
ye
make
known
unto
them
:
and
ye
shall
.
teach
them
-
to
abhor
such
wicked
:
.
ness
;
and
abominations
,
and
murders
;
and
-
we
shall
also
teach
them
,
that
these
people
were'
destroyed
on
account
-
of
their
wickedness
,
and
abominations
,
and
their
murders
:
For
behold
,
they
murdered'
all
the
prophets
ofthe
Lord
who
came
among
them
to
declare
unto'
them
concerning'
their
iniquities
;
'
and
the
[File:346]
blood
of
those
whom
they
murdered
,
did
ery
unto
the
Lord
their
God
,
for
vengeance
upon
those
who
were
their
murderers
;
and
thus
the
judgments
of
God
did
come
upon
these
workers
of
darkness
and
secret
combinations
;
yea
,
and
cursed
be
the
land
forever
and
ever
unto
those
workers
of
darkness
and
secret
combinations
,
even
unto
destruction
,
except
they
repent
before
they
are
fully
ripe
.
And
now
my
son
,
remember
the
words
which
I
have
spoken
unto
you
:
trust
not
these
secret
plans
unto
this
people
,
but
teach
them
an
-
everlasting
hatred
against
sin
and
iniquity
;
preach
unto
them
repentance
,
and
faith
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
;
teach
them
to
humble
themselves
,
and
to
be
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
;
teach
them
to
withstand
every
temptation
of
the
devil
,
with
their
faith
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
;
teach
them
to
never
be
weary
of
good
works
,
but
to
be
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
:
for
such
shall
find
rest
to
their
souls
.
O
remember
my
son
,
and
learn
wisdom
in
thy
youth
;
yea
,
Jearn
in
thy
youth
to
keep
the
commandments
of
God
;
yea
,
and
cry
unto
God
for
all
thy
support
;
yea
,
Jet
all
thy
doings
be
unto
the
Lord
,
and
whithersoever
thou
goest
,
let
it
be
in
the
Lord
:
ea
,
let
thy
thoughts
be
directed
unto
the
Lord
;
yea
,
et
the
affections
of
thy
heart
be
placed
upon
the
Lord
forever
;
counsel
.
the
Lord
in
all
thy
doings
,
and
he
will
direct
thee
for
good
;
yea
,
when
thou
lest
down
at
night
,
lie
down
unto
the
Lord
,
that
he
may
watch
over
you
in
your
sleep
;
and
when
thou
risest
in
the
morning
,
let
thy
heart
be
full
of
thanks
unto
God
:
and
if
ye
do
these
things
,
ye
shall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
.
And
now
my
son
,
I
have
somewhat
to
say
concerning
the
thing
which
our
fathers
call
a
ball
,
or
director
;
or
our
fathers
called
it
liahona
,
which
is
,
being
interpreted
,
a
compass
;
and
.
the
Lord
prepared
it
.
And
behold
,
there
cannot
any
man
work
after
the
manner
of
so
curious
a
workmanship
.
And
behold
,
it
was
prepared
to
shew
unto
our
fathers
the
course
which
they
should
travel
in
the
wilderness
:
and
it
di
work
for
them
according
to
their
faith
in
God
;
therefore
if
they
had
faith
to
believe
that
God
could
cause
that
those
.
spindles
should
point
the
way
they
should
go
,
behold
,
it
was
done
;
therefore
they
had
this
muaecle
,
and
also
,
many
other
miracles
wrought
by
the
power
of
God
,
day
hy
day
;
nevertheless
,
becaus
?
those
-
miracles
.
were
.
worked
:
by
small
means
,
it
did
shew
unto
them
marvelous
works
...
They
were
sloth
[File:347]
fal
,
and
forgot
to
exercise
their
faith
and
diligence
,
and
then
those
marvelous
works
ceased
,
and
they
did
not
progress
in
their
journey
;
therefore
they
tarried
in
the
wilderness
,
or
did
net
travel
a
direct
course
,
and
were
afflicted
with
hunger
and
thirst
,
because
of
their
transgressions
.
And
now
my
son
,
I
would
that
ye
should
understand
that
these
things
are
not
without
a
shadow
;
for
as
our
fathers
were
slothful
to
give
heed
to
this
compass
,
(
now
these
things
were
temporal
,)
they
did
not
prosper
;
even
so
it
is
with
things
which
are
spiritual
.
For
behold
,
it
is
as
easy
to
give
heed
to
the
word
.
of
Christ
,
which
will
point
to
you
a
straight
course
to
eternal
bliss
,
as
it
was
for
our
fathers
to
give
heed
to
this
compass
,
which
would
point
unto
them
a
straight
course
to
the
promised
land
.
And
now
[
say
,
is
there
notatypein
this
thing
?
For
just
as
suredly
as
this
director
did
bring
our
fathers
,
by
following
its
course
,
to
the
promised
land
,
shall
the
words
of
Christ
,
if
we
follow
their
course
,
carry
us
beyond
this
vale
of
sorrow
,
into
a
far
better
land
of
promise
.
O
my
son
,
do
not
let
us
be
slothful
because
of
the
easiness
of
the
way
;
for
so
was
it
with
our
fathers
;
for
so
was
it
prepared
for
them
,
that
if
they
would
look
,
they
might
live
;
even
so
itis
withus
..
The
way
is
prepared
,
and
if
we
will
look
,
we
may
live
forever
.
And
now
my
son
,
see
that
ye
take
care
of
these
sacred
things
;
yea
,
see
that
ye
look
to
God
and
live
.
Go
unto
this
people
,
and
declare
the
word
,
and
be
sober
,
My
son
,
farewell
.

My

,
give
ear
to
my
words
:
for
I
say
unto
you
,
even
as
I
said
unto
Helaman
,
that
inasmuch
as

,
ye

And
now
my

'I

even

say
unto
youmy
son
,
that
I'have
had
great
joy
in
thee
already
,
because
of
thy
faithfulness
,
and
thy
diligence
,
and
thy
patience
,
and
thy
long
suffering
among
the
peop'e
of
the
Goramites
.
For
I
knew
that
thou
wast
in
bonds
;
yea
,
and
[also
knew
tnat
thou
,
wast
stoned
fo
,
the
word's
sake
;
and
thou
didst
bear
ail
these
things
with
patience
,
because
the
Lord
was
with
thee
:
and
new
thou
knowest
that
the
Lord
did
deliver
thee
.
And
-
now
my
son
Shibloa
,
I
.
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
as
much
as
ye
shall
put
your
trest
in
God
,
even
so
inuch
ye
shall
be

out
of

trials
,
and
your
troubles
,
and
your
aillictions
;
and
ye
shall
be
lifled
up
at
the
last
day
.
Now
my
son
,
I
would
not
that
ye
;
should
think
that
I
-
know
these
things
of
myself
,
bul
itis
the
spirit
of
God
which
is
in
me
,
which
maketh
these
things
known
unto
me
:
for
if
Thad
not
been
born
of
God
,
I
should
not
have
known
these
things
.
But
behold
,
the
Lord
in
his
great
mercy
setit
his
angel
to
declare
unto
me
,
that
I
must
stop
the
work
of
destruction
among
his
people
;
yea
,
and
have
seen
an
angel
face
to
face
;
and
ne
spake
with
me
,
and
his
voice
was
as
thunder
,
and
it
shook
ihe
whole
earth
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Twas
three
days
and
three
,
nights
in
the
most
bitter
pain
and
anguish
of
soul
;
and
never
,
until
I
did
ery

unto
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
for
mercy
,
did
[
receive
a
remission
of
my
sins
.
But
behold

and
I
did
find
peace
to
my

And
now
my

Commandments
of
Alma
,
to
his
son
Corianton
.
Asp
now
my
son
,
I
have
somaiwhat
more
to
say
unto
thee
than
what
I
said
unto
thy
brother
:
for
behold
,
have
ye
not
observed
the
steadiness
of
thy
brother
,
his
faithfulness
,
and
his
diligence
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
God
?
Behold
,
has
he
not
set
a
good
example
for
thee
?
For
thou
didst
not
give
so
mucl
:
heed
unto
my
words
as
did
thy
brother
,
among
the
people
of
the
Zoramites
.
Now
this
is
what
I
have
against
thee
;
thou
didst
go
on
unte
boasting
in
thy
strength
,
and
thy
wisdom
.
And
this
is
not
all
,
myson
.
Thou
didst
do
that
which
was
grievous
unto
me
;
for
thou
didst
forsake
the
ministry
,
and
did
go
over
into'the
land
of
Siron
,
among
the
borders
of
the
Lamanites
,
afler
the
harlot
Isabel
;
yea
,
she
did
steal
away
the
hearts
of
many
;
but
this
was
no
excuse
for
thee
,
my
son
.
Thou
shouldst
have
tended
to
the
ministry
,
wherewith
thou
wast
entrasted
.
Know
ye
not
,
my
son
,
that
these
things
are
an
abomination
in
the
sight
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
most
abominable'
above
all
sins
,
save
it
be
the
shedding
of
innocent
.
bloood
,
or
denying
the
Holy
Ghost
?
for
behold
,
if
ye
deny
the
Holy
Ghost
when
it
once
has
had
place
in
you
,
and
ye
know
that
.
ye
deny
it
;
behold
,
this
is
asin
which
is
unpardonable
;
yea
,
and
whosoever
murdereth
against
-
the
light
and
knowledge
of
God
,
it
is
not
easy
for
him
to
obtain
forgiveness
;
yea
,
I
say
unto
you
;
my
son
,
that
it
is
not
easy
for
him
to
.
obtain
.
a
.
forgivenss
..
And
now
.
my
son
,
Io
,
would
to
God
that
ye
-
had
not
been
guilty
of
so
greatia
crime
..:
[
would
not
dwell
upon
:
your
crimes
,
to
harrow
up
your
soul
,
if
it
werenetfor
your
good
.
:
But
behold
,
yecanuot
hide
yourcrimes
from
God
;
and
except
yere
[File:350]
pent
,
they
will
stand
:
as
a
testimony
against
you
at
the
last
day
.
Now
my
son
,
I
would
that
ye
should
repent
,
and
forsake
your
sins
,
and
:
go
no
moreiafter
the
lusts
of
your
eyes
,
but
cross
yourself
in
all
these
things
;
for
except
ye
do
this
,
ye
can
in
no
wise
inherit
the
kingdom
of
God
.
O
remember
,
and
take
it
upon
you
,
and
cross
yourself
in
these
things
.
And
I
command
you
to
take
it
upon
you
to
counsel
your
elder
brothers
in
your
undertakings
;
for
behold
,
thou
art
in
thy
youth
,
and
ye
standin
need
to
be
nourished
by
your
brothers
.
And
give
heed
to
their
counsel
;
suffer
not
yourself
to
be
led
away
by
any
vain
or
foolish
thing
;
suffer
not
that
the
devil
lead
away
your
heart
again
,
after
those
wicked
harlots
.
Behold
,
O
my
son
,
how
great
iniquity
ye
brought
upon
the
4oramites
:
for
when
they
saw
your
conduct
,
they
would
not
believe
in
my
words
.
And
now
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
doth
say
unto
me
,
command
thy
children
to
do
good
,
lest
they
lead
away
the
hearts
of
many
people
to
destruction
:
therefore
[
command
you
,
my
son
,
in
the
fear
of
(
sod
,
that
ye
refrain
from
your
iniquities
;
that
ye
turn
to
the
Lord
with
all
your
mind
,
might
and
strength
;
that
ye
lead
away
the
hearts
of
no
more
,
todo
wickedly
;
but
rather
return
unto
them
,
and
acknowledge
your
faults
,
and
retain
that
wrong
which
ye
have
done
;
seek
not
after
riches
,
nor
the
vain
things
of
this
world
;
for
behold
,
you
cannot
carry
them
with
you
.
And
now
,
my
son
,
I
would
say
somewhat
unto
you
concerning
the
coming
of
Christ
.
.
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
-
it
is
he
that
surely
shail
come
,
to
take
away
the
sins
of
the
world
;
yea
,
he
cometh
to
declare
glad
tidings
of
salvation
unto
his
people
.
And
now
my
son
,
this
was
the
ministry
unto
which
ye
were
called
,
to
declare
these
glad
tidings
unto
this
people
,
to
prepare
their
minds
;
or
rather
that
salvation
might
come
unto
them
,
that
they
may
prepare
the
minds
of
their
children
to
hear
the
word
at
the
time
of
hiscoming
.
And
now
I
will
ease
your
.
mind
somewhat
on
this
subject
.
Behold
,
you
marvel
why
these
things
should
be
known
so
long
.
beforehand
.
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
is
not
4
soul
at
this
time
as
precious
.
unto
God
,
asa
soul
will
be
at
.
the
time
of
.
his
coming
?:
Is
it
not
as
necessary
that
the
plan
of
redemption
should
be
made
known
unto
this
people
,
as
well
as
unto
theirehildren
?
Is
it
not
as
easy
at
this
time
,
for
the
Lord
to
send
his
angel
to
declare
these
glad
.
tidings
unto
us
,
as
.
unto
our
childreni
or
as
-
after
the
time
of
his
coming
?,.
Now
my
son
,
here
is
somewhat
more
.
1
would
.
say
unto
-
thee
;
fort
per
[File:351]
ceive
that
thy
mind
is
:
worried
:
concerning
the
resur
:
rection
of
the
dead
.
Behold
,
I
-
say
unto
you
,
that
there
is
no
resurrection
;
or
I
.
would
say
,
in'
other
words
,
that
this
mortal
does
not
put
on
immorality
;
this
corruption
does
not
put
-
on
incorruption
,
until
af
ter
the
coming
of
Christ
.
Behold
,
he
bringeth
to
pass
;
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
.
But
behold
,
my
son
,
the'
resurrection
is
not
yet
.
Now
I
unfold
unto
you
-
a
mystery
;
nevertheless
,
there
are
many
mysteries
,
which
are
kept
,
that
no
one
knoweth
them
,
save
God
himself
.
But
1
shew
unto
you
one
thing
,
which
I
have
inquired
diligently
of
God
,
that
}
might
know
;
that
is
.
concerning
the
resurrection
.
Behold
,
there
is
a
time
appointed
that
:
all
shall
come
:
forth
from
-
the
dead
.
Now
when'
this
time
cometh
,
no
one
knows
;
but
God
knoweth
the
time
which
is
appointed
.
.
Now
:
whether
there
shall'be
one
time
,
or
a
second
time
,.
or
a
third
time
,
that
men
shall
come
forth
from
the
dead
,
it
mattereth
not
;
for
-
God
knoweth
all
these
things
;
and
it
sufficeth
meto
know
that'this
isthe
case
;
that
there
is
a
time
appointed
that
all
shall
rise
from
the
dead
..
Now
there
must
needs
bea
space
betwixt
the
time
of
death
,
and
the
time
of
the
resurrection
.
And
now
I
would
inquire
.
what
becometh
of
the
souls
of
men
,
from
this
time
of
death
,
to
the
time
appomted
for
the
resurrection
?
.
Now
whether
there
is
more
than
one
time
appointed
:
for
.
men
.
to
rise
,
it
mattereth
not
;
forall
do
net'
die
at
once
:
and
this
mattereth
not
;
all
18
a8
one
day
,
with
God
;
and
time
only
is
measured
unto
men
;
therefore
there
is
:
a
time
:
appointed
unto
:
men
,
that
they
shall
rise
from
the
dead
;
and
there
is
a
space
between
the
time
of
death
and
the
resurrection
,
And
now
concerning
this
space
:
of'
time
.
What
beeometh
of
:
the
souls
of
men
,
is
the
thing
which
I
have
inquired
diligently
of
the
Lord
to
know
;
and
this'is
the
thing
of
.
which
I
:
do
know
.
And
when
-
the
time
cometh
.
when
.
all
shail
tise
,
then
shall
they
-
know
that
God
knoweth
all
the
times
which
ire
appointed
:
unto'
man
.
=
Now
concerning
the
state
of
the
.
soul
between
death
and
-
the'
resurrection
.
Behold
,
it
-
has
been
.
made
,
known
unto
me
,
by
an
angel
,:
that
the
spirits
of
all
:
men
,
as
:
soon
as
they
are
depart
.
ed
from
-
this
mortal
body
;
yeay
:
the
spiritsof
all'men
,
whether
they
be
good
or'evil
,
are
taken
home
to
that
God
who
-
gave
:
them
life
.
And
:
then
shall
it
comie
to
pass
the
spirits
of
those
who
are
righteous
,
are
received
[File:352]
Â¥
into
a
state
of
:
happiness
,
which
:
is
called
paradise
;
a
.
state
of
rest
;
a
state
of
peace
,
where
they
shall
rest
from
all
:
their
-
troubles
,
and
from
all
care
,
and
sorrow
,
&c
.
And
then
shall
it
come
to
pass
,
that
the
spirits
of
the
wicked
,
yea
,
who
.
are
evil
;
for
behold
,
they
have
no
-:
part
nor
portion
of
the
spirit
.
of
the
Lord
;
for
behold
,
they
choose
evil
works
,
rather
than
good
;
therefore
the
spirit
of
the
devil
did
enter
into
them
,
and
take
possession
of
their
house
;
and
these
shall
be
cast
outinto
outer
darkness
;
there
shall
be
weeping
,
and
wailing
,
and
gnashing
of
teeth
;
and
this
because
of
their
own
iniquity
;
being
led
captive
by
the
will
of
the
devil
.
Now
this
isthe
state
of
the
souls
of
the
wicked
;
yea
,
in
darkness
,
and
a
state
of
awful
,
fearful
,
looking
for
of
the
fiery
indignation
of
the
wrath
of
God
upon
them
;
thus
they
remain
in
-
this
state
,
as
well
as
the
righteous
in
paradise
,
until
the
time
of
their
resurrection
,
_
Now
there
are
some
that
have
understood
that
this
state
of
happiness
,
and
this
state
of
misery
of
the
soul
,
before
the
resurrection
,
was
a
first
resurrection
.
Yea
,
]
.
admit
it
may
be
termed
a
resurrection
;
the
raising
of
the
spirit
or
the
soul
,
and
their
consignation
to
happiness
or
misery
,
according
to
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
.
And
behold
,
agaio
it
hath
been
spoken
,
that
there
is
a
first
resurrection
;
2
resurrection
.
of
.
all
those
who
have
been
,
or
who
are
,
or
who
shall
bs
,
down
to
the
resurrection
of
Christ
from
the
dead
:
Now
we
do
not
suppose
that
this
first
resurrection
which
is
spoken
of
in
this
manner
,
can
be
the
resurrection
of
the
souls
,
and
their
consignation
to
happiness
or
misery
.
Ye
cannot
suppose
that
this
is
whatit
meaneth
.
Behold
,
I
say
unto
you
nay
;
but
it
meaneth
the
re
-
uniting
of
the
soul
with
the
body
of
those
from
the
days
of
Adam
,
down
tothe
resurrection
of
Christ
.
Now
whether
the
souls
and
the
bodies
of
those
of
whom
have
been
spoken
,
shall
all
be
re
-
united
at
once
,
the
wicked
as
well
es
the
righteous
,
I
do
not
say
:
let
it
suffice
,
that
I
say
that
they
all
come
forth
:
or
in
other
words
,
their
resurrection
cometh
to
.
pass
before
the
resurrection
of
those
who
.
die
after
the
resurrection
of
Christ
.
Now
my
son
,
Ido
not
say
that
their
resurrection
cometh
at
the
resurrection
of
Christ
;
but
behold
,
I
give
it
as
my
opinion
,
that
the
souls
and
the
bodies
are
re
-
united
,.
of
the
righteous
,
at
:
the
-
resulrectionÂ®
of
'
Christ
,
'
:
and
his
assension
:
into
.
heaven
.
But
whether
it
:
beat
:
his
resurrection
,
or
after
,
Ido
not
say
;
but
this
much
I
say
,
that
there
is
a
space
between
[File:353]
death
:
and
the
resurrection
of
the
body
,
:
and
a
state
of
the
soul
:
in
happiness
or
-
in
misery
,
until
the
time
whichis
appointed
of
God
-
that
the
dead
.
shall
come
forth
,
and
be
re
-
united
,
both
soul
and
body
,
and
be
brought
to
stand
before
God
,
and
be
judged
according
to
their
works
;
.
yea
,
this
bringeth
about
-
the
restoration
of
those
things
of
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
mouths
-
of
the
prophets
.
The
soul
shall
be
restored
.
to
the
body
,
and
the
body
to
the
soul
;
yea
,
and
every
limb
and
-
joint
shall
be
restored
to
.
itsbody
;
yea
,
even
a
hair
of
the
head
shall
not
be
lost
,
but
all
-
things
shall
be
restored
to
their
proper
and
perfect
frame
.
And
now
my
son
,
this
is
the
restoration
of
whieh
.
has
been
spoken
by
the
.
mouths
of
the
prophets
:
And
then
shallthe
righteous
shine
forth
in
the
kingdom
of
God
,
But
behold
,
-
an
awful
death
cometh
upon
the
wicked
;
for
they
dieas
to
things
pertaining
to
things
of
righteousness
;
for
they
are
unclean
,
and
no
unclean
thing
can
inherit
the
kingdom
of
God
;
but
they
are
cast
out
,
and
consigned
to
partake
of
the
fruits
of
their
labors
or
their
works
,
which
have
been
evil
;
and
they
drink
the
dregs
of
a
bitter
cup
.
And
now
my
son
,
I
have
somewhat
to
say
concerning
the
restoration
of
which
has
been
spoken
;
for
behold
,
some
have
wrested
the
scriptures
,
and
have
gone
farastray
,
because
of
this
thing
.
And
I
perceive
that
thy
mind
.
has
been
worried
also
,
concerning
this
thing
.
But
:
behold
,
I
.
will
explain
it
unto
.
thee
.
-
I
say
unto
tliee
,
my
son
,
that
the
plan
of
restoration
is
requisite
with
the
justice
of
God
;
for
it
is
requisite
that
all
things
should
be
restored
:
to
their
proper
order
.
Behold
;
it
is
requisite
and
just
,
according
.
to
the
.
power
and
resurrection
of
Christ
,
that
the
soul
of
man
should
be
restored
'to'
its
body
,
and
that
every
part
of
the
oor
should
:
be
restored
to
itself
.
And
it
is
requisite
wit
the
justice
of
God
,
that
-
men
should
be
judged
according
to
their
works
;
and
if
their
works
.
were
good
:
in
this
life
;
and
the
desires
of
their
hearts
weregood
,
that
they
should
also
,
atthe
last
day
,
be
restored
:
unto
:
that
which
is
good
;
and
if
their
works
are
evil
,
they
shall
be
restored
unto
.
hinr
for
:
evil
;
therefore
,
all
things
shall
be
restored
to
their
proper
order
;
every
thing
to
its
natural
frame
;
mortality
raised
to

;

to

,
to'inherit
the

of

,
or
to
:

,
to
inherit
the

of

;

.
and
the
other
to
evil
,
according
to'hix
desires
of
evil
;
for
as
he
has
desired
to
do
evil
al]
the
day
long
,
even
go
shalt
he
haye
his
reward
of
evil
,
when
the
night
cometh
.
.
And
go
it
is
on
the
other
hand
.
-
If
he
hath
repented
of
his
sins
,
and
desired
.
righteousness
until
the
end
of
his
days
,
even
so
he
shall
.
be
rewarded
unto
righteousness
.
These
are
they
that
are
redeemed
of
the
Lord
:
yea
,
these
are
they
that
are
taken
.
out
,
that
are
delivered
from
that
endless
night
of
darkness
;
and
thus
they
stand
-
or
.
fall
;
for
behold
,
they
are
their
own
judges
,
whether
to
.
do
good
or
doevil
.
Now
the
decrees
of
God
are
unalterable
;
therefore
.
the
way
is
prepared
,
that
whosoever
will
,
may
walk
therein
and
be
saved
.
And
now
behold
,
myson
,
do
not
risk
one
more
-
offence
against
-
your
God
upon
those
points
of
doctrine
,
which
ye
have
hitherto
:
risked
.
to
commit
sin
.
Do
not
suppose
,
because
it
has
been
spoken
.
concerning
restoration
;
that
ye
shall
be
restored
.
from
,
sin
to
happiness
.
Behold
I
say
unto
you
,
wickedness
never
was
happiness
.
And
now
,
niy
son
,
all
-
men
tnat
are
.
in
a
state
of
nature
,
or
I
would
say
,
ina
carnal
state
,
are
in
the
gall
of
bitterness
,
and
in
the
bonds
of
:
niquity
;
they
are
without
God
in
the
world
,
and
:
they
have
gone
contrary
to
the
nature
of
God
;
therefore
-
they
are
ina
state
contrary
to
the
nature
of
happiness
.
.
And
now
behold
,
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
restoration
,
to
take
a
thing
of'a
natural
state
,
and
place
it
in
an
unnatural
state
,
or
to
place
:
it
in
a
.
state
opposite
to
its
nature
?
O
,
my
-
son
,
this
-
it
not
the
case
;
but
the
meaning
of
the
word
restoration
,
is
to
bring
back
again
evil
for
evil
,
or
carnal
for
carnal
,
or
devilistifor
devilish
;
good
for
that
which
is

;
righteous
for
that
which
is
righteous
;
just
for
that
which
is
just
;
merciful
for
that
which
is
merciful
;
therefore
,
my
.
son
,
see
that
ye
are
merciful
unto
your
.
brethren
;
deal
justly
,
judge
righteously
,
and
do
good
.
continually
;
and
if
yedo
all
these
things
,
then
shall
ye
receive
your
reward
;
yea
,
ye
shall
have

;
ye
shall
have

ye
shall

perceive
:
there
.
is
:
eomewhat
[File:355]
more
which
dothworry
:
your
mind
,
which
ye
cannot
understand
,
which
is
concerning
the
justice
of
God
,
in
the
punishment
of
the
sinner
::
for
yedo
try
to
.
suppose
that
-
it
is
injustice
that
:
the
sinner
should
be
consigned
to
a
state
of
misery
.
.
Now
behold
,
my
son
,
I
will
explain
this
thing'unto
thee
:
for
behold
,
after
the
Lord
God
sent
our
.
first
parents
forth
from
the
garden
of
Eden
to
:
till
the
ground
,
from
whence
they
were
taken
;
yea
,
he
drew
out
the
man
,
and
he
placed
at
the
east
end
.
of
the
garden
of
Eden
,
Cherubim
,
anda
flaming
sword
which
turned
every
way
,
to
keep
the
tree
of
life
.
Now
-
we
see
that
the
man
had
became
as
God
,
knowing
good
and
evil
;
and
lest
he
should
put
forth
his
hand
,
and
take
also
of
the
tree
of
life
,
and
eat
,
and
live
forever
,
the
Lord
God
placed
Cherubim
and
the
flaming
sword
,
that
he
should
not
partake
of
the
fruit
;
and
thus
we
see
,
that
:
there
was
.
a
time
granted
unto
man
,
to
repent
,
yea
;
a
probationary
time
,
a
time
to
repent
and
-
serve
God
.
For
behold
,
if
Adam
:
had
put
forth
-
his
hand
immediately
,
and
partook
:.
of
the
tree
of
life
,
he
-
would
have
lived
forever
;
according
to
the
word
of
God
,
having
no
space
for
repentance
;
yea
,
and
also
-
the
word
of
God
would
-
hayve
been
void
,
and
the
great
plan
of
salvation
,
would
have
been
frustrated
.
But
behold
,
it
was
appointed
unto
man
to
die
;
therefore
us
they
were
cut
off
from
the
tree
of
life
,
they
should
be
cut
off
from
the
face
of
the
earth
;
and
man
became
lost
forever
;
yea
,
they
became
fallen
man
.
And
now
we
see
by
this
,
that
.
our
:
first
parents
were
cut
off
,
both
temporally
and
spiritually
,
from
the
press
ence
of
the
Lord
;
and
.
thus
we
see
they
became
subjects
to
follow
after
their
own
will
,
Now
behold
,
it
was
not
expedienti
that
man
should
be
reclaimed
from
this
temporal
.
death
,
for
that
would
destroy
the
great
plan
of
happiness
;
therefore
,
as
the
soul
:
could
never
die
,
and
the
fall
-
had
brought
upon
.
all
mankid
a
spiritual
death
as
well
.
as
a
temporal
;
that
-
is
,
they
were
cut
off
from
.
the
presence
of
the
Lord
;
it
was
.
expedient
that
:
mankind
should
:
be
reclaimed
from
:
this
:
spiritual
death
;
therefore
as
:
they
had
become
carnal
,
sensual
and
devilish
,
by
nature
,
this
probationary
-
state
became
a
.
state
for
them
to
prepare
:
it
became
a
preparatory
state
.
And
-
now
remember
,:
my
son
,
if
it
:
were
not
-
for
the
plan
.
of
redemption
,
(
laying
:
it
-
aside
,)
as
-
soon
as
they
were
dead
,
their
souls
were
miserable
,
being
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the'
Lord
.::
/
:
And
now
.
there
-
was
no
:
means
to
:
reclaim
men
fiom
this'
fallen
state
which
&
[File:356]
man
had
:
brought
upon
himself
,
becatse
.
of
his
own
disobedience
;
therefore
,
according
to
justice
,
the
plan
of
redemption
could
not
be
brought
about
,
only
,
on
conditions
of
repentance
of
men
in
this
probationary
state
;
yea
,
this
..
preparatory
state
;.
for
except
it
were
for
these
conditions
,
â
mercy
could
not
take
effect
except
it
should
destroy
the
work
of
justice
.
Now
the
work
of
justice'
could
-
not
.
be
destroyed
:
if'so
,
God
would
cease
to
be
God
..
And
thus
we
see
.
that
all
mankind
.
were
fallen
,
and
.
they
were
in
the
.
grasp
of
justice
;
yea
,
the
justice
of
God
,
which
consigned
them
forever
to
be
cut
off
from
-
his
presence
...
And
now
-
the
planof
mercy
could
not
be
brought
:
about
,
except
an
atonement
shouldbe
made
;
therefore
God
himself
atoneth
forthe
-
sins
of
the
world
,
to
!
bring
about
the
plan
of
mercy
,
to
appease
the
demands
of
justice
,
that
God
might
be
a
perfect
,
just
-
God
,
and
a'merciful
God
also
.
Now
repentance
could
not
come
unto
men
,
except
there
were
-
a
punishment
,
which
also
was
as
eternal
as
the
.
life
of
the
soulshould
be
,
:
affixed
.
opposite
to
the
plan
-
of
happiness
,
which
was
as
eternal'also
.
as
the
life
of
the
soul
.
--
Now
,
how
could
a
man
repent
,
except
he
should
sin
?:
How
could
he
sin
,
if
there
was
nolaw
,
how
could
there
-
be'
a
law
,
save
there
was
.
a
punishment
?
Now'
there
was
a
punishment
affixed
,
anda
just
law
given
,
which
brought
remorse
of
conscience
unto
man
.
Now
:
if
there
-
was
no
law
given
,
if
a
man
murdered
he
should
die
,
would
he
be
afraid
he
should
die
if
he
should
.
murder
?
And
also
;
if
there
was
.
no
law
given
:
againstsin
,
men
would
-
not
.
be
afraid
to
sin
.
â
And
if
there
-
was
no
law
given
if
men
sinned
,
what
could
justice
do
,
or
mercy
either
:
for
they
.
would
have
:
noclaim
upon
the
creature
.
But
there
isalaw
:
given
,
and
a
punishment
.
affixed
,
and
.
repentance
granted
;
which
repentance
,
mercy
claimeth
:
otherwise
,
justice
.
claimeth
.
the'
creature
,
and
-
executeth
the
law
,
and
the
law
inflicteth
:
the
punishment
;
if
not
so
,
the
works
.
of'
justice
would
be
destroyed
,
and
:
God
would
cease
tobe
God
.
But
God
conseth
not'to
be
:
God
,
and
mercy
elaimeth
the
penttent
,
and
merey
:
cometh
because
of
the
atonement
;
and
the
-
atonement
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
;
and
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
:
bringeth
back
men
into
:
the
presence
of
God
;
and
thus
they
are
restored
into
his
\presence
;:
to
be
-
judged
-
according
:
to
their
works
;
according
to
the'
law
and
justice
;
for

own
;,
and
thus
,
none
but
the
.
truly
:
penitent
are
saved
.
.
What
,
do
ye
suppose
that
mercy
can
rob
justice
?
.
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
;
not
one

.
.
Ifso
,
God
would

And
thus
God
bringeth

about
his
:
great
and
eternal
purposes
,
which
were
prepared
from
..
the
foundation
of
the
world
..
And
thus
cometh'
about
the
salvation
and
the
redemption
of
.
men
,
and
also
:
their
destruction
.
and
misery
;
therefore
,
O
my
son
,
whosoever
will
come
,
may
come
,
and
.
partake
of
the
waters
of
life
freely
;
and
whosoever
will
not
come
,
the
same
is
not
compelled
to
.
come
;
but
.
in
the
last
day
,
it
shall
be
restored
unto
him
,
according
to
his
deeds
.,
If
he
has
desired
to
do
evil
,
and
-
has
not
repented
in
his
days
,
behold
,
evil
shall
be
done
unto
him
,
according
to
the
restoration
of
God
..
And
now
my
son
,
I
desire
that
ye
should
let
these
things
trouble
you
no
more
,
and
only
let
your
sins
trouble
you
,
with
that
.
trouble
which
shall
bring
.
you
down
unto
repentance
.
O
my
son
,
I
desire
that
ye
should
deny
the
justice
of
God
no
more
.
_
Do
-
not
endeavor
to
.
excuse
yourself
in
the
least
.
point
,
because
of
your
sins
,
by
denying
the
justice
of
God
,
but
do
you
let
the
justice
of
God
,
and
his
mercy
,
and
his
-
long
suffering
,
have
full
sway
in
-
your
heart
;
but
let
it
bring
you
down
to
the
dust
in
humility
.
And
now
,
O
my
son
,
ye
are
called
of
God
to
preach
the
word
unto
this
people
.
And
now
,
my
son
,
go
thy
way
,
declare
the
word
with
truth
and
.
soberness
,
that
thou
mayest
bring
souls
unto
repentance
,
that
the
great
gin
of
mercy
may
have
claim
upon
them
.
And
may
God
grant
unto
:
you
even
according
to
my
words

CHAPTER
XX
.
Anp
now
it
came
to
.
pass
,
that
the
sons
of
Alma
did
go
.
forth
among
the
people
,
to
declare
the
word
unto
them
,
And
Alma
also
,
himself
,
could
not
rest
,
and
he
also
went
forth
.
Now
we
-
shall
say
no
more
concerning'
their
preaching
,
except
that
they
preached
the
word
,
and
the
truth
,
according
to
the
spirit
of
propheey
-
and
,
revelation
:
and
.
they
preached
after
the
holy
order
of
Gad
,
by
which
they
were
called
...
..;
.
And
.
now
Lreturn
to
an
account
.
of
the
wars
between
[File:358]
the
Nephites
andthe
Lamanites
,
in'
the
eighteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
For
belrold
;
it
came
to
pass
thatthe
Zoramites
became
Larnmanites
;
therefore
in
the
commencement
of
the
eighteenth
year
,
the
people
of
the
Nephites
:
saw
that
the
Lamanites
were
coming
upon
them
;
therefore
they
made
preparations
for
war
;
yea
,
they
gathered
together
their
armies
in
the
land
of
Jershon
.
And
it
came
to
pags
that
the
Lamanites
came
with
their
thousands
;
and
they
came
into
the
land
of
Antionum
,
which
was
the
land
of
the
Zoramites
;
and'a
man
by
the
name
of
Zerahemnah
was
their
leader
.
And
now
as
the
Amalekites
were
of
amore
wicked
and
a
murderous
disposition
than
the
Lamanites
were
;
in
and
of
themselves
,
therefore
Zerahemnah
appointed
chief
captains
over
the
Lamanites
,
and
they
were
all
the
Amalekites
and
the
Zoramites
.
Now
this
he
did
;
that
-
he
might
preserve
their
hatred
towards
the
Nephites
;
thathe
might
bring
them
.
into
subjection
,
to
the
-
accomplishment
of
his
designs
;
for
behold
,
his
designs
were
to
stir
up
the
.
Lamanites
to
anger
against
the
Nephites
;
this
he
did
that
he
might
usurp
great
power
over
them
;
and
also
that
he
might
gain
power
over
the
Nephites
,
by
bringing
them
into
bondage
,
&c
.
And
now
the'
design
of
the
Nephites
was
to
support
their
lands
,
and
their
houses
,
and
their
wives
,
and
their
children
,
that
:
they
might
preserve
them
from
the
hands
of
their
enemies
;
and
ajso
,
that
they
might
preserve
their
rights
and
their
privileges
;
yea
,
and
also
their
liberty
,
that
they
might
worship
{zod
according
to
their
desires}
for
they
knew
that
if
they
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
whosoever
should
worship
God
,
in
spirit
and
in
trath
,
tae
true
and
the
living
God
,
the
Lamanites
would
desoy
;
yea
,
and
they
also
-
knew
the
extreme
hatred
of
the
Lamanites
towards
their
brethren
,
who
were
the
people
of
Anti
-
Nephi
-
Lehi
;
who
were
called
the
people
of
Ammon
;
and
they
would
not
take
up
arms
;
yea
,
they
had
entered
into
a
covenant
,
and
they
-
would
not
break
it
;
therefore
,
if
they
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
they
would
be
destroyed
.
And
the
Nephites
would
not
suffer
that
they
should
be
destroyed
;
therefore
they
gave
them
lands
for
their
inheritance
.
And
.
the
people
of
Ammon
:
did
give
unto
the
Nephites
a
large
portion
of
their
.
substance
,
to
support
their
armies
;
and
thus
-
the
Nephites
were
compelled
,
alone
,
to
withstand
againstthe
:
Lamanites
,
who
were
a
compound
of
Laman
and
,
Lemuel
;
and
the
sons
of
[File:359]
Ishmael
,
and
all
those
who
had
dissented
.
from
the
Nephites
,
who
were
.
Amalekites
,
and
Zoramites
,
and
the
descendants
of
the
priests
.
of
Noah
.
Now
those
descendants
were
as
numerous
,
nearly
,
as
were
the
Nephites
;
and
thus
the
Nephites
were
obliged
to
contend
with
their
-
brethren
,
even
unto
bloodshed
.
And
it
came
to
pass
,
as
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
had
gathered
together
in
the
land
of
Antionum
,
behold
,
.
the
armies
of
the
:
Nephites
.
were
prepared
to
meet
them
in
the
land
of
Jershon
.
Now
the
leader
of
the
Nephites
,
or
the
man
who
had
been
appointed
to
be
the
chief
captain
over
the
Nephites
:
Now
the
chief
captain
took
:
the
command
of
all
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
;
and
his
name
was
Moroni
;
and
Moroni
.
took
all
the
command
,
and
the
governments
of
their
,
wars
.
And
he
was
only
twenty
and
five
years
old
when
he
ae
appointed
chief
captain
over
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
met
the
Lamanites
.
in
the
borders
of
Jershon
,
and
his
people
were
armed
with
swords
,
and
with
cimeters
,
.
and
all
manner
of
weapons
of
war
.
And
when
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
saw
that
the
people
of
Nephi
,
or
that
Moroni
had
prepared
his
people
with
breast
-
plates
,
and
with
arm
-
shields
;,
yea
,
and
also
shields
to
defend
their
heads
;
and
also
they
were
dressed
with
thick
clothing
.
Now
the
army
of
Zerahemnah
was
not
prepared
with
-
any
such
thing
.
They
had
only
their
swords
,
and
their
-
cimeters
,
their
bows
and
their
arrows
,
their
stones
and
their
slings
;
but
they
were
naked
,
save
it
were
a
skin
which
was
girded
!
about
their
loins}
;
yea
,
all
were
naked
,
save
it
were
the
Zoramites
and
the
Amalekites
..
But
they
were
not
armed
with
breastplates
,
nor
shields
;
therefore
they
were
exceeding
fraid
of
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
,
because
of
their
armour
,
notwithstanding
their
number
being
so
much
greater
than
the
Nephites

Behold

:
it

that

But
.
it
came
:
to
pass
;
as
-
soon
as
:
they
-
had
[File:360]
departed
into
the
wilderness
;
Moroni
sent
spies
into
the
wilderness
,
to
watch
their
camp
;
and
Moroni
;
al80
;
knowing
of
the
prophecies
of
Alma
,
sent'
certain
men
unto
him
,
desiring
him
that
he
should
inquire
of
the
Lord
whither
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
should
go
,
to
defend
themselves
against
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
word
of
the
Lord
came
unto
Alma
,
and
Alma
informed
the
.
messengers
of
Moroni
that
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
were
marching
round
abeut
in
the
wilderness
,
that
they
might
come
over
into
the
land
of
Manti
,
that
they
might
commence
an
attack
upon
the
more
weak
part
of
the
people
.
And
those
messengers
went
and
delivered
the
message
unto
Moroni
,
Now
Moroni
,
leaving
a
part
ofthis
army
in
the
land
of
Jershon
,
lest
by
any
means
,
a
part
of
the
Lamanites
should
come
into
that
land
and
take
possession
of
the
city
,
took
the
remainder
part
of
his
army
and
marched
over
into
the
land
of
Manti
..
And
he
caused
that
all
the
people
in
that
quarter
of
the
land
,
should
gather
themselves
together
to
battle
,
against
the
Lamanites
,
to
defend
their
lands
and
their
country
,
their
rights
and
their
liberties
;
therefore
they
were
prepared
against
the
time
of
the
coming
of
the
Lamanites
..
And
it
came
to
pass
,
that
Moroni
caused
that
his
army
should
be
,
secreted
in
the
valley
which
was
near
the
bank
of
the
river
Sidon
;
which
was
on
the
west
of
the
river
Sidon
,
in
the
wilderness
.
And
Moroni
placed
:
spies
round
about
,
that
he
might
know
when
the
camp
of
the
Lamanites'should
come
.
And
now
as
Moroni
knew
the
intention
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
it
was
their
intention
to
destroy
their
brethren
,
or
to
subject
them
and
bring
them
into
bondage
,
that
they
might
establish
a
kingdom
unto
themselves
,
over
all
the
land
;
and
he
also
knowing
that
it
was
the
only
desire
of
the
Nephites
to
preserve
their
lands
,
and
their
liberty
and
their
church
,
therefore
he
thought
it
no
sin
that
he
should
defend
them
by
stratagem
;
therefore
he
found
,
by
bis
spies
,
which
course
the
Lamanites
were
to
take
.
Therefore
he
divided
his
army
,
and
brought
a
part
over
into
the
valley
,
and
concealed
:
them
on
the
-
east
,
and
on
the
south
of
the
hill
Riplah
;
and
the
remainder
he'
concealed
in
the
west
valley
,
on
the
west
of
the
river
Sidon
,
and
so
down
into
the
borders
-
of
the
land
Manti
.
And
thus
having
placed
-
his
army
according'
:
to
his
.
desire
;
he
was
prepared
to
.
meet
them
.
[File:361]
And
it
-
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
came
,
ap
on
the
north
of
the
hill
where
a
part
of
the
army
of
Moroni
was
concealed
.
And
as
the
Lamanites
:
had
passed
the
hill
Riplah
,
and
come
.
into
the
valley
,
and
began
to
cross
the
river
Sidon
,
the
army
which
was
concealed
on
the
south
of
the
hill
,
which
was
led
by
aman
whose
name
was
Lehi
;
and
he
led
his
army
forth
and
encircled
the
Lamanites
about
,
on
the
east
,
in
their
rear
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
,
when
they
saw
the
Nephites
coming
upon
them
in
their
rear
,
turned
them
about
,
and
began
to
contend
with
the
army
of
Lehi
;
and
the
work
.
of
death
commenced
,
on
both
sides
;
but
it
was
more
dreadful
on
the
part
of
the
Lamanites
;
for
their
nakedness
was
exposed
to
the
heavy
blows
of
the
Nephites
,
with
their
swords
.
and
their
cimeters
,
which
brought
death
almost
at
every
stroke
;
while
on
the
other
hand
,
there
was
now
and
then
a
man
fell
.
among
the
Nephites
,
by
their
swords
,
and
the
loss
of
blood
;
they
being
shielded
from
the
more
vital
parts
of
the
body
,
or
the
more
yital
parts
of
the
body
being
shielded
from
the
strokes
of
the
Lamanites
,
by
their
breast
-
plates
,
and
their
arm
-
shields
,
and
their
head
-
plates
;
and
thus
.
the
Nephites
did
carry
on
the
work
of
death
among
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
became
.
frightened
,
because
of
the
great
destruction
among
them
,
even
until
they
began
to
flee
towards
the
river
Sidon
..
And
they
were
pursued
by
-
Lebi
and
his
men
,
and
they
were
driven
by
Lehi
into
the
waters
of
Sidon
;
and
they
crossed
the
waters
of
Sidon
.
And
Lehi
retained
-
his
.
armies
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
Sidon
,
that
they
should
not
cross
.
_
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
and
his
-
army
met
the
Lamanites
in
the
valley
,
on
the
other
side
of
,
the
river
Sidon
,
and
Began
to
fall
upon
them
,
and
to
,
slay
them
.
And
.
the
Lamanites
did
flee
again
before
them
,
towards
the
land
.
of
Manti
;
and
they
were
met
,
again
by
the
armies
.
of
.
Moroni
.
Now
in
this
:
case
,
the
Lamanites
did
fight
exceedinly
;
yea
,
never
,
hac
.
the
.
Lamanites
been
known
.
to
fight
with
.
such
,
exceeding
great
.
strength
.
and
courage
;
-
no
,,
not
.
even
from
:
the
.
beginning
:
.
and
they
were
inspired
,
by
the
:
Zoramites
,
and
:
the
Amalekites
,
who
were
their
chief
captains
and
leadersy
:
and
by
Zerahemnahy
.
who
.
was
their
chief
captainj
-
or
-
their
chief
.
leader
.
and
commander
;,
jyea
,,.
they
did
fightJike
dragons
;
'
and
many
.
of
the
-
Nephites
were
[File:362]
slain'
by
their
hands
;
yea
,
for
they
did
smite
in
two
many
of
their
-
head
-
plates
;
'
and
they
did'
pierce
many
of
their
breast
-
plates
;
andthey
did
smite
off
many
of
their
arms
;
and
thas
the
Lamanites
did
smite
in
their
fierce
anger
.
-
Nevertheless
,
the
Nephites
were
inspired
by
a
better
cause
;
for
they
were
not
fighting
for
monarchy
nor
power
;
but
they
were
fighting
for
their
homes
,
and
their
liberties
;
their
wives
,
and
their
children
,
and
their
all
;
yea
,
for
their
rites
of
worship
,
and
their
church
;
and
they
were
doing
that
which
they
felt
:
was
the
duty
which
they
owed
to
their
God
;
for
the
Lord
had
said
unto
them
,
and
also
unto
their
fathers
,
that
inasmuch
as
ye
are
not
guilty
of
the
first
offence
,
neither
the
second
,
ye
shall
not
suffer
yourselves
to
be
slain
by
the
hands
of
your
enemies
.
And
again
,
the
Lord
has
saidthat
ye
shall
defend
-
your
families
,
even
-
unto
bloodshed
;
therefore
for
this
cause
were
the
Nephites
contending
with
the
Lamanites
,
to
defend
themselves
,
and
their
families
,
and
their
lands
,
their
country
,
and
their
rights
,
and
their
religion
.
And
it
came
:
to
pass
that
when
the
men
of'
Moroni
saw
-
the
fierceness
and
the
anger
of
the
Lamanites
,
they
were
about
to
shrink
and
Hee
from
them
.
And
Moroni
,
perceiving
their
intent
,
sent
forth
and
inspired
their
hearts
with
these
thoughts
;
yea
,
the
thoughts
of
their
lands
,
their
liberty
,
yea
,
their
freedom
trom
bondage
.
And
it
eame
to
pass
that
they
turned
upon
the
Lamanites
,
and
they
eried
with
one
voice
unto
the
Lord
their
God
,
for
their
liberty
,
and
their
freedom
from
bondage
.
And
they
began
to
stand
against
the
Lamanites
with
power
;
and
-
in
that
self
-
same
hour
that
they
cried
unto
the
Lord
for
their
freedom
,
the
Lamanites
began
to
flee
before
them
;
and
they
fled
even
to
the
waters
of
Sidon
.
Now
the
.
Lamanites
Were
nrore'numerous}
yea
,
by
more
than'
double
the
number
of
the
Nephites
;
nevertheless
,
they
.
were
driven
insomuch
that
they
were
gathered
together
in
one
body
,
in
the
valley
,
upon
the
bank
,
by
the
river
Sidon
;
therefore
the
armies
of
Moroni
encircled
them
about
;
yea
,
evenon
both
sides
of
the
river
;
for
behold
,
on
the
east
,
were
the
men
of
Lehi
;
therefore
when
,
Zeraheninad
saw
the
men
of
Lehi
on
the
east
of
the
river
Sidon
,
and
the
armiesof
Moroni
on
the
west
of
the
river
Sidon
,
that
they
were
encircled
about
by
the
Nephites
,
they
were
struck
with
terror
.
Now
Moroni
,
when
:
he
saw
.
their
terror
,
commanded
his
men
that
they
should
stop
shedding
their
blood
:
[File:363]
And
it
:
came
to
-
pass
that
they
did
stop
,
and
:
.
withdrew
@
pace
from
them
...
And
:
\Moronisaid
unto
Ze+
rahemnah
,
behold
,
Zerahemnah
,
that
we
do
-
not
desire
to
be
men
of
blood
.
Ye
know
:
that
ye
are
in
our
hands
,
yet
we
do
not
desire
-
to
slay
you
.
-
Behold
,
we
have
not
-
ome
.
out
.
to
battle
against
you
,
that
we
might
shed
-
your
blood
,
for
power
;
neither
do
we
:
desire
to
bring
any
.
one
to
the
yoke
of
bondage
.
-
But
this
is
the
very
cause
for
which
ye
have
come
against
us
;
yea
,
and
ye
are
.
angry
with
us
because
of
our
religion
.:
'
But'now
ye
behold
that
the
Lord
.
is
with
us
;
and
ye
behold
that
he
has
delivered
you
into
.
our
hands
.
And
now
[would
that
-
ye
should
understand
that
this
is
done
unto
us
because
of
our
religion
and
our
faith
in
-
Christ
.
And
now
ye
see
that
ye
cannot
destroy
this
our
faith
.
Now
ye
see
that
this
is
the
true
faith
of
God
;
yea
,
ye
see
that
God
will
support
,
and
keep
,
and
preserve
us
,
so
long
as
we
are
faithful
unto
him
,
and
unto
our
faith
,
and
our
religion
;
and
never
will
the
Lord
suffer
that
we
shall
be
destroyed
;
except
we
should
fall
into
transgression
,
and
deny
our
faith
.
And
now
,
Zerahemnah
,
I
command
you
,
in
the
name
of
that
all
-
powerful
God
,
who
has
strengthened
our
arms
,
that
we
have
gained
power
over
you
by
our
faith
,
by
our
religion
,
and
by
our
rites
of
-
worship
;
and
by
our
church
,
and
by
the
sacred
support
which
we
owe
toour
wives
and
our
children
,
by
that
liberty
which
binds
us
to
our
.
lands
andour
country
;
yea
,
and
also
by
the
maintenance
of
the
sacred
:
word
of
God
,
to
which
we
owe
al
!
our
happiness
;
and
:
by
all
that
is
most
dear
unto
us
;
yea
,
and
this
is
not
-
all
;
Teommand
you
by
all
the
desires
:
which
ye
have
for
life
,
that
ye
deliver
up
your
weapons
of
war
unto
us
,
and
we
will
seek
not
your'
blood
,
but
we
will
spare
your
lives
,
if
ye
will
go
your
way
,
and
come
not
again
to
waragainst
us
.
And
now
if
ye
do
not
this
,
behold
,
ye
are
in

our
hands
,
and
I
will
command
my
men
that
.
they
shall
fall
upon
you
,
and
inflict
the
wounds
:
of
death
in

bodies
,
that
ye
may
become
extinct
;
and
then
we
will
see
who
shall

have
power
over
this
people
;
yea
,
we
will
see
who
shall
be
brought
into
bondage
.
And
now
it
came
.
to
pass
that
when
Zerahemnah
had
heard
these
sayings
;
he
:
came
forth
and
delivered
up
his
sword
and
his
cimeter
,
and
his
:
bow
into
the
hands
-
of
Moroni
,
and
said'
unto
him
,
behold
,
'
here
:
are
Our
weapons
:
of
war
;
we
will
deliver
them
up
:
unto
[File:364]
you
,
and
.
we
will
not
suffer
ourselves
to
take
an
oath
unto
you
,
which
we
know
that
we
shall
break
,
and
also
our
.
children
;
but
take
our
weapons
of
war
,
and
suffer
that
we
may
depart
into
the
wilderness
;
otherwise
we
will
retain
:
our
swords
,
and
we
will
perish
or
conquer
.
Behold
,
we
are
not
of
your
faith
;
we
do
not
believe
that
it
is
God
that
has
:
delivered
.
us
.
into
your
hands
;
but
we
believe
that
it
is
your
cunning
that
has
preserved
you
from
our
swords
..
Behold
,
it
is
your
breast
-
plates
,
and
your
shields
that
has
preserved
:
you
.
And
now
when
Zerahemnah
had
made
an
end
of
speaking
these
words
,
Moroni
returned
the
sword
,
and
the
weapons
of
war
which
he
had
received
,
unto
Zerahemnah
,
saying
,
behold
,
we
will
end
the
conflict
.
Now
IJ
cannot
retain
the
words
which
I
have
spoken
;
therefore
,
as
the
Lord
liveth
,
ye
shall
not
depart
,
except
ye
depart
with
an
oath
,
that
ye
will
not
return
again
against
us
to
war
.
Now
as
ye
are
in
our
hands
,
we
will
spill
your
blood
upon
the
ground
,
or
ye
shall
submit
tothe
conditions
to
which
I
have
proposed
..
And
now
.
when
Moroni
had
said
these
words
,
Zerahemnah
retained
his
sword
,
and
he
was
angry
with
.
Moroni
,
and
he
rushed
forward
that
he
might
slay
Moroni
;
.
but
as
he
raised
his
sword
,
behold
,
one
of
Moroni's
soldiers
smote
it
even
to
the
earth
;
and
:
it
broke
.
by
the
hilt
;
and
he
also
smote
Zerahemnah
,
that
he
took
off
his
scalp
,
and
it
fell
to
the
earth
..-
And
Zerahemnah
withdrew
from
before
them
,
into
.
the
:
midst
of
his
soldiers
.
.
And
it
came
to
.
pass
that
the
solldier
who
stood
by
,
who
smote
off
the
scalp
of
Zerahemnah
,
took
up
the
scalp
from
off
the
ground
,
by
the
hair
,
and
.
laid
it
upon
the
point
of
-
his
:
sword
,
and
stretched
it
forth
unto
them
,
saying
unto
them
with
a
loud
voice
,
even
as
this
scalp
.
has
fallen
-
to
-
the
earth
,
which
is
the
scalp
of
your
chief
,
so
shall
ye
fall
to
the
earth
,
except
ye
will
deliver
.
up
your
weapons
of
war
,
and
depart
,
with
a
covenant
of
peace
...
:
Now
there
were
many
,
when
they
heard
.
these
words
,
and
saw
the
scalp
which
was
upon
the
.
sword
,
that
were
struck
with
fear
,
and
many
,
came'fortb
and
threw
down
their
weapons
of

,
at
the
feet
.
of
Moroni
,
and
entered
into

soldiers
to
anger
,
to
contend
more
powerfully
against
the
Nephites
.
And
now
Moroni
was
angry
,
because
of
the
stubbornness
of
the
Lamanites
;
therefore
he
commanded
his
people
that
they
should
fall
upon
them
and
slay
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
began
toslay
them
;
yea
,
and
the
Lamanites
did
contend
with
their
swords
.
and
theirmights
.
But
.
behold
,
their
naked
skins
,
and
their
bare
heads
,
were
exposed
to
the
sharp
swords
of
the
Nephites
;
yea
,
behold
,
they
were
pierced
and
smitten
;
yea
,
and
did
fall
exceeding
fast
before
the'swords
of
the
Nephites
;.
and
they
began
to
be
swept
down
,
even
as
the
soldier
of
Moroni
had
prophesied
.
Now
Zerahemnah
,
when
he
saw
that
they
were
all
about
to
be
destroyed
,
cried
mightily
unto
.
Moroni
,
promising
that
he
would
covenant
,
and
also
his
people
,
with
them
,
if
they
would
spare
the
remainder
of
their
lives
,
that
they
never
would
come
to
war
again
against
them
.
And
it
.
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
caused
that
the
work
of
death
should
cease
again
among
the
people
.
And
he
took
the
weapons
of
war
from
the
Lamanites
;
and
afler
they
had
entered
into
a
covenant
with
him
of
peace
,
they
were
suffered
to
depart
into
the
wilderness
.
Now
.
the
number
of
their
dead
were
not
numbered
,
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
number
;
yea
,
the
number
of
their
dead
were
exceeding
great
,
both
on
the
Nephites
,,
and
on
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
cast
their
dead
into
the
waters
of
Sidon
;
and
they
have
gone
forth
,
and
are
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
.
And
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
,
or
of
Moroni
,
returned
,
and
came
to
their
houses
,
and
their
lands
.
.
And
thus
ended
the
eighteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
thus
ended
the
record
of
Alma
,
which
was
wrote
upon
the
plates
of
Nephi
.
[File:366]
CHAPTER
XXI
.
The
account
of
the
people
of
Nephi
,
and
their
wars
and
dissensions
,
in
the
duys
of
Helaman
,
according
.
to
the
record
of
Helaman
,
which
he
kept
in
his
days
.
Brworp
,
now
it
came
.
to
pass
that
the
people
of
Nephi
were
exceedingly
rejoiced
,
because
.
the
Lord
had
again
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
;
therefore
they
gave
thanks
unto
the
Lord
their
God
;
yea
,
and
they
did
fast
much
and
pray
much
,
and
they
did
worship
God
with
exceeding
great
joy
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
nineteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
that
Alma
came
unto
his
son
Helaman
,
and
said
unto
-
hin
,
believest
thou
the
words
which
I
spake
unto
thee
concerning
those
records
which
have
been
kept
?)
And
Helaman
said
unto
him
,
yea
,
I
believe
.
And
Alma
said
again
,
believest
thou
in
Jesus
Christ
,
who
shall
come
?
And
he
said
,
yea
,
I
believe
all
the
words
which
thou
hast
spoken
.
And
Alma
said
unto
him
again
,
will
ye
keep
my
commandments
?
And
he
said
,
yea
,
I
will
keep
thy
commandments
with
all
my
heart
.
Then
Alma
said
unto
him
,
blessed'
art
thou
;
and
the
Lord
shall
prosper
thee
in'thisJand
.
But
behold
,
[
have
somewhat
to
prophesy
.
unto
thee
;
but
what
I
prophesy
unto
thee
,
ye
shall
not
make
known
;
yea
,
what
I
prophesy
nnto
thee
shall
not
be
made
known
,
even
until
the
prophecy
is
fulfilled
;
therefore
write
the
words
which
I
shall
say
.
And
these
are
the
words
:
Behold
,
[
-
preceive
that
this
very
people
,
the
Nephites
,
according
to
the
spirit
of
revelation
which
isin
me
,
in
four
htundred
years
from
the
time
that
Jesus
Christ
-
shall
manifest
himself
unto
them
,
shall
dwindle
in
unbelief
;
yea
,
and
then
shall
they
see
wars
and
pestilences
,
yea
,
famines
and
bloodshed
,
even
until
the
people
of
Nephi
shall
become
extinct
;
yea
,
and
this
because
they
shall
dwindle
in
unbelief
,
and
fall
into
the
works
of
darkness
and
lasciviousness
,
and
all
manner
of
iniquities
;
yea
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
because
they
shall
sin
against
so
great
light
and
knowledge
;
yea
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
from
that
day
,
even
the
fourth
generation
shall
not
all
pass
away
,
before
this
great
miquity
shall
come
;
and
when
that
great
day
cometh
,
behold
,
the
time
very
soon
cometh
that
those
who
.
are
now
,
or
the
seed
of
those
who
are
now
numbered
among
the
people
of
Nephi
,
shall
no
[File:367]
more
be
numbered
among
the
people
of
Nephi
;.
but
whosoever
remaineth
,
and
is
:
not
destroyed
in
that
great
and
dreadful
day
,
shall
be
-
numbered
among
the
Lamanites
,
and'shall
become
like
unto
them
,
all
,
save
.
it
bea
few
,
who
shall
be
called
the
disciples
of
the
Lord
;
and
them
shall
the
Lamanites
pursue
,
even
until
they
shall
become'
extinct
.
And
now
,
because
of
iniquity
,
this
prophecy
shall
be
fulfilled
.
And
now
itcame
to
pass
that
after
Alma
had
said
these
things
to
Helaman
,
he
biessed
him
,
and
also
his
other
sons
;
and
he
also
blessed
the
earth
,
for
the
righteous'
sake
.
And
he
said
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
God
:
Cursed
shall
be
the
land
,
yea
,
this
land
,
unto
every
nation
,
kindred
,
tongue
,
and
people
,
unto
destruction
,
which
do
wickedly
,
when
they
are
fully
ripe
;
and
as
I
have
said
,
so
shall
it
be
:
for
this
is
the
cursing
and
the
blessing
of
God
upon
the
land
,
for
the
Lord
cannot
look
.
upon
sin
with
the
least
degree
of
allowance
.
And
now
,
when
Alma
had
said
these
words
,
he
blessed
the
church
,
yea
,
all
those
who
should
stand
fast
in
the
faith
,
from
.
that
time
henceforth
;
and
.
when
Alma
had
done
this
,
he
departed
out
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
as
if
to
go
into
the
land
of
Melek
.
gAnd
it
came
to
pass
that
he
was
never
heard
of
more
;
as
to
-
his
death
or
burial
,
we
know
not
of
.
.
Behold
,
this
we
know
,
that
he
was
a
righteous
man
;
and
the
saying
went
abroad
in
the
church
,
that
he
was
taken
up
by
the
spirit
,
or
buried
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
even
as
Moses
...
But
behold
,
the
scripture
saith
the
Lord
took
Moses
unto
himself
;
and
we
suppose
that
he
has
also
received
Alma
,
in
the
spirit
,
unto
himself
;
therefore
,
for
this
cause
,
we
know
nothing
concerning
his
death
and
burial
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
nineteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
Ser
the
people
of
Nephi
,
that
Helaman
went
forth
among
the
people
to
.
declare
.
the
word
unto
them
;
for
behold
,
because
oftheir
wars
with
the
Lamanites
,
and
the
many
.
little
:
dissensions
and
disturbances
which
had
been
among'
the
people
,
it
became
expedient
that
the
word
of
God
:
should
.
be
declared
among
them
;
yea
,
and
that
aregulation
-
should
be
made
throughout
:
the
church
;
therefore
Helaman
and
his
brethren
went
forth
to
establish
.
the
church
.
again
in
all
the
:
land
,
yea
,
in
every
city
,
throughout
all
-
the
land
which
was
possessed
:
by
.
the
:
people
of
,
Nephi
...
And
:
it
came
to
pass
:
that
:
they
.
[File:368]
did
appoint
priests
and
teachers
throughout
all
the
land
,
over
all
the
churches
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Helaman
and
his
brethren
had
appointed
priests
and
.
teachers
over
the
churches
,
that
there
arose
a
dissention
among
them
,
and
they
.
would
not
give
heed
to
the'
words
of
Helaman
and
his
brethren
;
but
they
grew
proud
,
being
lifted
up
in
their
hearts
,
because
of
their
exceeding
great
riches
;
therefore
they
grew
rich
in
their
own
eyes
,
and
would
not
give
heed
to
their
words
,
to
walk
uprightly
before
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
.
as
many
as
would
not
hearken
to
the
words
of
Helaman
and
his
brethren
,
were
gathered
together
against
their
brethren
.
And
now
behold
,
they
were
exceeding
wroth
,
insomuch
that
they
were
determined
to
slay
them
.
Now
:
the
leader
of
those
who
were
wroth
against
their
brethren
,
was
a
large
and
a
strong
man
;
and
his
name
was
Amalickiah
.
And
Amalickiah
was
desirous
to
be
a
king
;
and
-
those
people
who
were
wroth
,
were
also
desirous
that
he
should
be
their
king
;
and
they
were
the
greater
part
of
them
the
lower
judges
of
the
land
;
and
they
were
seekigg
for
power
.
And
they
had
been
led
by
the
flatteries
of
Amalickiah
,
that
if
they
would
support
him
,
and
establish
him
to
be
their
king
,
that
he
would
make
them
rulers
over
the
people
.
Thus
they
were
led
away
by
Amalickiah
,
to
dissensions
,
notwsthstanding
the
preaching
of
Helaman
and
his
brethren
;
yea
,
notwithstanding
their
exceeding'
great
care
over
the
church
,
for
they
were
high
priests
over
the
church
.
And
there
were
many
in
the
church
who
believed
in
the
flattering
words
of
Amalickiah
;
therefore
they
dissented
even
from
the
church
;
and
thus
were
the
affairs
of
the
people
of
Nephi
exceeding
precarious#and
dangerous
,
notwithstanding
their
great
victory
which
they
had
had
over
the
Lamanites
,
and
their
great
rejoicings
which
they
had
-
had
,
because
of
their
deliverance
by
the
hands
of
the
Lord
.
Thus
we
see
how
quick
the
children
of
men
do
forget
the
Lord
their
God
;
yea
,
how
quick
to
do
iniquity
,
and
to
be
led
away
by
the
evil
one
;
yea
,
and
we
also
see
the
great
wickedness
one
very
wicked
man
can
cause
to
take
place
among
the
children
of
men
;
yea
,
we
see
that
Amalickiah
,
because
:
he
was
a
man
of
cunning
devices
,
and
aman
of
:
many
-
flattering
words
,
that
he
led'away
the
hearts
:
of
many
:
people
to
do
wickedly
;
yea
,
and
to'seek
to
destroy
the
church
of
God
,
and
to
[File:369]
destroy
.
the
foundation
of
liberty
which
God
had
granted
unto
them
,
or
which
blessing
.
God
.
had
sent
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
for
the
righteous'
sake
.
a
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
;
Moroni
,
wh
was
.
the
chief
.
commander
of
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
,
bad
heard
of
these
-
dissensions
,
he
was
angry
with
Amalickiah
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
rent
his
coat
;
and
.
he
took
a
piece
thereof
,
and
wrote
upon
it
,
ia
memory
of
our
God
,
our
religion
,
and
freedom
,
and
our
peace
,
our
wives
,
and
our
children
;
and'
he
fastened
it
upon
the
end
of
a
pole
thereof
.
And
he
fastened
on
his
head
-
plate
,
and
his
breast
-
plate
,
and
his
shields
,
and
girded
on
his
armour
about
his
loins
;
and
he
took
the
pole
,
which
had
on
the
end
thereof
his
rent
coat
,
(
and
he'called
it
the
title
of
liberty
,)
and
he
bowed
himself
to
the
earth
,
and
he
prayed
mightily
unto
his
God
for
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
rest
upon
his
brethren
so
long
as
there
should
a
band
of
christians
remain
to
possess
the
land
:
for
thus
were
all
the
true
believers
of
Christ
,
who
belonged
to
the
church
of
God
,
called
,
by
those
who
did
not
belong
to
the
church
;
and
those
who
did
belong
to
the
church
,
were
faithful
;
yea
,
all
those
who
were
true
believers
in
.
Christ
,
took
upon
them
,
gladly
,
the
name
of
Christ
,
or
-
christians
,
as
they
were
called
,
because
of
their
belief
in
Christ
,
who
should
come
;
and
therefore
,
at
this
:
time
,
Moroni
prayed
that
the
cause
of
the
christlans
,
and
the
freedom
of
the
land
might
be
favored
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
poured
out
his
:
soul
to
God
,
he
gave
all
the
Jand
which
was
south
ofthe
land
Desolation
;
yea
,
and
in
fine
,
all
the
land
,
both
on
the
north
-
and
on
the
south
,
a
chosen
land
,
and
the
land
of
liberty
.
And
he
,
said
,
surely
.:
God
shall
not
suffer
that
we
,
who
are
despised
becatise
we
:
take
upon
us
-
the
name
of
Christ
,
shall
be
trodden
.
down
-
and
destroyed
,
until
we
bring
it
upon
us
,
by
our
Own
transgressions
.
And
when
Moroni
had
.
said
these
words
,
he
went
.
forth
among
the
people
,.
waying
the
rent
of
his
garment
in
the
air
,
that
all
might
see
the
writin
which
he
-
had
wrote
upon
..
the
:
rent
,
and
crying
-
with
:
a
.
loud
-
yoice
,
saying
,
behold
,
whosoever
Will
maintain
this

title
upon

the
land
,
'
let
them
come
:
forth
.
in
.
the
strength
.
of
the
Lord
,
and
-
enter
:
into
-
a
Sovenant
:
that
..
they
:
will
maintain
,
their
rights
,
and
.
their'religion
;
that
the
.
Lord
God
may
bless
:
thems

}
.,
And
itcame
,
to
pass
that
when
Moroni
had
-
proclaimed
these
words
,
behold
,
the
people
came
running
to
[File:370]
gether
,
with
their
armors
:
girded
:
about
their
loins
,
rending
their
gatmentsin
token
,
or
as
a
covenant
,
that
they
would
not
forsake
the
Lord
:
their
God
;
or
,.
in
other
words
,
if
they
should
transgress
the
commandments
of
God
,
or
fall
into
transgression
,
and
be
ashamed
to
:
take
upon
them
the
name
of
Christ
,
the
Lord
should
rend
them
even
as
they
had
rent
their
garments
.
Now
this
was'
the
coyenant
which
they
made
;
and
they
cast
their
garments
at
the
feet
of
Moroni
,
stying
,
we
covenant
with
our
God
,
that
we
shall
be
destroyed
,
even
as
our
brethren
in
the
land
northward
,
ifwe
shall
fallinto
transgression
;
yea
,
he
may
cast
us
at
the
feet
of
our
enemies
,
even
as
we
have
cast
our
garments
at
thy
feet
,
to
be
trodden
under
foot
,
if
we
shall
.
fall
into
transgression
.
Moroni
said
unto
them
,
behold
,
we
are
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
Jacob
;
yea
,
we
are
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
Joseph
,
whose
coat
was'rent
by
his
brethren
,
into
many
pieces
;
yea
,
and
now
behold
,
let
us
remember
to
keep
the
commandments'of
God
,
or
our
garments
shall
be
rent
by
our
brethren
,
and
we
.
be
cast
into
prison
,
or
be
sold
,
or
be
slain
;
yea
,
let
us
preserve
our
liberty
,
as
a
remnant
of
Joseph
:
yea
,
let
ug
-
rememember
the
words
of
Jacob
,
before
his
death
;
for
behold
,
he
saw
that
a
part
of
the
remnant
of
-
the
coat
of
Joseph
was
preserved
,
and
had
not
deeayed
.
And
he
said
,
even
as
this
remnant
of
garment
of
my
sons
hath
been
preserved
,
89
shall
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
my
sons
be
preserved
by
the
hand
of
God
,
and
ba
taken
unto
himself
,
while
the
remainder
of
the
seed
of
Joseph
shall
perish
,
even
as
the
remmant
of
his
garment
.
Now
behold
,
tiis
.
giveth
my
soul
sorrow
:
nevertheless
,
my
soul
:
hath
joy
in
mY
son
,
because
that
part
of
his
seed
which
shall
be
taken
unto
God
.
Now
behold
,
this
wags
the
language
of
Jacob
.
And
now
who
knoweth
but
what
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
Joseph
,
which
shall
perish
as
his
garment
,
are
those
who
have
dissented
from
us
;
yea
,
and
even
it'shall
be
us
,
if
we
do
not
stand
fast
in
the
faith
of
Christ
.
:
:
And
now
it
cam
?
to
pass
that
when
Moroni
had
said
these
words
,
he
went
forth
,
and
also
sent
forth
:
in
all
the
parts
:
of
the
land
where
there
were
dissensions
,
and
gathered
together
all
the
people
who
were
desirous
to
maintain
their
liberty
,
to
stand
against
Aimalickiah
,
and
those
who
liad
:
dissented
,
who
were
called
-
Amalickiahites

And
it
came
to
pass
that
:
when
Amalickiah
saw
that
the
people
of
Moroni
were
more
-
numerous
than
the
Amalickiahites
;
and
he
also
saw
that
his
people
were
doubtful
concerning
the
justice
of
the
cause
in
which
they
had
undertaken
;
therefore
,
fearing
that
he
should
not
gain
.
the
point
,
he'
took
those
of
his
people
who
would
,
anddeparted
into
:
the
land
of
Nephi
.
Now
Moroni
thought
it
was
not
expedient
that
the
Lamanites'should
have
any
more
strength
;
therefore
he
thought
to
cut
off
the
people
of
Amalickiah
,
or
to
take
them
-
and
bring
them
back
,
and
put
Amalickiah
to
death
;
yea
,
for
he
knew
that
they
would
stir
up
the
Lamanites
to
anger
against
them
,
and
cause
them
to
come
t6
battle
against
them
;
and
this
he'knew
that
Amalickiah
would
do
,
that
he
might
.
obtain
his
purposes
;
therefore
Moroni
thought
it
was
expedient
that
he
should
take
his
armies
,
who
had
gathered
themselves
together
,
and
armed
themselves
,
and
entered
into
acovenant
to
keep
the
peace
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
took
his
army
,
and
marched
:
out
into
the
wilderness
,
to
cut
off
the
course
of
Amalickiah
in
the
wilderness
.
And
-
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
according
to
his
desires
,
and
marched
forth
into
the
wilderness
,
and
headed
the
armies
of
Amalickiah
.
Ard
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
fled
with
a
small
number
of
his
men
,
and
the
remainder
were
delivered
up
into
the
hands
of
Moroni
,
and
-
were
taken
.
back
into
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
Now
Moroni
being
a
:
man
-
who
was
appointed
by
the
chief
judges
and
the
voice
of
the
people
therefore
he
had
power
according
to
his
will
,
with
the
armiesof
the
Nephites
,
to
establish
and'to
exercise
authority
over
them
.
8
And
it
came
to
pass
that
whomsoever
of
the
Amalickiahites
that
would
not
enter
into
a
convenant
to
support
the
cause
of
freedom
,
that
they
might
maintain
a
free
government
,
he
caused
1o
be
put
to
death
;
and
there
was
but
few
who
denied
the
covenant
of
freedom
.
And
it
came
to
pass
also
,
that
he
caused
the
title
of
liberty
to
be
hoisted
upon
every
tower
which
was
in
all'the
land
,
which
was
possessed
by
the
.
Nephites
;
and
thus
Moroni
planted
the
standard
of
liberty
among
the
Nephites
.
And
they
began
to
have
peace
again
in
the
land
;
and
thus
they
did
maintain'
peace
in
the
land
,
until
nearly
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
:
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
And
Helaman
and
the
[File:372]
high
priests
did
.
also
.
maintain
order
in
.
the
church
;
yea
,
even
for
the
space
of
-
four
years
,
did
they
have
much
peace
and
rejoicing
inthe
church
.
And
it
came
.
to
pass
that
there
were
many
who
died
,
firmly
believing
that
their
souls
were
redeemed
by
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
;
thus
they
went
out
of
the
world
rejoicing
.
And
there
were
some
who
died
with
fevers
,
which
at
some
seasons
of
the
year
,
was
.
very
frequent
in
the
land
;
but
not
so
much
so
with
fevers
,
because
of
the
excellent
qualities
of
the
many
plants
and
roots
which
God
had
prepared
,
to
remove
the
cause
of
diseases'to
which
men
was
subject
,
by
the
nature
of
the
climate
.
But
there
were
many
who
died
with
old
age
;
and
those
who
died
in
the
faith
of
Christ
,
are
happy
in
him
,
as
we
must
needs
suppose
.
Now
we
will
return
in
our
record
,
to
Amalickiah
,
and
those
who
had
fled
with
him
into
the
wilderness
:
for
behold
,
he
had
taken
those
who
.
went
with
him
,
and
went
up
in
the
land
of
Nephi
,
among
the
Lamanites
,
and
did
stir
up
the
Lamanites
to
anger
,
against
the
people
of
Nephi
,
insomuch
that
the
king
ot
the
Lamanites
sent
a
proclamation
throughout
all
his
land
,
among
all
his
people
,
that
.
they
should
gather
themselves
together
again
,
to
go
to
battle
against
the
Nephites
.
And
it
.
came
to
pass
.
that
when
.
the
.
proclamation
had
gone
.
forth
among
them
,
they
were
exceeding
fraid
;
yea
,
they
feared
to
displease
the
king
,
and
they
also
feared
to
go
to
battle
against
the
Nephites
,
lest
they
should
lose
their
lives
,,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
would
not
,
or
the
more
part
of
them
would
not
obey
the
commandments
.
of
the
king
.
And
now
it
.
came
to
pass
that
.
the
king
was
wroth
,
because
of
their
disobedience
;
therefore
he
gave
Amalickiah
the
command
of
-
that
part
of
his
army
which
was'obedient
unto
.
his
commands
,
and
commanded
him
that
he
should
.
go
:
forth
and
compel
them
to
arms
.
Now
:
behold
,
this
was
the
desire
of
Amalcikiah
:,
for
he
being
.
a
very
subtle
man
to
do
,
evil
,
therefore
he
laid
the
plan
in
his
heart
to
dethrone
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
...
And
.
now
-
he
had
got
the
command
of
those
parts
ofthe
Lamanites
.
who
.
were
in
-
favor
of
the
-
king
:
and
-
he
;
soughtito
gain
favorof
those
who
were
.
not
obedient
;
therefore
.
he
,
went
forward
,
to
the
.
place
which
,
wag
-
called
Onidah
,
for
thither
.
had
all
the
Lamanites
fied
;:
forsthey
discovered
the
army
;
coming
,
and
supposing
:
thatithey
were
,
comingto
destroy
:
them
,
therefore
they
fled
..
te
;
Onidah
,
tothe
place
of
arms
.
And
[File:373]
they
had
appointed
a
man
to
be
a
king
and
a
leader
over
them
,
being
fixed
in
their
minds
.
with
a
determin
-.
ed
resolution
that
.
they
would
not
:
be
subjected
to
-
go
against
the
Nephites
.
~
Le
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
had
gathered
thems
selyes
together
upon
top
of
the
mount
which
was
called
Antipas
,
in
preparation
to
battle
.
Now
it
was
not
Amalickiah's
intention
to
give
them
battle
,
according
to
the
commandments
of
the
king
;
but
behold
,
it
was
his
intention
to
gain
favor
with
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
he
might'place
himself
at
their
head
,
and
dethrone
the
king
,
and
take
possession
of
the
kingdom
.
And
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
he
caused
his
army
to
pitch
their
tents
in
the
valley
which
was
near
the
mount
Antipas
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
it
was
night
,
he
sent
a
secret
embassy
into
the
mount
Antipas
,
desiring
that
the
leader
of
those
who
were
upon
the
mount
,
whose
name
was
Lehonti
,
that
he
should
come
down
to
the
foot
of
the
mount
,
for
he
desired
(
o
speak
with
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Lehonti
received
the
message
,
he
durst
not
go
down
to
the
foot
of
the
mount
.
And
it
cameto
pass
that
Amalickhiah
sent
again
the
second
time
,
desiring
him
to
come
down
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Lehonti
would
not
;
and
he
sent
again
the
third
time
.
And
itcame
to
pass
that
when
Amalickiah
found
that
he
could'
not
get
Lehonti
to
come
down
off
from
the
mount
,
he
went
up
into
the
mount
,
nearly
.
to
Lehonti's
camp
;
and
he
sent
again
the
fourth
time
,
his
message
unto
Lehonti
,
desiring
that
he
would
sen
down
,
and
that
he
would
bring
his
guards
with
im
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Lehonti
had
come
down
with
his
guards
to
Amalickiah
,
that
Amalickiah
desired
him
to
come
down
with
his
ariny
in
the
night
time
,
and
surround
those
men
in
their
camps
,
over
whom
the
king
had
gave
him
command
,
and
that
he
would
deliver
them
up
into
Lehonti's
hands
,
if
he
:
would
make
him
,
(
Amalickiah
,)
a
second
leader
over
the
whole
army
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Lehonti
came
down
with
his
men
,
and
surrounded
the
men
of
Amalickiah
,.
so
tliat
before
they
awoke
at
.
the
dawn
of
the
day
,
they
were
surrounded
by
the
armies
of
Lehonti
,
_Andvit
came
topass
that
when
they
saw
that
:
they
were
surrounded
,
they
plead'
with
:
Amalickiah
:
that
he
:
would
suffer'them
to
fall
in
with
their
brethren
,
that
they
:
[File:374]
might
not
.
be
destroyed
.
Now
this
was
.
the
very
thing
which
Amalickiah
desired
.
And
it
came
to
pass
,
that
he
delivered
his
men
,
contrary
to
the
commands
of
the
king
.
Now
this
was
the
thing
that
Amalickiah
desired
,
that
he
might
accomplish
his
designs
in
dethroning
the
king
.
Now
it
was
the
custom
among
the
Lamanites
,
if
their
chief
leader
was
killed
,
to
appoint
the
second
leader
to
be
their
chief
leader
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
caused
that
one
of
his
servants
should
administer
poison
,
by
degrees
to
Lehonti
,
that
he
died
.
Now
when
Lehonti
was
dead
,
the
Lamanites
appointed
.
Amalickiah
to
be
their
leader
and
their
,
chief
commander
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
marched
with
his
armies
(
for
he
had
gained
his
desires
)
to
the
land
of
Nephi
,
to
the
city
of
Nephi
,
which
was
the
chief
city
.
And
the
king
came
out
to
meet
him
,
with
his
guards
:
for
he
supposed
that
Amalickiah
had
fulfilled
his
commands
,
and
that
Amalickiah
had
gathered
together
so
great
an
army
to
go
against
the
Nephites
to
battle
.
But
behold
,
as
the
king
came
out
to
meet
him
,
Amaliekiah
caused
that
his
servants
should
go
forth
te
meet
the
king
.
And
they
went
and
bowed
themselves
before
the
king
,
as
if
to
reverence
.
him
,
because
.
of
his
greatness
,
And
it
came
to
pass
thatthe
king
:
put
forth
his
hand
to
raise
them
,
as
was
the
custom
with
the
Lamanites
,
as
a
token
of
peace
,
which
custom
.
they
had
taken
from
the
Nephites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
raised
the
first
from
the
ground
,
behold
he
stabbed
the
king
to
the
heart
;
and
.
he
fell
to
the
earth
.
Now
the
servants
of
the
king
fled
;
and
the
servants
of
Amalickiah
raised
a
ery
,
saying
,
behold
,
the
servants
of
the
king
have
,
stabbed
him
to
the
heart
,
and
he
has
fell
,
and
they
have
.
fled
;
behold
,
come
and
see
.
And
it
.
came
to
:
pass
.
that
Amalickiah
.
commanded
that
his'armies
should
march
forth
,
and
.
see
what
had
happened
tothe
king
;
and
when
they
had
come
to
-
the
spot
,
and
found
:
the
king
liying
in
his
.
gore
,
Amalic
kiah
pretended
to
be
wroth
,
and
said
whosoever
loved
the
king
;
let
him
go
forth
and
pursue
his
servants
,
that
they
may'be
slain
.
:
;
And
-
it
.
came'
to
,
pass
that
when'all
.
they
who
loved
the
king
,
when'they
heard
these
words
,
came
forth
.
and
pursued
after
the
servants
of
the
king
...
Now
when
the
servants
of
the
king
saw
.
an
.
army
pursuing
.
after
them
,
they
were
frighted
again
,
and
:
fled
into
the
wilderness
,
[File:375]
and
came
over
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
joined
the
people
of
Ammon
;
end
the
army
which
pursued
after
them
,
returned
,
having
pursued
afler
them
in
vain
:
and
thus
Amalickiah
,
by
his
fraud
,
gained
the
hearts
of
the
people
:
And
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
,
he
entered
the
city
Nephi
,
with
his
armies
,
and
took
possession
of
the
city
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
the
queen
,
when
she
had
heard
that
the
king
was
slain
:
for
Amalickiah
had
sent
an
embassy
to
the
queen
,
informing
her
that
the
king
had
been
slain
by
his
servants
;
that
he
had
pursued
them
with
his
army
,
but
it
was
in
vain
,
and
they
had
made
their
escape
,
therefore
when
the
queen
had
received
this
message
,
she
sent
unto
Amalickiah
,
desiring
him
that
he
would
spare
the
people
of
the
city
;
and
she
aiso
desired
him
that
he
should
come
in
unto
her
;
and
she
also
desired
him
that
he
should
bring
witnesses
with
him
,
to
testify
concerning
the
death
of
the
king
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
took
the
same
servant
that
slew
the
king
,
and
all
they
who
were
with
him
,
and
went
in
unto
the
queen
,
unto
the
place
where
she
sat
;
and
they'all
testified
unto
her
that
the
king
was
slain
by
his
own
servants
;
and
they
said
,
also
,
they
have
fled
;
does
not
this
testify
against
them
?
And
thus
they
satisfied
the
queen
concerning
the
death
of
the
king
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
sought
the
favor
of
the
queen
,
and
took
her
unto
him
to
wife
;
and
thus
by
his
fraud
,
and
by
the
assistance
of
his
cunning
servants
,
he
obtained
the
kingdom
:
yea
,
he
was
acknowledged
king
throughout
all
the
land
,
among
all
the
people
of
the
Lamanites
,
who
were
composed
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
the
Lemiuelites
,
and
the
-
]shmaelites
,
and
all
the
dissenters
of
the
Nephites
,
from
the
reign
of
Nephi
down
to
the
present
time
.
Now
these
dissenters
,
having
the
same
instruction
and
the
same
information
of
the
Neephites
;
yea
,
having
been
instrueted
in
the
sathe
knowledge
of
the
Lord
;
nevertheless
;
it
is
strange
to
relate
,
not
long
after
their
dissensions
,
they
became
more
hardened
and
impenitent
,
and
more
wild
,
wicked
and
ferocious
,
thas
the
Lamanites
;
drinking
in
with
the
traditions
of
the
Lamanites
;
giving
way
to
indolence
,
and
all
manner
of
lascivioushess
;
yeas
entirely
forgetting
the
Lord
their
God
.

[File:376]
And
:
now
it
came
to
pass
that
.
as
soon
as
Amalickiah
had
obtained
the
,
kingdom
,
he
began
to
inspire
the
hearts
.
of
the
Lamanites
.
against
the
.
people
of
Nephi
;
yea
,
he
did
appoint
men
to
,
speak
unto
the
Lamanites
from
their
towers
,
against
the
Nephites
;
and
thus
he
did
inspire
their
hearts
.
against
,
the
Nephites
,
insomuch
,
that
in
the
latter
end
of
the
nineteeth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
he
having
accomplished
his
designs
thus
far
;,
yea
,
having
been
made
king
over
the
Lamanites
,
he
soughtalso
to
reign
over
all
the
land
;
yea
,
and
all
the
people
who
.
were
in
the
land
,
the
Nephites
as
well
as
the
Lamanites
,
therefore
he
had
accomplished
his
design
,
for
he
.
had
hardened
the
hearts
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
.
blinded
their
winds
,
and
stirred
them
up
to
anger
,
insomuch
that
he
had
gathered
togethera
numerous
host
,
to
go
to
battle
against
the
Nephites
.
For
he
was
determined
,
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
number
or
his
people
,
to
overpower
the
Nevhites
,
and
to
bring
them
into
bondage
;
and
thus
he
did
appoint
chief
captains
of
the
Zoramites
,
they
being
the
most
acquainted
with
the
strength
of
the
Nephites
,
and
their
places
of
regort
,
and
the
weakest
parts
of
their
cities
;
therefore
.
he
appointed
them
to
be
chief
captains
over
his
armies
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
took
their
camp
,
and
moved
forth
towards
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
in
the
wilderness
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
while
Amalickiah
had
thas
been
obtaining
power
by
fraud
and
deceit
,
Moroni
,
on
the
other
hand
,
had
been
preparing
the
minds
of
the
people
to
be
faithful
unto
the
Lord
their
God
;
yea
,
he
had
.
been
strengthening
the
arnues
of
the
Nephites
,
and
erecting
small
forts
,
or
places
of
resort
;
throwing
up
banks
of
earth
round
about
,
to
enclose
his
.
armies
,
and
also
building
walls
of
stone
to
encircle
them
about
,
round
about
their
cities
,
and
the
borders
of
their
lands
;
yea
,
all
round
about
the
land
;
and
in
their
weakest
fortifications
,
he
did
place
the
greater
number
of
men
;
and
thus
he
did
fortify
and
strengthen
the
land
which
was
possessed
by
the
Nephites
.
And
thus
he
was
.
preparing
to
support
their
liberty
,
their
lands
,
their
wives
,
and
their
children
,
and
their
peace
,
and
that
they
might
live
unto
the
Lord
their
God
,
and
that
they
might
maintain
that
which
was
called
by
tueir
enemies
the
cause
of
christians
.
And
Moroni
was
.
a
strong
anda
mighty
man
;
he
was
a
man
ofa
perfect
understanding
;
yea
,
aman
that
did
not
delight
in
bloodshed
;
a
man
iho
soul
did
joy
in
[File:377]
the
:
liberty
and
the
freedom
of
his
country
,
and
-
higs
brethren
frombondage
and
slavery
;
yea
,
aman
whose
heart
did
swell
with
thanksgiving
to
his
God
,
for
-
the
many
privileges
and
blessings
which
he
bestowed
upon
his
people
;
a
man
who
did
labor
exceedingly
for
the
welfare
and
safety
of
his
people
;
yea
,
and
he
was
a
man
who
was
firm
in
the
faith
of
Christ
,
and
:
be
had
sworn
with
an
oath
,
to
defend
his
people
,
his
rights
;:
and
his
country
,
and
his
religion
,
even
to
.
the
loss
of
his
blood
.
Now
the
Nephites
were
taught
to
defend
themselves
against
their
enemies
,
even
to
the
shedding
of
blood
,
if
it
were
necessary
;
yea
,
and
they
were
also
taught
never
to
give
an
offence
;
yea
;
and
never
to
taise
the
sword
,
except
it
were
against
an
enemy
,
except
-
it
were
to
preserve
their
lives
:
and
this
was
their
faith
,
that
-
by
so
doing
,
God
would
prosper
them
in
the
land
;
or
in
other
words
,
if
they
were
faithful
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
God
,
that
he
would
prosper
them
in
the
land
;
yea
,
warn
them
to
flee
,
or
to
prepare
for
war
,
according
to
their
danger
;
andalso
,
that
God
would
make
it
known
-
unto
them
,
whither
they
should
go
to
defend
themselves
against
.
their
enemies
;
and'by
so
doing
,
the
Lord
would
deliver
them
,
and
this
was
the
faith
of
Moroni
;
and
,
his
heart
did
glory
in
it
;
not
in
the
shedding
of
blood
,
but
in
doing
good
,
in
preserving
his
people
;
yea
,
in
keeping
the
commandments
of
God
;
yea
,
and
resisting
iniquity
.
Yea
,
verily
,
verily
I
say
unto
you
,
if
all
men
had
been
,
and
were
,
and
ever
would
be
,
like
unto
Moroni
,
behold
,
the
very
powers
of
hell
would
have
been
shaken
forever
;
yea
,
the
devil
would
never
.
have
.
power
over
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
men
.
Behold
,
he
-
was
aman
like
unto
Ammon
,
the
son
of
Mosiah
,
yea
,
and
even
the
other
sons
of
Mosiah
;
yea
,
and
-
also
Almaand
his
sons
,
for
they
were
all
men
of
God
.
Now
behold
,
Helaman
and
his
brethren
were
no
less
serviceable
unto
the
people
,
than
was
Moroni
;
for
they
did
preach
the
word
of
God
,
and
they
did
baptize
unto
repentance
,
all
men
whosoever
would
-
hearken
unto
their
words
.
And
thus
they
went
forth
,
and
the
people
did
humble
themselyes
because
of
their
words
,
insomuch
that
they
were
highly
favored
of
.
the
Lord
;
and
thus
they
were
free
from
wars
and
contentions
amhong
themselves
;
yea
,
even
forthe'space
of
.
four
.
years
,:
But
as
I
-
have
said
in
the
latter
end
of
the
nineteenth
;
yea
,
notwithstanding
theirypeace
amongst'
themselves
,
'
they
were
compelled
reluctantly
to
-
contend
with
:
their
-
brethren
;
the
[File:378]
Lamanites
;
yea
,
and
in
fine
,
their
ware
never
did
cease
for
the
space
of
many
.
years
with
the
Lamanites
,
notwithstanding
their
much
reluctance
.
Now
.
they
were
sorry
to
.
take
up
arms
against
the
Lamanites
,
becaus
they
did
not
delight
inthe
shedding
of
blood
;
yea
,
and
this
was
not
all
;
they
were
sorry
to
ba
the
means
of
sending
so
many
of
their
brethren
out
of
this
world
into
an
eternal
world'
unprepared
to
meet
their
God
;
nevertheless
,
they
could
not
suffer
to
lay
down
their
lives
,
that
their
wives
and
their
children
,
should
be
massacred
by
the
barbarous
cruelty
of
those
who
were
once
their
brethren
,
yea
,
and
-
had
dissented
from
their
church
,
and
:
had
left
them
,
and
had
gone
to
destroy
them
,
by
joining
the
Lamanites
;
-
yea
,
they
could
not
bear
that
their
brethren
should
rejoice
over
the
blood
of
the
Nephites
,
so
long
as
they
were
any
who
.
should
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
for
the
promise
of
the
Lord
was
,
if
they
should
keep
his
commandments
,
they
should
prosper
in
the
land
.
-
And
now
it
came
to
pass
,
in
the
eleventh
month
of
the
nineteenth
year
,
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
month
,
the
armies
of
the
:
Lamanites
:
were
seen
approaching
towards
the
land
.
of
-
Ammonihah
.
And
.
behold
,
the
city
had
been
-
re
-
built
,
and
Moroni
had
stationed
an
army
by
the
borders
of
the
city
.
and
they
had
cast
up
dirt
round
about
,
to
shield
them'
from
the
arrows
and
the
stones
of
the
Lamanites
;
forbehold
,
they
fought
with
stones
,
and
with
arrows
.
Behold
,
said
that
the
city
of
Ammonihah
had
been
re
-
built
.
[say
unto
you
,
yea
,
that
it
was
in
pert
re
-
built
,
and
because
the
Lamanites
had
destroyed
it
once
because
of
the
iniquity
of
the
people
,
they
supposed
-
that
it
would
again
become
-
an
easy
prey
for
them
.
But
behold
,
how
great
was
their
.
disappointment
:
for
behold
,
the
Nephites
had
dug
up
a
ridge
of
earth
round
about
them
,
which
was
so
high
that
the
Lamanites
could
not
cast
theit
stones
and
their
arrows
at
them
,
that
they
.
might
take
effect
,
neither
could
they
come
upon
them
,
save
it
was
by
their
place
of
entrance
.
Now
at
this
:
time
,
the
chief
captains
of
the
Lamanites
were
astonished
exceedingly
,
because
of
the
wisdom
of
the
Nephites
in
preparing
their
places
of
security
.
Now
the
leaders
of
the
Lamanites
had
supposed
,
because
of
the
greatness
of
their
numbers
;.
yea
,
they
supposed
that
they
should
be
:
privileged
to
:
come
:-
upon
them
as
.
they
:
had
hitherto
done
;
yea
,
and
:
they
:
had
also
prepared
.
themselves
with
shields
;
and
with
Srenhahaian
and
they
[File:379]
had
algo
prepared
themselves
with
garments
.
of
skins
;
yea
,
very
thick
.
garments
,
to
.
cover
.
their
nakedness
..
And
.
being
thus
:
prepared
,
they
.
supposed
that
.
they
should
easily
overpower
and
:
subject
:
their
brethren
.
to
the
yoke
.
ofbondage
,
or
slay
and
massacre
them
according
to
their
pleasure
.
But
behold
,
to
their
uttermost
astonishment
,
they
were
prepared
for
them
,
in
a
manner
which
.
never
had
been
known
among
the
children
of
Lehi
.
Now
they
were
prepared
for
the
Lamanites
,
to
battle
,
after
the
manner
of
the
instructions
of
Moroni
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
,
or
the
Amalickiahites
,
were
exceedingly
astonished
at
their
manner
.
of
preparation
for
war
.
Now
if
king
Amalickiah
had
come
down
out
of
the
land
of
Nephi
,
at
the
head
of
his
army
,
perhaps
he
would
have
caused
the
Lamunites
to
have
attacked
the
Nephites
at
the
city
of
Ammonihah
;
for
behold
,
he
did
care
not
for
the
blood
of
his
people
.
But_behold
,
Amalickiah
did
not
come
down
himself
,
to
battle
.
And
behold
,
his
chief
captains
durst
not
attack
the
Nephites
at
the
city
of
Ammonihah
,
for
Moroni
had
altered
the
management
of
affuirs
among
the
Nephites
,
insomuch
that
the
Lamanites
:-
were
disappointed
in
their
places
of
retreat
,
and
they
could
not
come
upon
them
;
therefore
they
retreated
into
the
wilderness
,
and
took
their
camp
,
and
marched
towards
the
land
of
Noah
,
supposing
that
to
be
the
.
next
best
place
for
them
to
come
against
the
Nephites
;
for
they
knew
not
that
Moroni
had
fortified
or
had
built
forts
of
security
for
every
city
in
all
the
land
round
about
;
therefore
they
marched
forward
to
the
land
of
Noah
,
with
a
firm
determination
;
yea
,
theirchief
captains
came
forward
,
and
took
an
oath
that
:
they
would
destroy
the
people
of
that
city
.
But
behold
,
to
their
astonishment
,
the
city
of
Noah
,
which
had
.
hitherto
been
a
weak
place
,
had
now
,
by
the
means
of
Moroni
,
become
strong
;
yea
,
even
to
exceed
the
strength
of
the
city
Ammonihah
.
And
now
behold
,
this
was
wisdom
in
Moroni
:
for
he
had
supposed
that
they
would
be
frightened
.
at
the
city
Ammonibah
;
and
as
the
city
of
Noah
had
hitherto
:
been
the
Weakest
part
of
the
land
,
therefore
they
would
march
thither'to
.
battle
;
and
thus
it
was
,
according
to
his
-
desires
.,
And
behold
,
Moroni
had
appointed
Lehi
to
.
be
chief
captain
over
the
men
.
of
that
city
;
and
it
-
was
that
same
Lehi
who
fought
with
the
Lamanites
in
the
valley
,
on
:
the
east
of
the
river
Sidon
.
[File:380]
And
now
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
,
that
when
the
Lamanites
had
found
that
Lehicommanded
the
city
,
the
were
again
disappointed
,
for
they
feared
Lehi
exceedingly
;
nevertheless
,
their
chief
captains
had
sworn
with
an
oath
,
to
attack
the
city
therefore
they
brought
up
their
armies
.
Now
behold
,
the
Lamanites
could
not
get
into
their
forts
of
security
,
by
any
other
way
save
by
the
entrance
,
because
of
the
highness
of
:
the
bank
which
had
been
thrown
up
,
and
the
depth
of
the
ditch
which
had
been
dug
round
about
,
save
it
were
by
the
entrance
.
And
thus
were
the
Nephites
prepared
to
destroy
all
such
as
should
attempt
to
climb
up
to
enter
the
fort
by
any
other
way
,
by
casting
over
stones
and
arrows
at
them
.
Thus
they
were
prepared
;
yea
,
a
body
of
their
most
strong
men
,
with
their
swords
and
their
slings
,
tosmite
down
all
who'should
attempt
to
come
into
their
place
of
security
,
by
the
place
of
entrance
;
and
thus
were
they
prepared
to
defend
themselves
against
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
captains
of
the
Lamanites
brought
up
their
armies
before
the
place
of
entrance
;
and
began
to
contend
with
the
,
Nephites
,
to
get
into
their
place
of
security
;
but
behold
,
they
were
driven'
back
from
time
to
time
,
insomuch
that
they
were
slain
,
with
an
immense
slaughter
.
Now
when
they
found
that
they
could
not
obtain
power
over
the
Nephites
.
by
the
pass
,
they
began
to
dig
down
their
banks
of
earth
,
that
they
might
obtain
a
pass
to
their
armies
,
that
they
might
have
an
equal
chance
to
fight
;
but
behold
,
in
these
attempts
,
they
were
-
swept
off
by
the
stones
andthe
arrows
which
were
thrown
at
them
;
and
instead
of
filling
up
their
ditches
by
pulling
down
the
banks
of
earth
,
they
were
filled
up
in
a
measure
,
with
their
dead
:
andwounded
bodies
.
Thus
the
Nephites
had
all
power
over
their
enemies
;
and
thus
the
Lamanites
did
attempt
to
destroy
the
Nephites
,
until
-
their
chief
captains
were
all
slain
;
yea
,
and
more
than
a
thousand
of
the
Lamanites
were
slain
;
while
on
the
other
hand
,
there
was
not
a
single
soul
of
the
Nephites
which
was
slain
.
There
were
about
fifty
who
~were
wounded
,
who
had
been
exposed
to
the
arrows
of
the
Lamanites
through
the
pass
;
but
they
were
shielded'
by
their
shields
,
and
their
breast
-
plates
,
and
their
head
-
plates
,
insomuch
that
their
wounds
were
upon
their
legs
;
many
of
which
were
very
severe

concerning

it
came

angry
with

he

wroth

he
did
curse
God

also
Moroni

and
swearing
with
an
oath
that

would

blood
;
and
this
because

it

CHAPTER
XXII
.
AyD
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
did
not
stop
making
preparations
for
war
,
or
to
defend
his
people
against
the
Lamanites
;
for
he
caused
that
.
his
armies
should
commence
in
the
commencement
of
the
twentieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
that
they
should
commence
in
digging
up
heaps
of
earth
round
abont
all
the
cities
,
throughout
all
the
land
which
was
possessed
.
by
the
Nephites
;
and
upon
the
top
of
these
tidgesof
earth
,
he
caused
that
there
should
be
timbers
;
yea
;
works
of
timbers
built
up
to
the
heighth
of
a
man
,
round
about
the
cities
.
And
he
caused
that
upon
those
:
works
.
of
timbers
,.
there
should
be
.
a
.
frame
of
pickets
built
upon
the
timbers
,
round
about
;
and
they
Were
sttong
:
/and
:-
high
;.
and
he
caused
.
towers
to
be
erected
,
that
:
overlooked
those
works
of
pickets
;
and
[File:382]
he
caused'
places
of
security
to
be
built'
upon
those
towers
,
that
the
stones
and
the
arrows
of
the
Lamanites
could
not
hurt
them
.
And
they
were
prepared
,
that
they
could
cast'stones
from
the
top
thereof
,
according
to
their
pleasure
and
their
strength
,
and
slay
him
who
should
attempt
to
approach
near
,
the
walls
of
the
city
.
Thus
Moroni
did
prepare
strong
holds
against
the
coming
of
their
enemies
,
round
about
every
ity
in
all
the
land
.
\
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
cansed
that
his
armies
should
go
forth
into
the
east
wilderness
;
yea
,
and
they
went
forth
,
and
drove
all
the
Lamanites
who
were
in
the
east
wilderness
into
their
own
lands
,
which
were
south
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
and
the
land
of
Nephi
did
run
in
a
straight
course
from
the
east
sea
to
the
west
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Moroni
had
driven
all
the
Lamanites
out
of
the
east
wilderness
,
which
was
north
of
the
lands
of
their
own
possessions
,
he
caused
that
the
inhabitants
who
were
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
in
the
land
round
about
,
should
go
forth
into
the
east
wilderness
,
even
to
the
borders
,
by
the
sea
shore
,
and
possess
the
land
.
And
he
also
placed
armies
on
the
south
,
in
the
borders
of
their
possessions
,
and
caused
them
to
erect
fortifications
,
that
they
might
secure
their
armies
and
their
people
from
the
hands
of
their
enemies
.
And
thus
he
cut
off
all
fhe
streng
holds
of
the
Lamanites
,
in
the
east
wilderness
;
yea
,
and
-
also
on
the
west
,
fortifying
the
line
between
the
Nephites
and
the
Lamanites
,
between
the
land
of
Zarahemla
and
the
land
of
Nephi
;
from
the
west
sea
,
running
:
by
the
head
of
the
river
Sidon
;
the
Nephites
possessing
all
the
land
northward
;
yea
,
even
ail
the
land
which
was
northward
of
.
the
land
Bountiful
,
according
to
their
pleasure
.
Thus
Moroni
,
with
his
armies
,
which
did
inerease
daily
,
because
of
the
assurance
of
protection
which
his
works
did
bring
forth'
unto
thent
;
tiierefore
they
did
seek
to
cut
off
the
strength
and
the
power
of
the
Lamanites
,
from
off
the
lands
of
their
possessions
,
that
they
should
have
no
power
upon
the
lands
.
of
their
possession
.
And
if
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
began
.
the
foundation
of
acity
;
and
they
called
the
name
of
the
city
Moroni
;
and
it
was
by
the
east
sea
;
and
it
was
on
ule
south
by
the
line
of
the
possessions
of
the'
Lamanites
.
And
they
also
began
a
foundation
for
a
city
between
the
city
of
Moroni
and
the
city
of
Aaron
,
joining
the
borders
of
Aaron
and
Moroni
;
and'they
[File:383]
called
the
name
of
the
city
,
or
the
land
,
Nephihah
..
And
they
also
,
began
,
in
that
same
year
,
to
build
many
cities
on
the
north
;
one
in
a
:
particnlar
manner
which
they
called
Lehi
,
which
:
was
in
the
north
,
by
the'
borders
of
the
seashore
.
And
thus
ended
the
twentieth
year
.
And
in
these
prosperous
circumstances
were
the
:
people
of
Nephi
,
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
they
did
prosper
exceedingly
,
and
they
became
exceeding
rich
;
yea
,
and
they
did
multiply
,
and
were
strong
in
the
land
.
And
thus
we
see
how
merciful
and
just
are
all
the
dealings
of
the
Lord
,
to
the
fulfilling
of
all
his
words
unto
the
children
of
men
;
yea
,
we
can
behold
that
his
words
are
verified
,
even
.
at
this
time
,
which
he
spake
unto
Lehi
,
saying
,
blessed
art
thou
and
thy
children
;
and
they
shall
be
blessed
,
inasmuch
.
as
they
shall
keep
my
commandments
;
they
shall
prosper
inthe
land
.
But
remember
,
inasmuch
as
they
will
not
keep
my
commandments
,
they
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
.
And
we
see
.
that
these
promises
have
been
verified
to
the
people
of
Nephi
;
for
it
has
been
their
quarrellings
and
their
contentions
,
yea
,
their
murderings
,
and
their
plunderings
,
their
idolatry
,
their
.
whoredoms
,
and
their
abominations
,
which
were
amon
themselves
,
which
brought
upon
them
their
wars
saa
their
destructions
.
And
those
who
were
faithful
in
keeping
:
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
,
were
deliy
-
eredvatvall
:
times
,
whilst
thousands
of
their
wicked
brethren
have
been
consigned
to
bondage
,
or
to
perish
by
the
sword
,
or
to
dwindle
in
:
unbelief
,
and
mingle
with
the
:
Lamanites
.
But
behold
there
,
never
was
a
happier
.
{ime
among
the
people
of
Nephi
,
since
:
the
days
of
Nephi
,
than
in
the
days
of
Moroni
;
yea
,
even
at
this'time
,
in
the
twenty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
ofthe
judges
...
And
it
came
to
pass}that
the
twenty
and
.
second
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
also
ended
in
;
peace
;
-
yea
,
and
also
the
twenty
and
third
year
.
.
And
it
.
came
to
pass
that
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
fourth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
there
would
also
-
have
been
peace
among
the
people
of
Nephi
,
-
had
.
it
not
been
for
.
2
.
contention
which
took
place
:
among
.
them
concerning
the
land
of
Lehi
,
and
.
the
land
of
Morianton
,
which
joined
upon
the
borders
of
Lehi
;
both
of
which
were
on
the
borders
by
the
sea
shore
.
For
behold
,
the
people
who
possessed
the
land
[File:384]
of
Morianton
,:
did
claim'a
part
.
of
the
land
.-
of
Lehi
;
therefore
there
began
to
be
a
warm
contention
between
them
,
insomuch
that
the
people
of
Morianton
took
up
arms
against
their
brethren
,
and
they
were
determined
by
the
sword
to
slay
them
.
But
behold
,
the
.
people
who
possessed
the
land
of
Lehi
,
fled
to
the
camp
of
Moroni
,
and
appealed
unto
him
for
assistance
;
for
be
.
hold
,
they
were
not
in
the
wrong
.
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
people
of
Morianton
,
who
were
led
-
by
.
a
man
whose
name
was
Morianton
,
found
that
the
people
of
Lehi
had
fled
to
the
camp
of
Moroni
,
they
were
exceeding
fearful
lest
the
army
of
Moroni
.
should
come
upon
them
,
and
destroy
them
;
therefore
,
Morianton
-
put
it
into
their
hearts
that
the
should
flee
to
the
land
which
was
northward
,
whic
was
covered
with
large
bodies
of
water
,
and
take
-
possession
of
the
land
which
was
northward
.
And
behold
,
they
would
have
carried
this
plan
into
effect
,
(
which
would
have
been
a
cause
to
have
.
been
Jamented
,)
but
behold
,
Morianton
,
being
a
man
of
much
passien
,
therefore
he
was
angry
with
one
of
his
maidseryants
,
and
he
fell
upon
her
,
and
beat
her
much
.
And
it
-
came
to
pass
that
she
fled
,
and
came
over
to
the
camp
of
Moroni
,
and
told
Moroni
all
things
concerning
the
matter
;
and
also
concerning
their
intentions
to
flee
into
the
land
-
northward
.
Now
behold
,
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
Bountiful
,
or
rather
.
Moroni
,
feared
that
they
would
hearken
to
the
words
of
Morianton
,
and
:
unite
with
his
people
,
and
thue
he
would
obtain
possession
of
those
parts
of
the
land
,
which
would
lay
a
foundation
for
serious
consequences
amon
the
people
of
Nephij
..
yea
,
which
consequences
would
.
lead
to
the
overthrow
of
their
liberty
;
therefore
Moroni
sent
an
army
,
'
with
their
camp
,
to
head
the
people
of
-
Morianton
,
to
stop
their
flight
into
the
land
northward
.
And
it
came
to'
pass
that
they
did
not
.
head
them
,
until
they
had
come
.
to
-
the
borders
of
the
land
Desolation
;
and
there
they
did
-
head
them
,
by
the
narrow
pass
which
led
by
the
sea
into
the
land
northward
;
yea
,
by
the
sea
,;
on
the
west
,
and
on
the
east

And
it
came
:
to
pass
that
the
army
.
which
was
sent
by
Moroni
,
which
was
led
:
by
-
a
:
man
whose
name
was

,
did
.
meet
the
people
of
Morianton
;
and
so
stubborn
were
.
the
people
of
Morianton
,.(
being
inspired
-
by
his
wickedness
and
his
flattering
words
,)
that
battle
:
commenced
.
between
them
,
in
the
which
Tean
cum
did
slay
Morianton
,
and
defeat
his
army
,
and
took
[File:385]
them
prisoners
,
and
returned
to
the
camp

of
Moroni
And
,
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
fourth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
-
people
of
Nephi

And
thus
was
the
people
of
Morianton
brought
back
.
And
upon
their
covenanting
to
keep
the
peace
,
they
were
restored
to
the
land
of
Morianton
,
and
a
,
union
,
took
place
between
them
and
the
people
of

Lehi
;
and
they
were
also
restored
to
their
lands

And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
same
year
that
the
eople
of
Nephi
bad
peace
restored
unto
them
,
that
Nephihah
,
the
second
chief
judge
,
died
,
having
filled
the
judgment
seat
with
perfect
uprightness
before
God
;
nevertheless
,
he
had
refused
Alma
to
take
possession
of
those
records
and
those
things
which
were
esteemed
by
Alma
and
his
fathers
to
be
most
sacred
:
therefore
Alma
had
conferred
them
upon
his
son
Helaman
.
Behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
the
son
of
Nephihah
was
appointed
to
fill
the
judgment
seat
,
in
the
stead
of
his
father
;
yea
,
he
was
appointed
chief
judge
,
and
governor
over
the
people
,
with
an
oath
,
and
sacred
ordinance
to
judge
righteously
,
and
to
keep
the
peace
,
and
the
freedom
of
the
people
,

to
grant
unto
them
their
sacred
privileges
to
worship
the
Lord
their
God
:
yea
,
to
support
and
maintain
the
cause
of
God
all
his
days
,
and
to
bring
the
wicked
to
justice
,
according
to
their
crime
.
Now
behold
,
his
name
was
Pahoran
..
And
Pahoran
did
fill
the
seat
of
his
father
,
and
did
commence
his
reign
in
the
end
of
the
twenty
and
fourth

AnD
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and

of

reign
of

the

between

concerning
their

having

commenced
the
twenty

in
peace

nevertheless

they
did
not

maintain

an
entire

in

for
there
began

to
be

a

contention

among

the
people
concerning

the
chief
judge

Pahoran

there
were

a
part

who
desired

But'
behold
,
Pahoran
would
not
:
alter
,
nor
.
suffer
:
the
law
tovbe
altered
;
therefore
he
did
not
hearken
to
those
who
had
sent
in
their
:
voices
with
theirpetitions
,
concerning'the
altering
of
the
:
law
;
therefore
those
who
were
desirous
that
the
law'should
be
altered
,
were
angry
with
-
him
,
and
desiredthat
he
should
no
longer
be
chief
judge
-
over
the
land
;
therefore
there
arose
a
warm
a

concerning

matter

And
it
came'to
pass
that
those
who
.
were
desirous
that
Pahoran
shouldbe
dethroned
from
the
judgment
seat
,
were
called
king
-
men
,
for
they
.
were
desirous
that
-
the
law
.
should
.
be
altered
in
a
:
manner
to
overthrow
the
free
government
,-
and
toestablish
a
:
king
.
over
the
land
:
And
those
who
were
desirous
that
Pahoran
:
should
remain
chief
judge
over
:
the
land
,
took
upon
:
them
the
:
name
of
freemen
;
and
thus
was'
the
division
among
them
:
for
the
freemen
had
sworn
or
covenanted
to
maintain
their
-
rights
,
and
the
privileges
of
their
religion
,
by
a
free
government
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
this
matter
of
their
contention
was
settled
,
by
the
voice
of
the
people
.:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
voice
of
the
people
came
.
in
favor
of
the
freemen
,
and
Pahoran
retained'the
judgment
seat
,
which
caused
much
rejvicing
-
among
the
brethren
of
Pahoran
,
and
also
:
many
of
the
people
of
liberty
;
who
also
put
the
king
-
men
to
silence
,
that
:
they
durst
not
oppose
,
but
.
were
obliged
to
maintain
the
cause
of
freedom
.
Now
those
who
-
were
in
favor
of
kings
,
were
those
of
high
birth
;
and
they
sought
to
be
kings
;
and
they
were
supported
by
those
who
sought
power
and
authority
over
the
people
.
But
behold
,
this
was
a
critical
time
for
such
contentions
to
be
among
the
people
of
Nephi
;
for
behold
,
Amatickiah
had
again
stirred
up
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
the
Lamanites
,
against
the
people
of
the
Nephites
,
and
he
was
gathering
together
soldiers
,
from
all
parts
of
his
land
,
and
arming
them
,
and
preparing
for
war
,
with
all
diligence
;
tor
he
had
sworn
to
drink
the
blood
of
Moroni
Bat
behold
,
-
we
shall
see
:
that
his
.
promise
which
he
made
,
was
rash
;
nevertheless
,
he
-
did
prepare
himself
and
his'
armies
;
to
come
to
battle
against
the
N
oe
Now
his
armies'were
not
so
great
-
as
thoy
had
hitherto
been
,
because
of
the
many
thousands
who
had
been
slain
by
the
hand
of
the
Nephites
;
but
notwithstanding
their
great
Ings
,
Amalickiah
had
:
gathered
together
a
wonderfal
-
great
army
,
insomuch
thathe
feared
not
to
come
[File:387]
down
to
.
the
land
of
Zarahemla
..:
Yea
,
even
Amalickiah
did
.
himself
.
come
-
down
,
at
the
head
-
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
.
was
.
in
the
twenty
and
fifth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
;
and
.
it
.
was
at
the
same
time
that
they
had
began
to
settle
the
affairs
of
their
contentions
concerning
the
chief
judge
,,
Pahoran
.
~
And
it
came
:
to
pass
that
when
.
the
men
.
who
were
called
:
king
-
men
,
had
heard
that
the
Lamanites
were
coming
down
.
to
battle
against
them
,.
they
were
glad
in
their
hearts
,
and
they
refused
to
take
up
arms
;
for
they
were
so
.
wroth
with
the
chiefjudge
,
and
also
with
the
.
people
of
liberty
,
that
-
they
would
.
not
take
up
arms
to
defend
their
country
...
And
.
it
:
came
to
pass
that
when
Moroni
saw
this
,
and
also
saw
that
the
Lamanites
were
coming
into
the
borders
of
:
the
land
,
he
was
exceeding
wroth
,
because
of
the
.
stubbornness
of
those
people
,
whom
he
had
labored
with
.
so
.
much
diligence
to
preserve
;
yea
,
he
was
exceeding
wroth
;
his
soul
was
filled
with
anger
against
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
sent
a
petition
,
with
the
voice
of
the
people
,
unto
the
governor
of
the
land
,
desiting
that
he
should
read
it
,
and
give
him
,
(
Moroni
,)
power
to
compel
those
.
dissenters
to
defend
their
country
,
or
to
put
them
to
death
;
for
it
was
his
.
first
care
to
.
put
an
end
to
such
contentions
,
and
:
dissensions
among
the
people
;
for
behold
,
this
had
been
hitherto
a
cause
of
all
their
destruction
,
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
granted
,
according
to
the
voice
of
the
people
.
-
And
:
it
-
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
commanded
that
his
army
should
..
go
against
those
king
-
men
,
to
pull
down
their
pride
and
their
nobility
,
and
.
level
.
them
With
the
earth
,
or
they
should
take
up
arms
and
support
the
cause
of
liberty
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
.
did
march
forth
against
them
;
and
they
.
did
pull
down
their
!
pride
and
:
their
nobility
,
insomuch
,
that
as
they
did
.
lift
their
.
weapons
of
war
to
fight
against
the
men
of
Moroni
,
they
were
hewn
down
,
and
leveled
to
the
earth
::
And
.
it
:
came
:
to
passthat
there
were
four
thousand
of
those
dissenters
;
who
were
hewn
down
by
.
the
sword
;
and
those
of
their
leaders
who
were
not
slain
in
battle
,
were
taken
.
and
cast
into
Prison
;
for
there
was
no
time
for
their
trials
at
.
this
period
;
and
the
remainder
of
those
-
dissenters
,
rather
than
to
.
be
smote
down
to
,
the
earth
by
the
:
sword
,
yielded
to
the
standard
of
liberty
,
and
were
compelled
to
-
hoist
the
titleof
liberty
upon
their
towers
,
andin
their
-
cities
;
and
to
take
up
.
arma
;
in
defence
of
.
their
[File:388]
country
.
And
thus
Moroni
-
put
-
an
end
to
those
kingmen
,
that
there
were
not
any
known
by
the
appellation
of
king
-
men
;
and
thus
he
put
an
end
to
the
stubbornness
,
and
the
pride
of
those
people
who
professed
the
blood
of
nobility
;
but
they
were
brought
down
to
humble
themselves
like
unto
their
brethren
,
and
to
fight
valiantly
for
their
freedom
from
bondage
.
Behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
while
Morom
was
thus
breaking
down
the
wars
and
-
contentions
among_his
own
people
,
and
subjecting
them
to
peace
and
civilization
,
and
making
regulations
to
prepare
for
war
against
the
Lamauites
,.
behold
,
the
Lamanites
had
come
into
the
land
of
Moroni
,
which
was
.
in
the
borders
by
the
seashore
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
were
not
sufficiently
strong
inthe
city
of
Moroni
;
therefore
Amalickiah
did
drive
them
,
slaying
many
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
took
possession
of
the
city
;
yea
,
possession
of
all
their
fortifications
.
And
those
who
fled
out
of
the
city
of
Moroni
,
came
to
the
city
of
Nephihah
;
and
also
:
the
people
of
the
city
of
Lehi
gathered
themselves
together
,
and
made
preparations
,
and
were
ready
to
receive
the
Lamanites
to
battle
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
Amalickiah
would
not
suffer
the
Lamanites
to
go
against
the
city
of
Nephihah
to
.
battle
,
but
kept
them
down
by
.
the
seashore
,
leaving
men
in
every
city
to
maintain
and
defend
it
;
and
thus
he
went
on
,
taking
possession
of
many
cities
:
the
city
of
Nephihah
,
andthe
city
of
Lehi
,
and
the
city
.
of
Morianton
,
and
the
city
of
Omner
,
and
the
city
of
Gid
,
and
the
city
of
Mulek
,
all
of
which
were
on
the
east
borders
,
by
.
the
seashore
.
.
And
thus
had
the
Lamanites
obtained
,
by
the
cunning
of
Amalickiah
,
so
many
cities
,
by
.
their
numberless
:
hoasts
,.
all
.
of
which
were
strongly
fortified
,
after
the
manner
of
the
fortifications
of
Moroni
;
all
of
-
which
afforded
strong
holds
for
the
Lamanites
.
-
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
marched
to
the
borders
of
the
laud
Bountiful
,
driving
the
Nephites
before
them
,
and
slaying
many
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
-
met
by
Teancum
,
who
had'slain
Morianton
,
and
had
headed
his
people
in
his
flight
...
And
it
came
to
passithat
-
he
headed
Amalickiah
also
,
and
he
was
marching
forth
with
his
numerous
army
;
that
he
might
take
possession
of
the
land'Bountiful
;
and
..
also
the
Jand
northward
,.,
But
behold
,
he
-
met
,
with
:
a
-
disappointment
,
by
being
repulsed
.
by
Teancum
:
and
his
[File:389]
men
,
for
.
they
.
were
.
great
warriors
:
for
.
every
man
.
of
Teancum
did
-
exceed
the
Lamanites
in
their
strength
,
and
in
.
their
skill
of
war
,
insomuch
that
they
did
gain
advantage
over
the
Lamanites
.
ces
And
it
came
to
pass
that'they
did
harrass
them
,
insomuch
that
they
did
slay
themeven
until
it
was
dark
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Teancum
and
his
men
did
pitch
their
tents
in
the
borders
of
the
land
Bountifal
;
and
Amalickiah
did
pitch
his
tents
in
the
borders
on
the
beach
by
the
seashore
,
and
after
this
manner
were
they
driven
.
/
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
night
had
come
,
Teancum
and
his
servant
stole
forth
and
went
out
by
night
,
and
went
into
the
camp
of
Amalickiah
;
and
behold
,
sleep
had
overpowered
them
,
because
of
their
much
fatigue
,
which
was
caused
by
the
laborsand
heat
of
the
day
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Teancum
stole
privily
into
the
tent
of
the
king
,
and
puta
javelin
to
his
heart
;
and
he
did
cause
the
death
of
the
king
immediately
,
that
he
did
net
awake
his
servants
.
And
he
returned
again
.
privily'to
his
own
camp
,
and
behold
,
his
men
were
asleep
;
and
he
awoke
them
,
and
told
them
.
all
the
.
things
that
he
had
done
.
And
he
caused
that
his
armies
.
should
stand
in
readiness
,
lest
the
Lamanites
had
awoke
,
and
should
come
upon
them
.
And
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
fifth
year
of
:
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people

of
Nephi

and
thus
ended
the
days

battle
on
.
that
day
.
And
now
when'the
Lamanites
saw
this
,
they
Were
affrighted
;
and
they
abandoned
their
design
in
marching
into
the
land
:
northward
,
and
retreated
with
all
their
army
into
the
city
,
of
Mulek
,
and
sought
protection
in
their
fortifications
.
And
.
it
came
to
pass
[File:390]
that
?
the
brother
of
Amalickiah
was
appointed
king
overthe
people
;
andhis
name
was
.
Ammoron
:
thus
king
Ammoron
,
the
brother
of
king
Amalickiah
,
wag
appointed
to
reign
in
his
stead
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
command
that
his
people
should
maintain
those'
cities
.
which
they
had
taken
by
the
shedding
of
blood
;
for
they
had
not
taken
any
cities
,
save
they
had
lost
much
blood
,
And
now
Teancum
saw
that
the
Lamanites
were
determined
to
maintain
those
cities
which
they
had
taken
,
and
those
parts
of
the
land
which
they
had
obtained
possession
of
;
and
also
seeing
the
enormity
of
their
number
,
Teancum
thought
it
was
not
expedient
that
he
should
attemptto
attack
them
in
their
forts
;.
but
he
kept
his
men
round
about
,
as
if
maki
:
g
preparations
for
war
;
yea
,
and
truly
he
was
preparing
to
defend
himself
against
them
,
by
casting
up
walls
round
about
,
and
preparing
places
of
resort
.
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
kept
thus
preparing
for
war
,
until
Moroni
had
sent
a'large
number
of
men
to
strengthen
his
army
;
and
Moroni
also
sent
orders'
unto
him
,
that
.
he
should
:
retain
all'
the
prisoners
who
fell
into
his
hands
;
for
as
-
the
Lamanites
had
taken
many
prisoners
,
that
he
should
retain
all
the
prisonersof
the
Lamanites
,
as
a
ransom
for
those
whom
the
Lamanites
had
taken
.
And
he
also
-
sent
orders
unto
him
,
that
he
should
fortify
the
land
Bountiful
,
and
secure
the
narrow
pass
which
led
into
the
land
northward
,
lest
the
Lamanites
should
obtain
-
that
point
,
and
should
have
power
to
harrass
them
on
every
side
.
And
Moroni
also
sent
unto
him
,
desiring
him
that
he
would
be
faithful
in
maintaining
that
quarter
.
of
the
land
,
and
that
.
he
would
seek
every
opportunity
to
scourge
the
Lamanites
in
that
quarter
,
as
much
as
was
in
his
power
,
that'
perhaps
he
might
take
again
,
by
stratagem
or
some
other
way
,
those
cities
woich
had'
been
-
taken
out
of
their
hands
;
and
that
he
also
would
fortify
and
strengthen
the
cities
round
about
,
which
had
not
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
he
also
said'
unto
him
,
J
would
comeunto
you
,
but
.
behold
,
the
Lamanites
are
upon
usin
the
borders
of
the
:
land
by
the
west
-
sea
;
and
behold
,
I
go
against
them
;
therefore
I
cannot
come
unto
your
:
ears
Now
the
king
(
Ammoron
,
)
had
departed
:
out
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,:
and
had
made'
known
unto'
the
queen
concerning'
the
death''of
his
brother
,
and
had
[File:391]
gathered
together
a
large
number
of
men
,
and
had
marched
forth
against
the
Nephites
,-
on
the
borders
by
the
west
sea
;
and
thus
he
was
endeavoring
to
harrass
the
Nephitee
:
and
.
to
-
draw
away
a
part
of
their
forces
to'that
part
of
the
land
,
while
he
had
commanded
those
whom'he
had
left'to
possess
the
cities
which
he
had
taken
,
that
they
should
also
-
harrass
the
Nephites
on
the
borders'
by
the
east
sea
;
and
should
take
possession
of
their
lands
asmuch
as
-
it
was
in
their
power
;
according
to
the
power
of
their
armies
.
And
thus
were
the
:
Nephites
in
those
.
dangerous
circumstances
,
in
the
ending
of
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
ofthe
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
But
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
that
Teancum
,
by
the
command
of
Moroni
,
who
had
established
armies
to
protect
the
south
and
the
:
west
borders
of
the
land
,
had
began
his
march
towards
the
land
Bountiful
,
that
he
might
assist
Teancum
with
his
men
,
in
retaking
the
cities
which
they
had
lost
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Teancum
had
received
orders
to
.
make
an
attack
upon
the
city
of
Mulek
,
and
retake
it
if
it
were
possible
.
And
it
came
to
pass
.
that
Teancum
made
preparations
to
make
an
attack
upon
the
city
of
Mulek
,
and
march
forth
with
his
army
against
the
Lamanites
;
but
he
saw
that
it
was
impossible
that
he
could
overpower
them
while
they
were
in
their
fortifications
;
therefore
he
abandoned
his
designs
,
and
returned
again
to
the
.
city
Bountiful
,
to
wait
for
the
coming
of
Moroni
,
that
he
might
receive'strength
to
his
army
.
â
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
did
arrive
with
his
army
:
to
the
land
:
of
Bountiful
,
in
the
latter
end
of
the
twenty
and
-
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
eighth
year
,
Moroni
and
Teancum
,
and
many
of
the
chief
captains
,
held
a
council
of
war
,
what
they
should
do
'to
.
cause
the
Lamanites
.
to
come
out
against
them
:
to
battle
;
or
that
they
might
by
some
ineans
,
flatter
them
out
of
theirstrong
holds
,
that
they
might
gain'
advantage'over
them
,
and
take
again
the
city
of
Mulek
.
rae
Ti
Oe
And
:
it
came
to
pass
that
they
sent
embassies
to
the
army
of
the
Lamanites
,
which
protected'
the
city
.
of
Mulek
;
'to
their
leader
,
whose
name
was
Jacob
,
desiring
m
that
he
-
would
come
out
with
his
armies'
to
meet
them
upon
:
the
plains
,
between
the
two'cities
.
'
But
[File:392]
behold
,
Jacob
,
who
was
a
Zoramite
,
would
not
come
out
with
his
army
to
meet
them
upon
the
plains
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
,
having
no
hopes
of
meeting
them
upon
fair
grounds
,
therefore
he
re
.
solved
upon
a
plan
that
he
might
decoy
the
Lamanites
out
of
their
strong
holds
.
Therefore
he
-
caused
that
Teancum
should
take
a
small
number
of
men
,
and
march
down
near
the
seashore
:
and
Moroni
and
his
army
,
by
night
,
marched
in
-
the
wilderness
,
on
the
west
of
the
city
Mulek
;
and
thus
,
on
the
morrow
,
when
the
guards
of
the
Lamanites
had
discovered
Teancum
,
they
ran
and
told
it
unto
Jacob
,
their
leader
.
_
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armes
of
the
Lamanites
did
march
forth
against
-
Teancum
,
supposing
by
their
numbers
to
overpower
Teancum
,
because
of
the
smallness
of
his
numbers
.
And
as
Teancum
saw
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
coming
out
against
him
,
he
began
to
retreat
down
by
the
seashore
,
northward
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lamanites
saw
that
he
began
to
flee
,
they
took
courage
and
pursued
them
with
vigor
...
And
while
Teancum
was
thus
leading
away
the
Lamanites
who
were
pursuing
them
in
vain
,
behold
,
Moroni
commanded
that
a
part
of
his
army
who
were
with
him
,
should
march
forth
into
the
city
,
and
take
possession
of
it
,
.
And
thus
they
did
,
and
slew
all
those
who
had
been
left
to
protect
the
city
;
yea
,
all
those
who
would
not
yield
up
their
weapons
of
war
.
And
thus
Moroni
had
obtained
possession
of
the
city
Mulek
,
with
a
part
of
his
army
,
while
.
he
marched
with
the
remainder
to
.
meet
the
Lamanites
,
when
they
should
return
from
the
pursuit
of
Teancum
.
And
:
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
pursue
Teancum
until
they
came
near
the
city
Bountiful
,
and
then
they
were
met
by
Lehi
,
and
a
small
army
,
which
had
been
left
to
protect
the
city
Bountiful
.
And
now
behold
,
when
the
chief
captains
of
the
Lamanites
had
beheld
Lehi
,
with
his
army
,
coming
against
them
,
they
fied
in
much
confusion
,
lest
perhaps
they
should
not
obtain
the
city
Mulek
,
before
Lehi
should
overtake
them
;
for
they
were
wearied
because
of
their
maich
,
and
the
men
of
Lehi
were
fresh
.
Now
the
Lamanites
did
not
know
that
Moroni
had
been
in
their
rear
with
his
army
;
and
all
they
feared
,
was
.
Lehi
and
his
men
.
Now
Lehi
was
not
desirous
:
to
overtake
them
,
till
they
should
meet
Moroni
and
bis
.
army
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
before
the
Lamanites
had
retreated
far
,
they
were
surrounded
by
the
Nepbites
;
by
the
men
of
Mo
[File:393]
roni
on
one
hand
,
and
the
men
of
Lehi
on
the
other
,
all
of
whom
were
fresh
and
.
full
of
strength
;
but
the
Lamanites
were
wearied
,
because
of
their
long
march
..
And
Moroni
commanded
hie
men
that
they
should
fall
.
upon
them
,
until
they
had
given
up
their
weapons
of
war
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Jacob
,
being
their
leader
,
being
also
.
a
Goramite
,
and
having
an
unconquerable
spirit
,
he
led
the
Lamanites
forth
to
battle
,
with
exceeding
fury
against
Moroni
.
Moroni
being
in
their
course
of
march
,
therefore
Jacob
was
determined
to
slay
them
,
and
cut
his
way
through
to
the
city
of
Mulek
.
Butbehold
,
Moroniand
his
men
were
more
powerful
;
therefore
they
did
not
give
way
before
the
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
fought
on
both
hands
with
exceeding
fury
;
and
there
were
many
slain
on
both
sides
;
yea
,
and
Moroni
was
wounded
,
and
Jacob
was
killed
.
And
Lehi
pressed
upon
their
rear
with
such
fury
,
with
his
strong
men
,
that
che
Lamanites
in
the
rear
delivered
up
their
weapons
of
war
;
and
the
remainder
of
them
,
being
much
confused
,
knew
not
whether
to
go
or
to
strike
.
Now
Moroni
seeing
their
confusion
,
fe
said
unto
them
,
if
ye
will
bring
forth
your
weapons
of
war
,
and
deliver
them
up
,
behold
we
will
forbear
shedding
vour
blood
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lamanites
had
heard
these
words
,
their
chief
captains
,
all
those
who
were
not
slain
,
came
forth
and
threw
down
their
weapons
of
war
at
the
feet
of
Moroni
,
and
also
commanded
their
men
that
they
should
do
the
same
;
but
behold
,
there
were
many
that
Would
not
;
and
those
who
would
not
deliver
up
their
swords
,
were
taken
and
bound
,
and
their
weapons
of
War
were
:
taken
.
from
them
,
and
they
were
compelled
to
march
with
their
brethren
forth
into
the
land
Bountiful
.
And
now
the
number
of
prisoners
who
were
taken
,
exceeded
more
than
the
number
of
those
who
ad
been
slain
;
yea
,
more
than
those
who'
had
been
lain
on
both
sides
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
sct
guards
over
the
prisoners
-
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
did
compel
them
to
go
forth
and
bury
their
dead
;
yea
,
and
also
the
dead
of
the
Nephites'
who
were
slain
;
and
Moroni
placed
inen
over
them'to
guard
them
while
they
should
perform
their
labors
.
'
And
Moroni
went
to
:
thie
city
.
of
Malek
with
Lehi
,
and
took
-
command
ofthe
city
,
and
save
it
unto
Lehi
.
Now
behold
this
Lehi
was
a
man
:
[File:394]
who
had
been'
with
Moroni
in
.
the
more
part
.
of
all
his
battles
;
and
he
wasa'man
like
unto
Moroni
;
and
they
rejoiced
in
each
other's
safety
;
yea
,
they
were
beloved
by
each
other
,-
and
also
:
beloved
by
-
all
.
the
people
of
vephi
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
Lamanites
had
finished
burying
their
dead
,
and
also
the
dead'of
the
Nephites
,
they
were
marched
back
into
the
land
Bountiful
;
and
Leancum
,
by
the
orders
of
Moroni
,
caused
that
they
should
commence
laboring
in
digging
a
ditch
round
about
the
land
,
or
the
city
,
Bountitul
;,
and
he
caused
that
they
should
build
.
a
breastwork
of
timbers
upon
the
inner
bank
of
the
ditch
;,
and
they
.
cast
up
dirt
out
of
the
ditch
against
the
breastwork
of
timbers
;
and
thus
they
did
cause
the
Lamanites
to
labor
,
until
they
had
encireled
.
the
city
of
Bountiful
round
about
with
a
strong
.
wall
.
of
timbers
and
.
earth
,
to
an
.
exceeding
height
.
And
.
this
city
became
an
exceeding
strong
hold
ever
after
;
and
in
this
city
they
did
guard
the
prisoners
of
the
Lamanites
;
yea
,
even
within
.
a
wall
,
which
they
had
caused
them
to
build
,
with
their
own
hands
.
Now
Moroni
was
compelled
to
cause
the
Lamanites
to
labor
,.
because
it
,
were
easy
to
.
guard
:
them
while
at
their
labor
;
and
he
desired
all
his
forces
,
when
he
should
make
an
attack
upon
the
Lamanites
.
_And
it
came
.
to
pass
that
Moroni
had
thus
gained
a
victory
over
one
of
ihe
greatest
of
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
had
obtained
possession
of
the
city
Mulek
,
which
was
one
of
the
strongest
,
holds
of
the
Lamanites
in
the
land
of
Nephi
;
and
.
thus
.
he
had
also
built
a
.
strong
hold
to'
retain
his
prisoners
.,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
no
,
more
attempt
.
a
battle
with
the
Lamanites
.
in
that
year
,
but
he
did
employ
his
men
in
preparing
for
war
;..
yea
,
and
in
making
fortifications
to
.
guard
against
the
..
Lamanites
;
yea
,
and
also
delivering
their
women
and
their
children
trom
famine
and
affliction
,
and
providing
food
,
for
:
their
.
armues
And
now
it
-
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
,
on
the
West
Sea
,
south
,
while
-
in
the
absence
of
Moroni
,
on
account
of
some
,
intrigue
.
amongst
the
Nephites
,
which
caused
dissensions
amongst
them
,
had
gained
some
ground
over
the
Nephites
,
yea
,
1ns0much
that
they
had
obtained
.
possession
of
a
number
of
their
cities
in
that
part
of
the
land
;
and
thus
because
of
iniqnity
amongst
themselves
,,
yea
,
because
of
dissensions
and
intrigue
among
themelves
,
they
:
were
pleced
in'
the
most
dangerous
circumstances
.
.
[File:395]
And
.
now
behold
,
I
-
have
somewhat
-
to
say
concerning
the
people
of
Ammon
,
who
,
in
the
begining
,
were
Lamanites
;
but
by
Ammon
and
his
brethren
,
or
rather
by
the
power
and
.
word
of
God
,
they
bad
been
convert
:
ed
unto
the
Lord
;
and
they
had
been
.
brought
down
into
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
had
:
ever
since
been
protected
by
the
Nephites
;
and
because
of
their
oath
,
they
had
been
kept
from
taking
up
arms
against
their
brethren
:
for
they
had
taken
an
oath
,
that
they
never
would
shed
blood
more
;
and
according
to
their
oath
,
they
would'
have
perished
;
yea
,
they
would
have
suffered
themselves
.
to
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
their
brethren
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
pity
.
and
the
exceeding
love
which
Ammon
and
his
brethren
had
-
had
for
them
;
and
for
this
cause
,
they
.
were
brought
down
into
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
and
they
ever
had
been
protected
by
the
Nephites
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
saw
the
danger
,
and
the
many
afflictions
.
and
tribulations
which
the
Nephites
bore
for
them
,
they
were
moved
with
compassion
,
and
were
desirous
to
take
up
arms
in
the
defence
of
their
country
.
.
But'behold
,
as
they
were
about
to
take
their
weapons
of
war
,
they
were
overpowered
by
the
persuasions
of
Helaman
and
-
bis
brethren
,
for
they
were
about
to
break
the
oath
which
they
had
made
;
and
Helamen
feared
lest
by
so
doing
,.
they
should
lose
their
souls
;
therefore
ali
those
who
had
entered
into
this
covenant
;
were
compelled
to
behold
their
brethren
wade
through
their
afflictions
,
in
their
dangerous
circumstances
,
at
this
time
.
But
behold
,
it
came
to
:
pass
they
had
many
sons
,
who
had
not
entered
into
a
covenant
that
they
would
snot
take
their
Weapons
of
war
to
defend
themselves
against
their
enemies
;
therefore
they
did
assemble
themselves
:
together
at
this
time
,
ag
many
.
as
were
able
to
take
up
arms
;
and
they
called
themselves
Nephites
;.
and
they
.
entered
into
a
covenant
,
to
fight
for
the
liberty
of
the
Nephites
;
yea
,
to
protect
the
land
.
unto
the
laying
down
of
their
.
lives
;
yea
,
even
they
covenanted
that
they
never
would
give
up
their
liberty
,
but
.
they
would
fight
in
all
cases
to
protect
the
Nephites
and
themselves
from
bondage
.
.
Now
.
behold
,
there
were
two
thousand
.
of
.
those
young
men
who
.
entered
into
this
covenant
,
.
and
took
their
weapons
of
war
to
defend
their
country
...
And
new
behold
,
asithey
never
:
had
hitherto
been
.
a
disadvantage
to
:
the
Nephites
,
they
became
now
at
this
pe
[File:396]
riod
of
time
also
-
a
great
support
;
for
they
took
their
weapons
of
war
,
and
they
would
that
:
Helaman
should
be
their
leader
.
And
they
were
all
young
men
,
and
they
were
exceeding
valiant
for
courage
,
and
also
for
strength
:
and
uctivity
;
but
behold
,
this
was
not
all
:
they
were
men
who
were
true
at
all
times
in
whatsoever
thing
they
were
entrusted
;
yea
,
they
were
men
of
truth
and
soberness
,
for
they
had
been
taught
to
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
to
walk
uprightly
before
him
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Helaman
did
march
at
the
head
of
his
two
thousand
stripling
soldiers
,
to
the
support
of
the
people
in
the
borders
of
the
land
on
the
south
by
the
West
Sea
.
And
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
&c
.
CHAPTER
XXV
.
Anp
now
it
came
to
passin
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
of
the
judges
,
that
Ammoron
sent
unto
Moroni
,
desiring
that
he
would
exchange
prisoners
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
felt
to
rejoice
exceedingly
at
this
request
,
for
he
desired
.
the
provisions
which
were
imparted
for
the
support
of
the
Lamanite
prisoners
,
for
the
support
of
his
own
people
;.
and
he
also
desired
his
own
people
for
the
strengthening
of
his
army
.
Now
the
Lamanites
had
taken
many
women
and'children
;
and
there
was
not
.
a
woman
nor
a
child
among
all
the
prisoners
of
Moroni
,
or
the
prisoners
whom
Moront
had
taken
;
therefore
Moroni
.
resolved
upon
stratagem
,
to
obtain
as
many
prisoners
of
the
Nephites
from
the
Lamanites
,
as
it
were
possible
;
therefore
he
wrote
an
epistle
,
and
sent
it
by
the
servant
of
.
Ammoron
,
the
same
who
had
brought
an
-
epistle
to
Moron
!.
Now
these'are
the
words
which
he
wrote
:
unto
Ammoron
,
saying
,
behold
,
Ammoron
,
I
.
haye
written
unto
you
somewhat
concerning
this
war
which
ye
have
waged
against
my
people
,
or
rather
-
which
thy
brother
hath
waged
against
them
,:
and
which
.
ye
are
still
determined
to
.
carry
on
afterhis
death
...
Behold
,
would
:
tell
:
you
-
something
concerning
the
justice
of
God
;
and
the
.
sword
:
of'
his
Almighty
wrath
,
which
:
doth
:
hang
[File:397]
over'you
,
except
ye
repent
and
withdraw
your
armies
into
your
own
lands
,
or
the
lands
of
your
possessions
,
which
is
the
land
of
Nephi
;
yea
,
]
would
tell
you
these
things
,
if
ye
were
capable
of
hearkening
unto
them
;
yea
,
I
would
tell
you
concerning
that
awful
hell
that
awaits
to
receive
such
murderers
as
thou
and
thy
brother
have
been
,
except
ye
repent
and
withdraw
~
your
murderous
purposes
,
and
return
,.
with
your
armies
to
your
.
own
lands
;
but
as
ye
have
rejected
these
things
,
and
have
fought
against
the
people
of
the
Lord
,
even
so
may
expect
you
will
do
it
again
.
And
now
behold
,
we
are
prepared
to
receive
you
;
yea
,
and
except
you
withdraw
your
purposes
,
behold
,
ye
will
pull
dawn
the
wrath
of
that
God
whom
you
have
rejected
,
upon
you
,
even
to
your
utter
destruction
;
but
as
the
Lord
liveth
,
our
armies
shall
come
upon
you
,
except
ye
withdraw
,
and
ye
shall
soon
be
visited
with
death
,
for
we
will
retain
our
cities
and
our
lands
;
yea
,
and
we
will
maintain
our
religion
and
the
cause
of
our
God
.
But
behold
,
it
supposeth
me
that
Italk
to
you
concerning
these
things
in
vain
;
or
it
supposeth
me
that
thou
art
a
child
of
hell
;
therefore
I
will
close
my
epistle
,
by
telling
vou
that
[
will
not
exchange
prisoners
,
save
it
be
on
conditions
.
that
ye
will
deliver
up
a
man
,
and
his
wife
,
and
his
children
,
for
one
prisoner
;
if
this
be
the
case
that
ye
will
doit
,
1
will
exchange
.
And
behold
,
if
ye
do
not
this
,
I
will
come
against
you
with
my
armies
;
im
even
will
.
arm
my
women
and
my
children
,
and
will
come
against
you
,
and
I
will
follow
you
even
into
your
own
Jand
,
which
is
the
land
of
our
first
inheritance
;
yeay
.
and
it
shall
be
blood
for
blood
;
yea
,
life
for
life
;
and
I
will
give
you
battle
,
even
until
.
you
are
destroyed
from
off
the
face
of
the
earth
.
Behold
,
am
in
my
anger
,
andalso
my
people
;
ye
have
sought
to
murder
us
,
and
we
have
only
sought
to
defend
ourszlves
:
But
behold
,
if
ye
seek
to
destroy
us
more
,
we
will
seek
to
destroy
you
;
yea
,
and
we
willseek
our
land
of
our
first
inheritance
.
Now
I
close
my
epistle
.
I
am
Moroni
;
ama
leader
of
the
people
of
the
Nephites
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
Ammoron
,
when
he
had
Teceived
this
epistile
,
he
was
angry
;
and
he
.
wrote
another
epistle
unto
Moroni
;
und
these
are
the
words
which
he
wrote
,
saying
,
am
sAmmoron
,
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
:.
J
-
am
the
brother
:
of
Amalickiah
;
whom
ye
have
murdered
.
.
Behold
,
I
will
avenge
his
:
blood
upon
you
;
yea
,
and
I
will
come
upon
you
with
my
[File:398]
armies
,
for
I
fear
not
your
threatnings
..
-
For
.
behold
,
your
fathers
did
wrong
their
brethren
,
insomuch
that
they
did
.
rob
them
of
their
right
to
the
government
,
when
it
rightly
belonged
unto
them
.
And
now
behold
,
if
ye
will
lay
down
your
arms
,
and
subject
yourselves
to
be
governed
by
those
to
whom
the
government
doth
rightly
belong
,
then
will
I
cause
that
my
people
shall
lay
down
their
weapons
,
and
shall
be
at
warno
more
.
Behold
,
ye
have
breathed
out
many
threatnings
against
me
and
my
people
:
but
behold
,
we
fear
not
your
threatnings
;
nevertheless
,
I
will
grant
to
exchange
prisoners
according
to
your
request
,
gladly
,
that
I
.
may
preserve
my
food
for
my
men
.
of
war
;
and
we
will
wage
a
war
which
shall
be
eternal
,
either
to
the
subjecting
the
Nephites
to
our
.
authority
,
or
to
theireternal
.
extinction
.
And
as
concerning
that
God
whom
.
ye
say
we
have
rejected
,
behold
,
we
know
not
such
a
being
;
neither
do
ye
;.
but
if
it
so
be
that
there
is
such
a
being
,
we
know
not
but
that
he
hath
made
us
as
well
.
as
-
you
;
and
if
it
so
be
that
there
is
a
.
devil
and
a
hell
,
behold
,
will
he
not
send
you
there
,
to
dwell
with
my
brother
,
whom
ye
.
have
murdered
,
whom
ye
have
hinted
that
he
hath
gone
to
such
a
place
?
But
behold
,
these
things
mattereth
not
.
Iam
Ammoron
,
and
a
descendant
of
Zoram
,.
whom
your
fathers
pressed
and
brought
.
out
of
Jerusalem
.
And
behold
,
now
;
I
ama
.
bold
Lamanite
.
Behold
,
this
war
hath
been
waged
,
to
avenge
their
wrongs
,
and
to
maintain
,
and
to
obtain
their
rights
to
.
the
government
;
and
I
close
.
my
epistle
to
Moroni
,
Now
it
.
came
to
:
pass
that
when
Moroni
had
received
this
epistle
,
he
was
more
angry
,
because
he
knew
-
that
Ammoron
had
a
perfect
knowledge
of
his
fraud
;
yea
,
he
knew
.
that
Ammoron
knew'
that
.
it
was
not
-
a
just
cause
that
had
caused
him
to
wage
a
war
against
the
people'of
Nephi
.
And
he
said
:
behold
,
I
will
not
exchange
prisonerswith
Ammoron
,
save
he
will
withdraw
his
purpose
,
as
I
have
stated
in
my
epistle
;
for
PE
will
not
grant
unto
-
him
that
he'shall
have
-
any
more
power
than
what
he
hath
got
.
Behold
,
I
know
the
place
:
where
the
Lamanites
doth
guard
my
people
,
whom
they
:
have
taken
.
prisoners
;
and
as'
Ammoron
would
not
grant
unto
me
:
mine'
epistle
,
behold
,
I
will
give
-
unto
him
)
according
to
my
words
;
yea
,
I
-
will
seek
death
among
them
,
until
they
shall
sue
for
peaceAnd
now
it
:
came
toÂ®
pass
that
-
when
Moroni
had
said
these
words
,
he
cause
that
a
search
shouldbe
made
[File:399]
among
his
men
,
that
perhaps
he
might
find
a
mah
who
was
a
descendant
of
Laman
among
them
.
'
i
-
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
fourid
one
,
whose
name
was
Laman
;
and
he
was
one
of
the
-
servants
of
the
king
who
was
murdered
by
Amalickiah
.
Now
Moroni
caused
that
Laman
and
a
small
-
number
of
his
men
,
should
go
forth
unto
the
guards
who
were
over
the
Nephites
.
Now
the
Nephites
we
:
eiguarded
inthe
city
of
Gid
;
therefore
Moroni
appointed
Laman
and
caused
that
a
small
number
of
men
should
go
with
him
.
-
oe
And
when
it
was
evening
,
Laman
went
to
the
guards
who
were
over
the
Nephites
,
and
behold
,
they
saw
him
coming
,
and
they
hailed
him
.
But
he
saith
unto
them
,
fear
not
.
Behold
,
I
-
am
a
Lamanite
.
Behold
,
we
have
escaped
from
the
Nephites
,
and
they
sleepeth
;
and
behold
,
we
have
took
of
their
wine
,
and
brought
with
us
.
Now
,
when
the
Lamanites
heard
these
words
,
they
received
him
with
joy
.
And
they
said
unto
him
,
give
us
of
your
wine
,
that
we
may
drink
;
we
are
glad
that
ye
have
thus
taken
wine
with
you
,
for
we
are
weary
.
But
Laman
said
unto
them
,
let
us
keep
of
our
wine
till
we
go
against
the
Nephites
to
battle
.
But
this
saying
only
made
them
more
desirous
to
drink
ofthe
wine
.
For
,
saidthey
,
we
are
weary
;
therefore
let
us
take
of
the
wine
,
and
-
by'and
by
we'shall
teceive
wine
for
our
rations
,
which
will
strengthen
us
to
go
against
the
Nephites
.
And
Laman
said
unto
them
,
you
may
do
according
to'
your
desires
.-
And
it
'
came
to
pass
that
they
did
take
of
the
wine
freely
,
and
it
Was
pleasant
to
their
taste
;
therefore
they
took
of
it
more
freely
;
and
it
was
strong
,
having
been
prepared
in
its
strength
.
ahi
And
it'came
to
pass
they
did
drink
and
were
merry
,
and
by
and
by
they
were
all
drunken
.
And
now
when
Laman
and
his
men
saw
that
they
were
all
drunken
,
and
were
in
a
deep
sleep
,
they
rerurned
to
Moroni
,
andtold
him
all
the
things
that
had
happened
.
And
now
;
this
was
.
according
to
the
design
of
Moroni
:
And
Moroni
had'
prepared
his
men
with
weapons
of
War
;
and
he
sent
to
the
city
Gid
,
while
the
Lamanites
werein
a
deep
sleep
,
and
drunken
,
and
cast
in'
the
Weapons
of
war
in
unto
the
prisoners
,
insomuch
that
they
were
all
armed
;
yea
,
even
to
their
women
,
and
all
those
of
their
children
,
as
many
as
were
able
to'tise
a
Weapon'
of
war
;
when
Moroni
hadatmedall
those
[File:400]
prisoners
,.
And
.
all
.
those
things
were
done
.
in
-
a
:
profound
silence
.
But
had
they
.
awoke
the
Lamanites
,
behold
they
were
druken
,
and
the
Nephites
could
have
slain
them
...
But
behold
this
wag
not
the
desire
of
:
Moroni
.
He
did
not
delight
in
murder
or
bloodshed
;
but
he
delighted
in
the
saving
of
his
people
from
destruction
;.
and
for
this
.
cause
he
might
not
bring
upon
him
injustice
,
he
would
not
fall
upon
the
Lamanites
and
destroy
them
in
their
drunkeriness
.
-
But
he
had
obtained
his
desires
;
for
:
he
.
had
armed
those
prisoners
of
the
.
Nephites
who
were
within
the
wall
of
the
city
,
and
had
gave
them
power
to
.
gain
possession
of
those
parts
which
were
within
the
walls
;
and
then
he
caused
the
men
who
were
with
him
,
to
withdraw
a
pace
from
them
,
and
surround
the
armies
.
of
the
Lamanites
.
Now
behold
,
this
was
done
in
the
night
time
,
so
that
when
the
Lamanites
awoke
in
the
morning
,
they
heheld
that
they
were
surrounded
by
the
.
Nephites
without
,
and
that
their
prisoners
were
armed
.
within
.
And
thus
they
saw
.
that
the
Nephites
had
power
over
them
;.
and
in
these
circumstances
they
found
that
it
was
not
expedient
thatthey
should
fight
with
the
Nephites
;
therefore
their
chief
.
captains
demanded
their
weapons
of
war
,
and
they
.
brought
them
forth
,
and
cast
them
at
the
feet
-
of
the
Nephites
,
pleading
for
mercy
.
Now
behold
,
this
was
the
desire
of
Moroni
.
He
took
them
prisoners
of
war
,
and
took
possession
of
the
city
,
and
caused
that
all
the
prisoners
should
be
liberated
,
who
were
Nephites
;
and
they
did
join
the
army
of
Moroni
,
and
were
a
great
strength
to
.
his
army
.
__
And
it
came
:
to
pass
that
he
did
cause
the
Lamanites
whom
he
had
taken
.
prisoners
,
that
they
should
commence
a
labor
in
strengthening
the
fortifications
round
about
the
city
Gid
.
And
it
.
came
to
pass
that
when
he
had
fortified
the
city
Gid
,
according
to
his
desires
,
he
caused
that
his
prisoners
shouldbe
taken
to
the
city
Bountiful
.
And
he
also
guarded
.
that
city
with
an
exceeding
strong
force
...
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
,
notwithstanding
all
the
intrigues
of
the
Lamanites
,
keep
and
protect
all
the
prisoners
whom
they
had
taken
,
and
.
also
maintain
.
all
the
.
ground
and
the
advantage
which
they
had
retaken
...
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
began
again
to
be
victorious
,
and
to
reclaim
their
rights
and
their
privileges
...
Many
times
did
the
Lamanites
.
attempt
to
.
encircle
them
about
.
by
night
,
but
in
these
.
attempts
they
did
lose
many
prisoners
.
And
many
times
did
they
attempt
[File:401]
to
administer
of
their
wine
to
the
Nephites
,
that
they
might
destroy
them
with
poison
or
with
drunkenness
.
But
behold
,
the
Nephites
were
not
slow
to
remember
the
Lord
their
God
,
in
this
their
times
of
affliction
,
They
could
not
betaken
in'
their
snares
;
yea
,
they
would
not
partake
of
their
wine
,
save
they
had
firstly
given
to
some
of
the
Lamanite
prisoners
,
And
they
were
thus
cautious
,
that
no
poison
should
be
administered
among
them
;
for
if
their
wine
would
poison'a
Lamanite
,
1t
would
also
poison
a
Nephite
;
and
thus
they
did
try
all
their
liquors
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was'
expedient
for
Moroni
to
make
preparations
to
attack
the
city
Morianton
.
For
behold
,
the
Lamanites
had
,
by
their
labors
,
fortified
the
city
Morianton
until
it
had
become
an
exceeding
strong
hold
;
and
they
were
continually
bringing
new
forces
inte
that
city
,
and
also
new
supplies
of
provisions
.
And
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
....
CHAPTER
XXVI
.
Axp
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
in
the
second
day
,
on
the
first
month
,
Moroni
received
an
epistle
from
Helaman
,
stating
the
affairs
of
the
people
in
that
quarter
of
the
land
.
And
these
are
the'
words
which
he
wrote
,
saying
,
my
dearly
beloved
brother
,
Moroni
,
a3
well
in
the
Lord
as
in
the
tribulations
of
our
warfare
;
behold
,
my
beloved
brother
,
I
have
somewhat
to
tell
you
concerning
our
warfare
in
this
part
of
the
land
.
Behold
,
two'thousand
of
the
sons
of
those
men
whom
Ammon
brought
down
out
of
the
land
of
Nephi
,
Now
ye
have
known
that
these
were
a
descendant
of
Laman
,
who
was
the
eldest
son
of
our
father
Lehi
.
Now
I
need
not
rehearse
unto
you
oncerning
their
traditions
or
their
unbelief
,
for
thou
knowest
concerning
all
these
things}
therefore
it
supposeth
me
that
I
tell
you
that
two
thousand
of
these
young
men
have
taken
their
weapons
of
war
,
and
Would
that
I'should
be
their
leader
;
and
we'have'come
forth
to
defend
dur
country
.
'
And
:
now
:
ye
also'know
concerning
the
covenant
which
their
fathersâ
made
,
[File:402]
that
.
they
would
not
take
up
their
:
weapons
of
war
against
their
brethren
,
to
,
shed
.
blood
.
But
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
,
when
they
saw
our
afflictions
and
our
tribulations
for
them
,
they
were
about
to
break
the
covenant
which
they
had
made
,
and
take
up
their
weapons
of
warin
our
defence
.
But
I
would
not
suffer
them
that
they
should
break
this
covenant
which
they
had
made
,
supposing
that
God
.
would
strengthen
us
,
insomuch
.
that
,
we
should
not
suffer
more
because
of
the
fulfilling
the
oath
which
they
had
taken
.
But
behold
,
here
is
one
thing
in
which
we
may
have
great
joy
.
-
For
behold
,
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
,
I
Heaman
,
did
march
at
the
head
of
these
two
thousand
young
men
,
to
the
city
of
Judea
,
to
assist
Antipus
,
whom
ye
had
:
appointed
a
leader
over
the
people
of
that
part
.
of
the
land
.
And
I
did
join
my
two
thousand
sonny
(
for
they
are
worthy
to
be
called
sons
)
to
the
army
of
Antipus
;
in
which
strength
Antipus
did
rejoice
exceedingly
;:
for
behold
,
his
army
had
been
reduced
by
the
Lamanites
because
their
forces
had
slain
a
vast
number
of
.
our
men
;
for
which
cause
we
have
to
mourn
.
Nevertheless
,
we
may
console
ourselves
in
this
point
:
that
they
have
died
in
the
causc
of
their
country
and
of
their
God
;
yea
,
and
they
are
happy
.
And
the
Lamanites/
had
also
retained
many
prisoners
,
all
of
whom
are
chief
captains
;
for
none
other
have
they
.
spared
.
alive
..
And
,
we
suppose
that
they
are
now
at
this
time
in
the
land
of
Nephi
;
it
is
so
if
they
are
not
slain
.
And
now
.
these
are
the
cities
which
the
Lamanites
have
obtained
possession
,
by
the
sheddin
of
the
blood
of
so
.
many
of
our
valiant
.
men
:
The
lan
of
Manti
,
or
the
city
of
Manti
,
and
the
city
of
Zeezrom
,
and
the
city
of
Cumeni
,
and
the
city
of
Antiparah
,
And
these
are
the
.
cities
which
baer
poseensed
when
I
arrived
at
the
city
.
of
Judea
;
and
I
found
Antipus
.
and
his
men
.
toiling
with
their
mights
to
forty
the
city
:
yea
,
and
they
were
depressed
in
body
as
we
as
in
spirit
;
for
they
had
fought
valiantly
by
day
,
and
toiled
by
night
,
to
.
maintain
.
their
cities
;
and
.
thus
they
had
suffered
great
afflictions
.
of
every
kind
..
And
now
they
were
.
determined
to
conquer
in
this
place
,
or
.
die
;
therefore
you
.
may
.
well
.
suppose
.
that
this
little
force
.
which
I
brought
,
.
with
me
;
yea
,
those
.
sons
of
mine
,
gave
them
great
hopes
and
mueh
joy
,
:
-
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lamanites
gaw
that
.
Antipus
had
received
9
greater
.
strength
to
hia
army
,
they
.
were
compelled
,
by
.
the
qrdexe
.
of
Au
[File:403]
moron
,
to
.
net
come
against
the
city
of
Judea
,
or
against
us
,
to
battle
.
And
thus
were
we
favored
of
the
Lord
;.
for
had
they
come
upon
us
in
this
our
weakness
,
they
might
have
perhaps
.
destroyed
our
little
army
;
but
thus
were
we
preserved
.
They
were
commanded
.
by
Ammoron
to
maintain
those
cities
which
they
had
taken
.
And
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
sixth
year
.
And
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
seventh
year
,
we
had
prepared
our
city
and
ourselves
for
defence
.
Now
we
were
desirous
that
the
Lamanites
should
.
come
upon
us
;
for
we
were
Â©
not
desirous
to
make
an
attack
upon
them
in
their
strong
holds
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
kept
spies
out
round
about
,
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
might
not
pass
us
by
night
,
nor
by
day
,
tomake
an
attack
upon
our
other
cities
,
which
were
on
the
northward
;
for
we
knew
in
those
cities
they
were
not
sufficiently
strong
to
meet
them
;
therefore
we
were
desirous
,
if
they
should
pass
by
,
us
,
to
fall
upon
them
in
their
rear
,
and
thus
bring
them
up
in
the
rear
,
at
the
same
time
they
were
met
in
the
front
.
We
supposed
that
we
could
overpower
them
;
but
behold
,
we
were
disappointed
in
this
our
desire
.
_They
durst
not
pass
by
us
with
their
whole
army
;
neither
durst
they
with
a
pert
lest
they
should
not
he
sufficiently
strong
,
and
they
should
fall
.
Neither
durst
they
march
down
against
the
city
of
Zarahemla
;
neither
durst
they
cross
the
head
of
Sidon
,
over
to
the
city
of
Nephihah
.
And
thus
,
with
their
forces
,
they
were
determined
to
maintain
those
cities
which
they
had
taken
,
.
_
And
now
it
cane
to
pags
,
in
the
second
month
of
this
year
,
there
was
bronght
unto
us
many
provisions
,
from
the
fathers
of
those
my
two
thousand
sons
.
And
also
there
was
sent
,
two
thousand
men
unto
us
,
from
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
And
thus
we
were
prepared
With
ten
thousand
men
,
and
provisions
for
them
,
and
also
for
their
wives
,
and
their
children
,
And
the
LaManites
,
thus
seeing
our
forces
increase
daily
,
and
rovisions
arrive
for
our
support
,
they
began
to
be
earful
,
and
began
to
sally
forth
,
if
it
were
possible
,
to
Rien
end
to
our
receiving
.
provisions
and
strength
.
Now
-
when
we
saw
that
the
Lamanites
began
to
grow
_Mneagy
on
this
wise
,
we
were
desirous
to
bring
astratages
inte
effect
upon
them
;
therefore
Antipus
ordered
that
I
should
march
forth
with
my
little
song
,
to
a
nsighboring
:
city
,
gs
if
we
were
carrying
provisions
to
.
[File:404]
a
neighboring
city
.
And
we
were
to
march
near
the
city
of
Antiparah
,
as
if
we
were
going
to
the
city
beyond
,
in
the
borders
by
the
seashore
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
march
forth
,
as
if
with
our
provisions
,
to
go
.
to
that
city
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Antipus
did
march
forth
,
with
a
part
of
his
army
,
leaving
the
remainder
to
maintain
the
city
:
But
he
did
not
march
forth
,
until
I
had
gone
forth
with
my
.
little
army
,
and
came
near
the
city
Antiparah
.
And
now
in
the
city
Antiparah
,
were
stationed
the
strongest
army
of
the
.
Lamanites
;
yea
,
the
most
numerous
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
been
informed
by
their
spies
,
they
came
forth
with
their
army
,
and
marched
against
us
.
_
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
flee
before
them
,
northward
.
And
thus
we
did
lead
away
the
most
powerful
army
of
the
Lamanites
;
yea
,
even
to
a
considerable
distance
,
insomuch
that
when
they
saw
the
army
of
Antipus
pursuing
them
,
with
their
mights
,
they
did
not
turn
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
,
but
pursued
their
march
in
a
straight
course
after
us
:
and
,
as
we
supposed
,
it
was
their
intent
to
slay
us
before
Antipus
should
overtake
them
,
and
this
that
they
might
not
be
surrounded
by
our
people
.
And
now
Antipus
,
beholding
our
danger
,
did
speed
the
march
ofhis
army
.
But
behold
,
it
wasnight
;
therefore
they
did
not
overtake
us
,
neither
did
Antipus
overtake
them
;
therefore
we
did
camp
for
thenight
.
And
it
came
to
pase
that
before
the
dawn
of
the
morning
,
behold
,
the
Lamanites
were
pursuing
us
..
Now
we
were
not
sufficiently
strong
to
contend
with
them
;
yea
,
I
would
not
suffer
that
my
little
sons
should
fall
into
their
hands
;
therefore
we
did
continue
our
.
march
;
and
we
took
our
march
into
the
wilderness
.
Now
they
durst
not
turn
to
.
the
right
nor
to
the
left
,
lest
they
should
be
surrounded
:
neither
would
I
turn
.
to
the
right
or
to'
the
left
,
lest
they
should
overtake
me
,
and
we
could
not
stand
against
them
,
but
be
slain
,
and
they
would
make
their
escape
;
and
thus
we
did
flee
all
that
day
-
into
the
wilderness
,
even
until
it
wasdak
And
it
came
to
pass
that
again'
when
the
light
of
the
morning
came
,
we
saw
the
Lamanites
upon
us
,
and
we
did
flee
before
them
,
But
it
came
to
ass
that
they
did
not
pursue
us
far
,
before
they
halted
;
and
it
was
in
the
morning
of
the
third
day
,
on
the
seventh
month
.
And
now
whether
they
were
overtaken
by
[File:405]
Antipus
,
we
knew
not
;.
but
I
said
unto
,
my
men
,
behold
,
we
know
not
but
they
have
.
halted
for
the
purpose
that
we
should
come
against
them
,
that
they
might
catch
us
in
their
snare
;
therefore
what
say
ye
,
my
sons
,
will
ye
go
against
them
to
battle
?
.
And
now
.
1
say
unto
.
you
my
beloved
brother
..
Moroni
,
that
never
had
I
seen
so_great
courage
,
nay
,
not
.
amongst
all
the
Nephites
.
Foras
I
had
ever
called
.
them
my
sons
,
(
for
they
were
all
of
them
very
young
,)
even
so
they
said
unto
me
,
father
,
behold
,
our
God
is
.
with
us
,
and
he
will
not
suffer
that
we
shall
fall
;
then
Jet
us
go
forth
;
we
would
not
slay
aur
brethren
,
if
they
would
let
us
alone
;
therefore
let
us
go
,
lest
they
should
overpower
the
army
of
Antipus
.
Now
they
never
had
fought
,
yet
they
did
not
fear
death
;
and
they
did
think
more
upon
the
liberty
of
their
fathers
,
than
they
did
upon
their
lives
;
yea
,
they
had
.
been
taught
by
their
mothers
,
that
if
they
did
not
doubt
,
that
God
.
would
deliver
-
them
,
And
they
rehearsed
unto
.
me
-
the
words
of
their
mothers
,
saying
,
we
do
nat
doubt
.
our
.
mothers
knew
it
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Idid
return
with
my
two
thousand
,
against
these
Lamanites
who
had
.
pursued
us
.
And
now
behold
,
the
armies
of
Antipus
had
overtaken
them
,
and
a
terrible
battle
had
commenced
..
The
army
of
Antipus
being
weary
,
because
of
their
long
march
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
,
were
about
to
fall
into
.
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
;
and
had
I
not
returned
with
my
two
thousand
,
they
would
have
obtained
their
purpose
;
for
Antipus
had
fallen
by
the
sword
,
and
many
of
his
leaders
,
because
of
their
weaTiness
,
which
was
occasioned
by
the
speed
.
of
their
march
;
therefore
the
men
of
Antipus
.
being
confused
,
because
of
the
fall
of
their
leaders
,
began
to
give
way
before
the
Lamanites
.
.
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
took
courage
,
and
began
to
pursue
them
;
and
thus
were
.
the
Lamanites
pursuing
them
with
great
vigor
,
when
He~
laman
came
upon
their
rear
with
his
two
.
thousand
,
and
began
to
slay
them
exceedingly
,
insomuch
that
the
whole
army
ofthe
.
Lamanites
halted
,
and
turned
upon
Helaman
..,
Now
.
when
the
people
of
.
Antipus
saw
that
the
Lamanites
had
turned
them
about
,
they
gathered
together
their
men
,
and
came
again
upon
the
tear
of
the
.
Tamanites
.
;
i
And
now
:
it
came
to
pass
that
we
,
the
people
of
Nephi
,
the
people
of
Antipus
,
and
I
with
my
two
thou
[File:406]
sand
,
did
surround
the
Lamanites
,
and
did
slay
them
;
yea
,
insomuch
that
they
were
compellce
to
deliver
up
their
weapons
of
war
,
and
also
themselves
as
prisoners
of
war
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
surrendered
themselves
up
unto
us
,
behold
,
I
numbered
those
young
men
who
had
fouglit
with
me
,
fearing
Test
there
were
many
of
them
slain
.
But
behold
,
to
my
great
joy
,
there
had
not
one'soul
of
them
fallen
to
the
earth
;
yea
,
and
they
had
fought
as
if
with
the
strength
of
God
;
yea
,
never
was
men
known
to
have
fought
with
such
miraculous
strength
;
and
with'such
mighty
power
did
they
fall
upon
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
did
frighten
them
;
and
for
this
cause
did
the
Lamanites
deliver
theniselves
up
as
prisoners
of
War
.
And
as
we
had
no
place
for
ourprisoners
,
that
we
could
guard
them
to
keep
them
from
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
,
therefore
we
sent
them
to
the
land
of
Zarahemila
,
and
a
part
of
those
men
who
were
not
slain
of
Antipus
,
with
them
;
and
the
remainder
Itook
and
joined
them
to
my
stripling
Ammorites
,
and
.
took'our
march
back
to
the
city
of
Judea
.
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
I
received
an
epistle
from
Ammoron
,
the
king
,
stating
that
if
T
would
deliver
up
those
prisoners
of
war
whom
we
had
taken
,
that
he
would'
deliverup
the
city
af
Antiparah
unto
us
.
But
T'sent
an
epistle
unto
the
king
,
that
we
were
sure
our
forces
were
sufficient
to
take
the
city
o
!
Antiparah
by
our
force
;
and
by
delivering
up
the
prisoners
for
that
city
,
we
should
suppose
:
ourselves
.
unwise
,
and
that
we
would
only
deliver
up
our
prisoners
on
exchange
.
And
Ammoron
refused
mine
epistle
,
for
he
would
not
exchange
prisoners
;
therefore
we'bean
to
make
preparations'
to
go
against
the
city
of
ntiparah
.
But
the
people
of
Antiparah
did
leave
the'city
,
and
fled
to
their
other
cities
which
they
had
possession
of
,
to
fortify
them
;
and
thus
the'
city
of
Antiparah
fell
into
our
hands
.
'
And
thus
ended
the
twenty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
commencement
of
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
;
we
received
a
supply
of
provisions
,
and
also
an
addition'
to
our
army
,
from
the
.
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
from
'the
land
round
about
,
to
the
number
of
six
thousand
men
,
besides
sixty
of
the
sons
of
the
Ammorites
,
who
had
come
to
join
their
-
brethren
;
my'
little
band
of
two
thousand
.
And
noW
[File:407]
behold
;
we
were
strong
;
yea
,
and
we
had
also
a
plenty
of
provisions
brought
unto
us
.
And
it
:
came
to
:
pass
that
it
was
our
desire
to
wage
a
battle
with
the
army
which
was
placed
:
to
protect
the
city
Cumeni
.
And
now
behold
;
1
will
shew
unto
you
that
we
soon
accomplished
our
desire
;.
yea
,
with
our
strong
force
,
or
with
a
part
of
our
strong
force
,
we
did'surround
,
by
night
,
the
city'
Cumeni
,
a
little
before
they
were
to
receive
a
supply
of
provisionsi
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
camp
.
round
about
the
city
for
many
nights
;
but
we
did
sleep
upon
our
swords
;
and
keep
guards
,
that
the
Lamanites
could
not
come
upon
us
by
night
,
and
slay'us
,
which
they
attempted
many
times
;
but
as
manytimes
as
they
attempted
this
,
their
blood
was
spilt
.
At
length
their
provisions
did'
arrive
,
and
they
were
about
to
enter
the
city
by
night
.
And
we
,
instead
of
being
Lamanites
,
were
Nephites
;
therefore
,
we
did
take
them
and
their
provisions
.
And
notwithstanding
the
Lamanites
being
cut
off
from
their
support
after
this
manner
,
they
were
still
determined
to
maititain
the
city
;
therefore
it
became
expedient
that
we
should
take
those
provisions
and
send
them
to
Judea
and
our
prisoners
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
ne
And
it
came
to
pass
that
not
many
days
had
passed
away
,
before
the
Lamanites
began
to
lose
all
hopes
of
succor
;
therefore
they
yielded
up
the
-
city~into
our
hands
;
and
thus
we
had
accomplished
our
designs
,
in
obtaining
the
city
Cumeni
.
But
it'came
to
pass
that
ar
prisoners
were
so
numerous
,
that
notwithstanding
the
enormity
of
our
numbers
,
we
were
obliged
to
employ
-
all
our
force
to
keep
them
,
or
to
put
them
to
death
.
For
behold
,
they
would
break
out
in
great
numbers
,
and
would
fight
with
stones
,
and
with
clubs
,
or
whatsoever
things
they
could
get
into
their
hands
,
msomuch'that
wedid
slay
upwards
of
two
thousand
of
them
,
after
they
had
surrendered
themselves
prisoners
of
:
war
;
therefore
it
became
expedient
for
us
,
that
-
we
should
put
an
end
to
their
lives
,
or
guard
them
,
sword
in
hand
,
down
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
and
also
our
provisions
were
hot
any
more
than
sufiicient
for
out
own
people
,
notwithstanding
that
which
we
hadtaken
from
the
Lamanites
.
And
now
,
in
those'critical
circumstances
,
it
became
a
very
serious
matter
:
to
determine
concerning
these
prisoners
of
war
;
nevertheless
,
we
did
resolve
to
send
them
down
to
the
[File:408]
land
of
Zarahemla
;
therefore
we
:
selected
.
a
part
.
of
our
men
,
and
gave
them
charge
over
our
prisoners
,
to
go
down
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
gio
fog
But
it
came
to
.
pass
that
on
the
morrow
,
they
.
did
return
.
And
now
behold
,
we
did
not
inquire
of
them
concerning
the
prisoners
;
for
behold
,
the
Lamanites
were
upon
us
,
and
thev
returned
in
season
to
save
us
from
falling
into
their
hands
.
For
behold
,
Ammoron
had
sent
to
.
their
support
a
new
supply
.
of
provisions
,
and
also
a
numerous
army
of
men
.
:
And
il
came
to
,
pass
that
those
men
whom
we
-
sent
with
the
prisoners
,
did
arrive
in
season
to
check
them
,
as
they
were
about
to
overpower
us
.
But
behold
,
my
little
band
of
two
thousand
and
sixty
,
fought
.
most
desperately
:
yea
,
they
were
firm
before
the
Lamanites
,
and
did
adininister
:
death
unto
all
those
who
opposed
them
;
and
as
-
the
remainder
of
our
army
-
were
about
to
-
give
way
before
the
Lamanites
,
behold
,
those
two
thousand
and
sixty
.
were
firm
and
undaunted
:
yea
,
and
they
did
obey
,
and
-
observe
to
perform
every
word
.
of
command
with
exactness
;
yea
,
-
and
even
aecording
to
their
faith
,
it
was
done
unto
them
;
and
]
did
.
remember
the
words
which
.
they
said
unto
.
me
that
their
mothers
had
taught
them
.
-
And
now
_
behold
,
it
was
.
these
,
my
sons
,
and
those
men
who
had_
been
selected
to
convey
the
prisoners
,
to
whom
we
owe
this
great
victory
;
for
it
was
they
who
did
beat
the
Lamanites
;
therefore
they
were
driven
back
to
the
.
city
of
Manti
..
And
we
retainedour
city
Cumeni
,.
and
were
not
all
destroyed
by
thesword
;
nevertheless
,
we
had
suffered
great
loss
.
4
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
the
Lamanites
had
fled
,
I
immediately
gave
orders
that
my
men
who
had
been
wounded
,
should
be
taken
from
among
the
dead
,
and
caused
that
their
wounds
should
be
dressed
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
two
hundred
,
out
of
my
two
thousand
and
sixty
,
who
-
had
,
fainted
because
of
the
loss
of
blood
;
nevertheless
,
according
.
to
the
goodness
of
God
,
and
to
our
great
astonishment
,
and
also
the
foes
of
our
whole
army
,
there
was
.
not
.
one
soul
of
them
who
did
perish
;
yea
,
and
neither
was
there
one
soul
among
them
who
had
.
not
received
many
.
wounds
,
And
now
,
their
preservation
was
a8tonishing
.
to
.
our
whole
army+
,
yea
,.
that
:
they
:
should
be
spared
,
while
there
was
a
thousand
.
of
our
brethren
who
,
were
slain
.
'
And
.
we
,
do
,
justly
-
ascribe
-
it
to
the
miraculous
power
of
God
,,
because
of
their
exceeding
z
[File:409]
faith
in
:
that
which
they
had
been
taught
.
to
.
believe
,
that
there
.
was
.
a
just
God
;
and
whosoever
did
not
doubt
,
that
they
should
be
preserved
by
his
.
marvelous
power
.
Now
this
was
the
faith
of
these
of
whom
I
have
spoken
;
they
are
young
,
and
their
minds
are
firm
;
and
they
do
put
their
trust
in
God
continually
.
And
now
if
came
to
pass
that
after
we
had
thug
!
taken
care
of
our
wounded
men
,
and
had
buried
our
dead
,
and
also
the
dead
of
the
Lamanites
,
who
were
many
,
behold
,
we
did
inquire
of
Gid
concerning
the
risoners
whom
they
had
started
to
go
down
to
the
[aad
of
Zarahemla
with
.
Now
Gid
was
the
chief
captain
over
the
band
who
was
appointed
to
guard
them
down
to
the
land
.
And
now
,
these
are
the
words
which
Gid
said
unto
me
,
behold
,
we
did
start
to
go
down
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
with
our
prisoners
.
And
it
came
to
pass
:
that
we
did
meet
the
spies
of
our
armies
,
who
had
been
sent
out
to
watch
the
camp
of
the
Lamanites
.
And
they
cried
unto
us
,
saying
,
behold
,
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
are
marching
towards
the
city
of
Cumeni
;
and
behold
,
they
will
fall
upon
them
,
yea
,
and
will
destroy
our
people
.
And
it
came
-
to
pass
that
our
prisoners'
did
hear
their
cries
,
which
caused
them
to
take
courage
;
and
they
did
rise
up
in
rebellion
against
us
.
And
it
came
to
pass
because
of
their
rebellion
,
we
did
cause
that
our
swords
should
come
upon
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
,
ina
body
,
run
upon
our
swords
,
in
the
which
,
the
greater
number
of
them
were
slain
;
and
the
remainder
of
them
broke
through
and
fled
from
us
.
And
behold
,
when
they
had
fled
,
and
we
could
not
overtake
them
,
we
took
our
march
with
speed
towards
the
city
Cumeni
;
and
behold
,
we
did
arrive
in
time
that
we
might
assist
our
brethren
in
preserving
the
city
.
And
behold
,
we
are
again
deliyered
out
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies
...:
And
blessed
is
the
name
of
our
God
:
for
bebold
,
itvis
..
he
that
has
delivered
us
;
yea
,
that
has
done
this
great
.
thing
for
us
.
a
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
I
,
Helaman
,
had
heard
these
words
of
Gid
,
I
was
filled
with
exceeding
Joy
,
because
of
the
goodness
of
God
in
preserving
us
,
that
.
we'might
not
all
perish
;
yea
,
and
I
trust
that
the
souls
of
them
.
who
have
been
slain
,
have
entered
into
the
rest
.
of
their
God
,
,
[File:410]
And
behold
,-
now
it
came
to'
pass
thatour
next
object
was
to
obtain
the
city
of
Manti
;
but
behold
,
there
was
no
way
that
we
could
lead
them
out
ofthe
city
,
by
our
small
bands
.
For
behold
they
remembered
that
which
we
had
hitherto
.
done
;
therefore
we
could
not
decoy
them
away'
from
their
strong
holds
;
and
they
were
so
much
more
numerous
than
was
our
army
,
that
we
durst
not
go
forth
and
attack
theny'in
their
strong
holds
.
Yea
,
and
it
became
expedient
-
that
we
should
employ
our
men
,
to
the
maintaining
those
parts
of
the
land
,
of
the
which
we
had
retained
of
our
possessions
;
therefore
it
became
expedient'
that
we
should
wait
,
that
we
might
receive
more
strength
from
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
also
a
new
supply
of
provisions
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
thus
-
did
-
send
an
embassy
to
the
governor
of
our
Jand
,
to
-
acquaint
him
concerning
the
affairs
of
our
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
wait
to
receive
provisions
and
strength
,
from
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
But
behold
,
this
did
not
profit
us
but
little
:
for
the
Lamanites
were
also
receiving
great
strength
,
from
day
to
day
,
and
also
many
provisions
;
and
thus
were
our
circumstances
at
this
period
of
time
.
And
the
Lamanites
were
sallying
forth
against
us
,
from
time
to
time
,
resolving
by
stratagem
,
to
destroy
us
;
nevertheless
,
we
could
not
-
come
to
battle
with
them
,
because
of
their
retreats
and
their
strong
holds
.
=~
And
it
came
topags
that
we
did
wait
in'
these
difficult
circumstances
,
for
the
space
of
many
months
,
even
until
we
were
-
about
to
perish
:
for
the
want
of
food
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did'
reeeive
food
,
which
was
guarded
to
us
by
an
army
of
two
thousand
men
,
to
our
assistance
;
and
this
is
all
the
assistance
which
we
did
receive
,
to'
defend
ourselves
and
our
country
from
falling
into
the
hands
:
of
our
enemies
;
yea
,
to
contend
.
with
an
enemy
which
was
innumereble
.
And
now
-
the
cause
of
these
our
embarrassments
,
or
the
cause
why
they
did
not'send
more
strength
unto
us
,
we
knew
not
;
therefore
we
were
grieved
,
and
also
filled
with
fear
,
lest
by
any
means
the
judgments
of
God
should
comeupon
our
land
,
to'our
overthrow
and
utter
destruction
;
therefore
we
did
pour
out
our
souls
in
prayer
to
God
,
that
he
would
strengthen
us
and
deliver
us
out'of
the
harids
of
our
enemies
;
yea
,
and
also
give
us
strength
,
that
wee'
might
retain
our
scities
,
and
our
lands
,
and
our
possessions
,
for
the
sup
[File:411]
port
of
our
people
.
Yea
,
and
it
came
to
pass
.
that
the
Lord
our
God
did
visit
us
with
assurances
,
that
he
would
deliver
us
;
yea
,
insomuch
that
he
did
speak
peace
to
our
souls
,
and
did
grant
unto
us
great
faith
,
and
did
cause
us
that
we
should
hope
for
our
deliverance
-
in
him
;
and
we
did
take
courage
with
our
small
force
which
we
hid
recived
,
and
were
fixed
with
a
determination
to
conquer
our
enemies
,
and
to
maintain
our
lands
,
and
our
possessions
,
and
our
wives
;
.
and
our
children
,
and
the
cause
of
our
liberty
.
â
And
thus
we
did
go
forth
with
all
our
might
against
the
Lamanites
,
who
were
in
the
city
of
Manti
;.
and
we
did
pitch
our
tents
by
the
wilderness
side
,
which
was
near
to
the
city
.,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
,
that
when
the
Lamanites
saw
that
we
were
in
the
borders
by
the
wilderness
which
was
near
the
city
,
that
they
sent
out
their
spies
round
about
us
,
that
they
might
discover
the
number
and
the
strength
of
our
army
.
i
'
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
saw
that
we
were
not
strong
,
according
to
our
numbers
,
and
:
fearing
that'
we
should
cut
them
off
from
their
support
,
except
they
should
come
out
to
battle
against
us
,
and
kill
us
,
and
also
supposing
that
they
could'
easily
destroy
us
with
their
numerous
hosts
,
therefore
they
bean
to
make
preparations
:
to
come
out
against
us
.
to
battle
.
And
when
we'saw
that
they
were
making
preparations
to
come
out
against
us
,
behold
,
I
caused
that
.
Gid
,
with
a
small
number
of
men
,
should
secrete
himself
in
the
wilderness
,
and
also
that
Teomner
should
,
with
a
small
number
of
men
,
secrete
themselves
also'in
the
wilderness
.
Now
Gid
and
his
men
Were
on
the
right
,
and
the
others
on
the
left
;
and
When
they
had
thus
secreted
themselves
;
behold
,
I
remained
with
the
remainder
of
my
army
,
in
that
same
place
where
we
had
first
pitched
our
tents
,
against
a
time
that
the
Lamanites
should
come
out
to
bat
e
,
_And
it
-
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
come
out
with
their
numerous
army
against
us
.
And
when
they
-
had
come
and
were
about
to
fall
upon
us
with
the
sword
,
I
caused
that
my
men
,
those
-
who
were
With
me
,
should
retreat
into
the
wilderness
.
And
it
:
came
to
pass
that
the
:
Lamanites
did
follow
after
.
us'with
great
speed
,
for
they
were
exceedingly
desirous
!
'to
overtake
us
,
'
that
they
mightslay
us
;
therefore
:
theydid
follow
us
-
into
the
wilderness
;
and
[File:412]
we
,
did
pass
by
in
the
midst
of
Gid
and
Teomner
,
insomuch
that
they
were
not
discovered
by
the
Laman
.
ites
.
_And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lamanites
had
a
by
,
or
when
the
army
had
passed
by
,
Gid
and
eomner
did
rise
up
from
their
secret
places
,
and
did
cut
off
the
,
spies
of
the
Langgnites
,
that
they
should
not
return
to
the
city
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
cut
them
off
,
they
ran
to
the
city
,
and
fell
upon
the
guards
who
were
left
to
guard
the
city
,
insomuch
that
they
did
destroy
them
,
and
.
did
take
possession
of
the
city
.
Now
this
was
done
because
the
Lamanites
did
suffer
their
whole
army
,
save
a
few
guards
only
,
to
be
led
away
into
the
wilderness
.
__
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Gid
and
Teomner
,
by
this
means
,
had
obiained
possession
of
their
strong
holds
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
took
our
course
,
after
having
travelled
much
in
the
wilderness
,
towards
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
And
when
the
Lamanites
.
saw
that
they
were
marching
towards
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
they
were
exceeding
fraid
,
lest
there
was
a
plan
laid
to
lead
them
on
to
destruction
;
therefore
they
began
to
retreat
into
the
wilderness
again
,
yea
,
even
back
by
the
same
way
which
they
had
came
..
And
behold
,
it
was
night
,
and
they
did
pitch
their
tents
;
for
the
chief
captains
of
the
Lamanites
had
supposed
that
the
Nephites
were
weary
,
because
of
their
march
;
and
supposing
that
they
had
driven
their
whole
army
,
therefore
they
took
no
thought
concern
ing
the
city
of
Manti
,
ow
it
came
to
pass
that
when
it
was
night
,
that
]
caused
that
my
men
should
net
sleep
,
but
that
they
should
march
forward
,
by
another
way
,
towards
the
land
of
Manti
.
And
because
of
this
our
march
ih
the
night
time
,
behold
,
on
the
morrow
,
we
were
beyond
the
Lamanites
,
insomuch
that
we
did
.
arrive
before
them
to
the
city
of
Manti
.
And
thus
it
came
to
pass
,
that
by
this
statagem
,
we
did
take
possession
of
the
city
of
Manti
,
without
the
shedding
of
blood
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
did
arrive
near
the
city
,
and
saw
that
we
were
prepared
to
meet
them
,
they
,
were
astonished
exceedingly
,
and
.
struck
with
great
fear
,
.
insomuch
that
they
did
flee
into
.
the
wilderness
...
Yea
,
and
it
came
to
.
pass
.
that
the
armies
.
of
the
Lamanites
.
did
flee
out
.
of
all
.
this
.
quarter
of
the

land

But
,
behold
,
they
have

canried
:
with

[File:413]
ren
out
of
the
Jand
,
And
those
cities
which
had
been
taken
by
the
Lamanites
,
all
of
them
are
at
this
period
of
time
in
our
possession
;
and
our
fathers
,
and
our
women
,
and
our
children
,
are'
returning
to
their
homes
,
all
save
it
be
those
who
have
been
taken
prisoners
and
carried
off
by
the
Lamanites
.
But
behold
,
our
armies
are
small
,
to
maintain
so
great
a
number
of
cities
,
and
so
great
possessions
.
But
behold
,
we
trust
that
our
God
,
who
has
given
us
victory
over
those
lands
,
insomuch
that
we
have
obtained
those
cities
and
those
lands
,
which
were
our
own
.
Now
we
do
not
know
the
cause
that
the
government
does
not
grant
us
more
strength
;
neither
do
those
men
who
came
up
unto
us
,
know
why
we
have
not
received
.
greater
strength
.
Behold
,
we
do
not
know
but
what
ye
are
unsuccessful
,
and
ye
have
drawn
away
the
forees
into
that
quarter
of
the
land
;
if
so
,
we
do
not
desire
to
murmur
.
And
if
it
is
not
so
,
behold
,
we
fear
that
there
is
some
faction
in
the
government
,
that
they
do
not
send
more
men
to
our
assistance
;
for
we
know
that
they
are
more
numerous
than
that
whichthey
have
sent
.
But
behold
,
it
mattereth
not
;
we
trust
God
will
deliver
us
,
notwithstanding
the
weakness
of
our
armies
,
yea
,
and
deliver
us
out
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies
.
Behold
,
this
is
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
,
in
the
latter
end
,
and
we
are
in
the
possession
of
our
lands
;
and
the
Lamanites
have
fled
to
the
land
of
Nephi
.
And
those
sons
of
the
people
of
Ammon
of
whom
I
have
so
highly
spoken
,
are
with
me
in
the
city
of
Manti
;
and
the
Lord
has
supported
them
,
yea
,
and
kept
them
from
falling
by
the
sword
,
insomuch
that
even
one
soul
has
not
been
slain
.
But
behold
,
they
have
received
many
wounds
;
nevertheless
they
stand
fast
in
that
liberty
wherewith
God
has
made
them
free
;
and
they
are
strict
to
remember
the
Lord
their
God
,
from

;
yea
,
they
do
observe
to
keep
his
statutes

his
judgments
,
and
his
commandments
continually
;
and
their
faith
is
strong
in
the
prophecies
concerning
that
which

And
now
my

that
the

CHAPTER
AXVH
.
Now
,
it
came
.
to
pass
in
the
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
jadges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
after
Moroni
had
.
received
and
had
.
read
Helaman's
epistle
,
he
was
exceedingly
rejoiced
because
of
the
welfare
,
yea
,
the
exceeding
success
which
Helaman
had
had
,
in
obtaining
those
lands
which
were
lost
;
yea
,.
and
he
did
make
it
known
unto
.
all
his
people
in
all
the
land
round
about
in
that
part
where
he
was
,
that
they
might
rejoice
also
.
nd
it
came
to
pass
that
he
immediately
sent
an
epistle
to
Pahoran
,
desiring
that
he
should
cause
men
to
be
gathered
together
,
to
strengthen
Helaman
,
or
the
armies
of
Helaman
,
insomuch
that
he
might
with
ease
maintain
.
that
part
of
the
land
which
he
had
been
so
miraculously
.
prospered
in
retaining
.
And
it
came
to
pass
when
Moroni
had
sent
this
epistle
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
he
began
again
to
lay
a
plan
,
that
he
might
obtain
the
remainder
of
those
possessions
and
cities
which
the
Lamanites
had
taken
from
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
while
Moroni
was
thus
making
preparations
to
go
against
the
Lamanites
lo
battle
,
behold
,
the
people
of
Nephihah
who
were
gathered
together
from
the
city
of
Morom
,
and
the
city
of
Lehi
,
and
the
city
of
Morianton
,
were
attacked
by
the
Lamanites
;
yea
,
even
those
who
had
been
compelled
to
flee
from
the
land
of
Manti
,
and
:
from
the
.
land
round
about
,
had
come
over
and
joined
the
Lamanites
in
this
part
of
the
land
;
and
thus
being
exceeding
numerous
,
yea
,
and
receiving
strength
from
day
to
day
,
by
the
command
of
Ammoron
,
they
came
forth
against
the
people
of
Nephihah
,
and
they
did
.
begin
:
to
slay
them
with
an
exceeding
great
slaughter
.
And
,
ther
armies
were
so
numerous
,
that
the
remainder
of
the
people
of
Nephihah
were
obliged
to
flee
,
before
them
;
and
they
came
even
and
joined
the
,
army
.
of
Moron
.
And
now
as
Moroni
had
supposed
that
,
there
should
be
men
sent
to
the
city
of
Nephihah
,
to
the
assistance
of
.
the
people
to
maintain
that
city
,
and
knowing
thet
it
was
easier
to
keep
the
city
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
than
to
retake
it
from
them
,
he
supposed
that
they
would
easily
maintain
that
.
city
;,
therefore
he
retained
all
his
force
to
.
maintain
those
places
which
he
had
.
recovered

And
.
now
when
Moroni
saw
,
that
,
the
,
city
of
Nepht
hah
was
lost
,
he
.
was
exceeding
sorrowful
,
and
.
begs
?
[File:415]
to
doubt
,
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
,
whether
they
should
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
their
brethren
.
Now
this
was
the
case
with
all
.
his
.
chief
captains
.
They
doubted
and
marveled
also
,
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
;
and
this
because
of
the
success
of
the
Lamanites
overthem
.
And
itcame
to
pass
that
Moroni
was
angry
with
the
government
,
because
of
their
indifference
concerning
the
freedom
of
their
country
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
wrote
again
to
the
governor
of
the
land
,
who
was
Pahoran
,
and
these
are
the
words
which
he
wrote
,
saying
,
behold
,
I
direct
mine
epistle
to
Pahoran
,
in
the
city
of
Zarahemla
,
who
is
the
chief
judge
and
the
governor
over
the
land
,
and
also
to
all
those
who
have
been
chosen
by
this
people
to
govern
and
manage
the
affairs
of
this
war
;
for
behold
,
I
have
somewhat
to
say
unto
them
by
the
way
.
of
condemnation
;
for
behold
,
ye
yourselves
know
that
ye
have
been
appointed
to
gather
together
men
,
and
arm
them
with
swords
,
and
with
cimeters
,
and
all
manner
of
weapons
of
war
,
of
every
kind
,
and
send
forth
against
the
Lamanites
,
in
whatsoever
parts
they
should
come
into
our
land
.
And
now
:
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
myself
,
and
also
my
men
,-
and
also
Helaman
and
his
men
,
have
suffered
exceeding
great
sufferings
;
yea
,
even
hunger
,
thirst
,
and
fatigue
,
and
all
manner
of
afflictions
of
every
kind
.
But
behold
,
were
this
all
we
had
suffered
,
we
would
not
:
murmur
nor
complain
;
but
behold
,
great
has
been
the
slaughter
among
our
people
;
yea
,
thousands
have
fallen
by
the
sword
while
it
might
have
otherwise
been
,
if
ye
had
rendered
unto
our
armies
sufficient
strength
and
succor
for
them
.
Yea
,
great
has
been
your
neglect
:
towatds'us
.
And
now
behold
,
we
desire
to
know
the
cause
of
this
exceeding
great
neglect
;
yea
,
we
desire
to
know
the
cause
of
your
thoughtless
state
.
Can
you
think
to
:
sit
upon
your
thrones
,
in
a
state
of
thoughtless
stupor
,
while
your
enemies
are
spreading
the
work
of
.
death
around
you
?
Yea
,
while
they
are
murdering
thousands
of'your
brethren
;
yea
,
even
they
who
have
looked
up
to
you
for
protection
,
yea
,
have
placed
you
in
a
situation
that
ye
might
have
succored
them
;
yea
;
ye
might
have
sent
armis
unto
them
,
to
have
strengthened
them
,
and
have
saved
thousands
of
them
from
falling
by
the
sword
?
But'
behold
,
this
is
not
all
;
ye
have
evithheld
your
provisions'
from
them
,
insomuch'that
many
have
fought
and'
bled
out
:
their
[File:416]
lives
because
of
their
great
desires
which
they
had
for
the
welfare
of
this
people
;
yea
,
and
this
they
have
done
,
when
they
were
about
to
perish
with
hunger
,
because
of
your
exceeding
great
neglect
towards
them
,
And
now
,
my
beloved
brethren
;
for
ye
had
ought
to
be
beloved
:
yea
,
and
ye
had
ought
to
have
stirred
yourselves
more
diligently
for
the
welfare
and
the
freedom
of
this
people
;
but
behold
,
ye
have
neglected
them
,
insomuch
that
the
blood
of
thousands
shall
come
upon
your
heads
for
vengeance
;
yea
,
for
known
unto
Goi
were
all
their
cries
,
and
all
their
sufferings
.
Behold
,
could
ye
suppose
that
ye
could
sit
upon
your
thrones
,
and'
because
of
the
exceeding
goodness
of
God
,
ye
could
do
nothing
,
and
he
would
deliver
you
?
Behold
,
if
ye
have
supposed
this
,
ye
have
supposed
in
vain
.
Do
ye
suppose
that
,
because
so
many
.
of
your
brethren
have
been
killed
,
because
of
their
wickedness
?.
I
say
unto
you
,
if
ye
have
supposed
this
,
ye
have
supposed
in
vain
:
for
I
say
unto
you
,
there
are
many
who
have
fallen
by
the
sword
;
and
behold
,
itis
to
your
condemnation
;
for
the
Lord
suffereth
the
righteous
to
be
slain
,
that
his
justice
and
judgment
may
come
upon
the
wicked
;
therefore
ye
need
not
suppose
that
the
righteous
are
lost
because
they
are
slain
;
but
behold
,
they
do
enter
into
the
rest
of
the
Lord
their
:
'God
.
And
now
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
1
fear
exceedingly
that
the
judgments
of
God
will
come
upon
this
people
,
because
of
their
exceeding
slothfulness
;
yea
,
even
the
slothfulness
,
of
our
government
,
and
their
exceding
great
neglect
towards
their
brethren
,
yea
towards
those
who
have
been
slain
:
For
were
it
not
for
the
wickedness
which
first
commenced
at
our
head
,.
we
could
have
withstood
our
enemies
,
that
they
could
have
gained
no
power
over
us
:
yea
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
war
which
broke
out
among
ourselves
;-
yea
,
were
it
not
for
these
king
-
men
,
who
caused
so
much
.
bloodshed
among
ourselves
;
yea
,
at
the
time
we
were
contending
among
ourselves
,
if
we
had
united
our
strength
,
as
.
we
hitherto
have
done
;
yea
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
desire
of
power
and
,
authority
which
those
king
-
men
had
over
us
;
had
they
been
true
to
the
cause
of
our
freedom
,
and
united
with
us
,
and
gone
forth
against
our
enemies
,
instead
of
teking
up
their
swords
against
us
,
which
.
was
the
.
cause
of
so
much
:
bloodshed
.
among
ourselves
;
yea
,
if
we
had
gone
forth
.
against
.
them
,
in'the
.
strength
of
the
'
Lord
,:.
we
;
should
.
bave
.
despersed
.
our
enemies
;
for
-
il
[File:417]
would
have
been
done
according
to
the
fulfilling
of
his
word
.
But
behold
,
now
the
Lamanites
are
coming
upon
us
,
and
they
are
murdering
our
people
with
the
sword
;
yea
,
our
women
and
our
children
;
taking
possession
of
our
lands
,
and
also
carrying
them
away
captive
;
causing
them
that
they
should
suffer
all
manner
of
afilictions
;
and
this
because
of
the
great
wickedness
of
those
who
are
seeking
for
power
and
authority
;
yea
,
even
trose
king
-
men
.
But
why
should
I
say
much
concerning
this
matter
,
for
we
know
.
not
but
what
ye
yourselves
are
secking
for
authority
?
We
know
not
but
what
ye
are
also
traitors
to
your
country
?
Or
is
if
that
ye
have
neglected
us
because
yeare
in
the
heart
of
our
country
,
and
ye
are
surrounded
by
security
,
that
ye
do
not
cause
food
to
be
sent
unto
us
,
and
also
men
to
strengthen
our
armies
?
Have
ye
forgot
the
commandments
of
the
Lord
your
God
?
Yea
,
have
ye
forgot
the
captivity
of
our
fathers
?
Have
ye
forgot
the
many
times
we
have
beer
.
delivered
out
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies
?
Or
do
ye
suppose
that
the
Lord
will
still
deliver
.
us
,
while
we
sit
upon
our
thrones
,
and
do
not
make
use
of
the
means
which
the
Lord
has
provided
for
ust
.
Yea
,
will
ye
sit
in
idleness
,
while
ye
are
serrounded
with
thousands
of
those
,
yea
,
and
tens
of
thousands
,
who
do
also
sit
in
idleness
,
while
there
are
thousands
round
about
in
the
borders
of
the
land
,
who
are
falling
by
the
sword
,
yea
,
wounded
and
bleeding
?
Do
ye
suppose
that
God
will
look
upon
you
as
guiltless
,
while
ye
sit
stilland
behold
these
things
?
Behold
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
.
Now
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
that
Ged
.
has
said
that
the
inward
vessel
shall
be
cleansed
first
,
and
then
shall
the
outer
vessel
be
cleansed
also
.
And
now
except
ye
do
repent
of
that
which
ye
have
done
,
and
begin
to
.
be
up
and
doing
,
and
send
forth
food
and
men
unto
us
,
and
also
unto
Helaman
,
that
he
may
support
those
parts
of
our
country
which
he
has
retained
,
and
that
we
may
also
recover
the
remainder
of
our
possessions
in
these
parts
,
behold
it
will
be
expedient
that
we
contend
no
more
with
the
Lamanites
until
we
have
first
cleansed
our
inward
vessel
;
yea
,
even
the
great
head
.
of
our
government
;.
and
except
ye
grant
mine
epistle
,
and
come
cut
and
shew
unto
me
a
,
true
spirit
of
freedom
,
and
strive
to
strengthen
.
and
fortify
.
our
armies
,
and
grant
unto
them
food
for
their
support
,
,
bebold
,
I
.
will
leave
.
a
part
.
of
my
freemen
to
maintain
this
part
of
our
land
,
.
and
).
J
will
,
[File:418]
leave
the
strength
and
the
blessings
of
God
upon
them
,
that
none
other
power
can
operate
against
them
;
and
this
because
of
their
exceeding
faith
and
their
patience
in
their
tribulations
;
and
J
will
come
unto
you
,
and
if
there
be
any
among
you
:
that
hasa
desire
for
freedom
,
yea
,
if
there
be
even
a
spark
of
freedom
remaining
,
behold
I
will
stir
up
insurrections
among
you
,
even
until
those
who
have
desires
to
usurp
power
and
authority
,
shall
become
extinct
;
yea
,
behold
I
do
wot
fear
your
power
nor
your
authority
,
but
it
is
my
God
whom
.
I
fear
,
and
it
is
according
to
his
commandments
that
I
do
take
my
sword
to
defend
the
cause
of
my
country
,
and
it
is
because
of
your
iniquity
that
we
have
suffered
so
much
loss
.
Behold
it
is
time
;
yea
,
the
time
is
now
at
hand
,
that
except
ye
do
bestir
yourselves
in
the
defence
of
your
country
and
your
little
ones
,
the
sword
of
justice
doth
hang
over
you
;
yea
,
and
it
shall
fall
upon
you
and
visit
you
evento
your
ulter
destruction
,
Behold
,
I
wait
for
assistance
from
you
,
and
except
ye
do
administer
unto
our
relief
,
behold
I
come
unto
you
even
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
smite
you
with
the
sword
,
insomuch
that
ye
can
-
have
no
more
power
to
impede
the
progress
of
this
people
in
the
cause
of
our
freedom
;
for
behold
the
Lord
will
not
suffer
that
ye
shall
:
live
and
wax
strong
in
your
iniquities
,
to
destroy
his
righteous
people
.
Behold
,
can
you
suppose
that
the
Lord
will
spare
you
and
come
out
in
judgment
against
the
Lamanites
,
when
it
is
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
that
has
caused
their
hatred
;
yea
,
and
it
has
beemredoubled'
by
those
who
have
dissented
from
us
,
while
your
iniquity
is
for
the
cause
of
your
love
off
glory
,
and
the
vain
things
of
the
world
?
Ye
know
that
ye
do
transgress
the
laws
of
God
,
and
ye
do
know
that
e
do
trample
them
under
yorir
feet
.
Behold
,
the
ord
saith
unto
me
,
if
those
whom
ye
have
appointed
your
governors
,
do
not
repent
of
their
sins
and
iniqulties
,
ye
shall
go
up
to
battle
against
them
.
And
now
behold
,
I
Moroni
am
constramed
,
according
to
the
covenatit
which
I
have
made
to
keep
the
command
:
ments
of
my
God
;
therefore
J
would
that
ye
should
adhere
to
the
word
of
God
,
and
send
speedily
unto
me
of
your
provisions
and
of
your
men
,
and'also
to
Heleman
.
And
behold
if
ye
will
not
do
this
,
I
come
unto
you
speedily
;
for
behold
;
God
will
not
suffer
that
we
should
perish
with
hunger
;
'
therefore
-
he
will'
give
un
,
tous
of
your
food
,
even
if
it
must
!
besby
the
sword
[File:419]
Now
see
that
ye
-
fulfil
the
word
of
God
.
Behold
,
I
am
Moroni
,
your
chief
captain
.
I
seek
not
for
power
but'to
pull
it
down
.
JT
seek
not
for
honor
of
.
the
world
,
but
for
the
glory
of
my
God
,
and
the
freedom
and
welfare
of
my
country
.
And
thusI
close
mine
epistle
.
CHAPTER
XXVIII
.
Bexorp
,
now
it
came
to
pass
that
soon
after
Moroni
had
sent
his
epistle
unto
the
chief
governor
,
he
reeeived
an
epistle
from
Pahoran
,
the
chief
governor
..
And
these
are
the
words
which
he
received
:
J
,
Pahoran
,
who
am
the
chief
governor
of
this
land
,
do
send
these
words
unto
Moroni
,
the
chief
captain
over
the
army
,
behold
I
say
unto
you
,
Moroni
,
that
I
do
not
joy
in
your
great
afflictions
;
yea
,
it
grieves'
my
soul
.
But
behold
,
there
are
those
who
do
joy
in
your
afflietions
;
yea
,
insomuch
:
that
they
have
risen
up
in
rebelllon
against
me
,
and
also
those
of
my
people
who
are
freemen
;
yea
,
and
those
who
have
risen
up
,
are
exceeding
numerous
.
And
it
is
those
who
have
sought
to
take
away
the
judgment
seat
from
me
,
that
have
been
the
cause
of
this
great
iniquity
;
for
they
have
used
great
flattery
;
and
they
have
led
away
the
hearts
ofmany
people
,
which
will
be
the
cause
of
sore
afiliction
among
us
;
they
have
withheld
our
provisions
,
and
have
daunted
our'freemen
,
that
they
have
not
-
come
unto
you
:
And
behold
,
they
have
driven
me
out
before
them
,
arid
I
have
fled
to
the
land
of
Gideon
,
with
as
many
men
as
it
were
possible
that
I
could
get
.
And
behold
,
I
have
sent
:
a
proclamation
throughout
this
part
of
the
land
;
and
belrold
,
they
are
flocking
to
us
daily
,
to
their
arms
,
in
the
defence
of
their
country
,
and
their
freedom
,
and
to
avenge
our
wrongs
.
And
they
have
eome
unto
us
,
insomuch
that
those
who
have
nsen
up
in
rebellion
againstsus
,
are
set
at
defiance
;
yea
,
insomuch
that
they
do
fear
us
,
and
durst
not
come
:
out
against
us
to
battle
.
They
have
got
possession
of
the
land
,
orthe
city
of
Zarahemla
;
they
have
appointeda
king
over
them
,
and
he
hath
written
unto
the'
king
of
the
Iiamanites
;
in
the
-
which
he
hath
joined
an
alliance'
with
hith
;
in
the
which
allidrice
,
he
hath
[File:420]
agreed
to
maintain
the
eity
of
Zarahemla
,
which
main
:
tenance
he
supposeth
will
enable
the
Lamanites
to
conquer
the
remainder
of
the
land
,
and
he
shall
.
be
placed
king
over
this
people
,
when
they
shall
be
con
.
quered
-
under
the
Lamanites
.
And
now
,
in
your
epistle
you
have
censured
me
;
but
it
mattereth
not
,
Lam
not
angry
,
but
do
rejoice
in
the
greatness
of
your
heart
.
J
,
Pahoran
,
do
not
seek
for
power
,
save
only
to
retain
my
judgment
seat
,
that
I
may
preserve
the
rights
and
the
liberty
of
my
people
-
My
soul
standeth
fast
in
that
liberty
,
in
the
which
God
hath
made
us
free
.
And
now
behold
we
will
resist
wickedness
even
unto
bloodshed
.
We
would
not
shed
the
blood
of
the
Lamanites
,
if
they
would
stay
in
their
own
land
.
We
would
not
,
shed
the
blood
of
our
bretbren
,
if
they
would
not
rise
up
in
rebellion
and
take
the
sword
against
us
.
We
would
subject
ourselves
to
the
yoke
of
bondage
,
if
it
were
requisite
with
the
justice
of
God
,
or
if
he
should
command
us
so
to
do
.
But
behold
he
doth
not
command
us
that
we
shall
subject
ourselves
to
our
enemies
,
but
that
we
should
put
our
trust
in
him
,
and
he
will
deliver
us
.
Therefore
my
beloved
brother
Moroni
,
let
us
resist
evil
;
and
whatsoever
evil
we
cannot
resist
with
our
words
,
yea
,
such
as
rebellions
.
and
dissensions
,
let
us
resist
them
with
our
swords
,
that
we
may
retain
our
freedom
,
that
we
may
rejoice
in
the
great
privilege
of
our
church
and
in
the
cause
of
our
Redeemer
and
our
God
.
Therefore
come
unto
me
speedily
,
with
a
few
of
your
men
,
and
leave
the
remainder
in
the
charge
of
Lehi
and
Teancum
;
give
unto
them
power
to
conduct
the
war
in
that
part
.
of
the
land
,
according
to
the
spirit
of
God
,
which
is
also
the
spirit
of
freedom
which
is
in
them
.
Behold
I
have
senta
few
provisions
unto
them
,
that
they
may
not
perish
until
ye
can
come
unto
me
.
Gather
together
whatsoever
force
ye
can
upon
your
march
hither
,
and
we
will
go
speedily
against
those
dissenters
,
in
the
strength
of
our
,
God
,
accordidg
to
the
faith
which
is
in
us
.
And
we
will
take
possession
of
the
city
of
Zarahemla
,
that
we
may
obtain
more
food
to
send
forth
unto
.
Lehi
and
Teancum
;,
yea
,
we
will
go
forth
against
them
,
in
the
strength
of
the
Lord
,
and
:
we
will
.
put
40
end
to
this
great
iniquity
.
:
:
And
now
,
Moroni
,
I
do
joy
in
receiving
your
epistle
;
for
I
was
somewhat
-
worried
concerning
what
we
should
do
,
whether
:
it
should
be
.
just
in
-
us
to
govagainst
out
brethren
,
But
:
ye
have
.
saidj
except
they
zepenty
the
[File:421]
Lord
hath
commanded
you
that
ye
should
go
against
them
.
.
See
that
ye
strengthen
:
Lehi
and
Teancum
in
the
Lord
:
tell
them
to
fear
not
,
for
God
will
deliver

those
who
stand
fast
in
that
liberty
wherewith
God
hath

mine
epistle
to
my
beloved
brother
Moroni
.
CHAPTER
XXIX
.
_
Anp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Moroni
had
received
this
epistle
,
his
heart
did
take
courage
,
and
,
was
filled
with
exceeding
great
joy
,
because
of
the
faithfulness
of
Palioran
,
that
he
was
not
also
.
a
traitor
to
the
freedom
and
cause
of
his
country
.
But
he
did
also
mourn
exceedingly
,
because
of
the
iniquity
of
those
who
had
-
driven
Pahoran
from
tie
judgment
seat
;
yea
,
in
:
fine
,
because
of
those
who
had
rebelled
against
their
country
and
also
their
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
took
a
small
number
of
men
,
according
to
the
desire
of
Pahoran
,
and
gave
Lehi
and
Teanqum
command
over
Lhe
remainder
of
his
army
,
and
took
his
march
towards
the
land
of
Gideon
.
And
he
did
raise
the
standard
of
liberty
in
whatsoever
place
he
did
-
enter
,
and
gained
whatsoever
force
he
could
in
all
his
march
towards
the
landof
Gideon
.
i
-
Andjit
came
to
pass
that
thousands
did
flock
-
unto
his
standard
,
and
did
take
up
their
,
swords
in
the
defenee
.
of
their
freedom
,
that
they
might
not
come
into
bondage
.
And
thus
when
Moroni
had
gathered
.
tegether
whatsoever
men
he
could
in
all
his
march
,
he
came
tothe
land
of
Gideon
;
and
uniting
.
his
forces
with
that
of
Pahoran
,
they
became
exeeeding
strong
,
even
stronger
than
the
men
of
Pachus
,
who
was
the
king
of
those
dissenters
who
had
driven
out
the
freemen
out
.
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
had
.
taken
possession
-
of
the
land
.
Andiit
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
and
Pahoran
went
down
.
with
their
armies
into
the
land
of
.
Zarahemla
,
and
went
forth
against
the
city
,
and
did
meetthe
men
of
Pachusg
,
insomuch
,
that
,
they
:
did
.
come
to
,-
battle
.
And
bebold
,::
Pachus
.
was
slain

and

prisoners
;
and
Pahoran
was
restored
to'
his
judg
.
ment
seat
..
And
the
men
of
Pachus
received'
their
tr
:
al
,
according
to
the
law
,
and
also
those
king
-
men
who
had
been
taken
and
cast
into
prison
;
and
they
were
executed
according
to
the
law
;
yea
,
those
men
of
Pa

chus
,
and'
those
king
-
men
,
whosoever
would
not
take
up
arms
in
the
defence
of
their
country
,
but
would
fight
against
it
,
were
putto
death
.
And
thus
it
became
expedient
that
this
law
should
be
strictly
obseryed
,
for
the
safety
of
their
country
;
yea
,
and
whosoeyer
was
found
denying
their
freedom
,
was
speedily
executed
according
to
the
law
.
And
thus
ended
the
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
:
Moroni
and
Pahoran
having
restored
peace
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
among
.
their
own
people
,
having
inflicted
death
upon
all
those
who
were
not
true
to
:
the
cause
of
freedom
.
And
it
came
to
:
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
thirty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
Moroni
immediately
caused
that
provisions
should
-
be
sent
,
and
also
an
army
of
six
thousand
men
,
should
be
sent
unto
Helaman
,
to
assist
him
in
preserving
that
part
of
the
land
;
and
he
ak
so
caused
that'an
army
of
six
thousand
men
,
witha
sufficient
quantity
of
food
,
should
be
-
sent
to
the
armies
of
Lehiand
Teancum
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
this
was
done
,
to
fortify
the
land
against
the
Lamanites
,

And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
and
Pahoran
,
leaying
a
large
body
of
men
inthe
land
of
Zarahemla
,
took
their
march
with
a
large
body
of
men
towards
the
land
of
Nephihah
,
being
determined
to
overthrow
the
Lamanites
in
that
city
.
,
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
as
they
were
marching
towards
the
land
,
they
took
a
large
body
of
men
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
slew
many
-
of
them
,
and
.
took
their
provisions
,
and
.
their
-
weapons
of
war
.
And
it
came
to'pass
after
they
had
took
them
,
they
caused
them
to
enter
into
a'covenant
,
that
they
would
no
:
more
take
up
their
weapons
of
war
against
the
Nephites
..
And
when
-
they
had
entered
into
this
covenant
,
they
sent
them
to
dwell
with
the
people
of
Ammon
;
and
they
were
in
numberâ
about
four
thousand
,
who
:
had
not'been'
slain

And
it
:
came'to
.
pass
that
when
they
had
sent
them
away
;
they
pursued
theif'
march
towards
:
the'land
of
NephihahiAind
it
-
came'to
pass
'thatwhen
they
liad
[File:423]
come
to
the
city
Nephihah
,
they
did
pitch
their
tents
in
the
plams
of
-
Nephihah
,
which
is
near
the
city
Ne
phihah
.
Now
Moroni
was
desirous
that
the
Lamanites
should
come
out
to
battie
against
them
,
upon
the
plains
;
bul
the
Lamanites
knowing
of
their
exceeding
great
courage
,
and
beholding
the
greatness
of
their
numbers
,
therefore
they
durst
not
come
out
againsÂ§
them
;
therefore
they
did
not
come
to
battle
in
thag
day
.
And
when
the
night
came
,
Moroni
went
forth
in
the
darkness
-
of
the
night
,
and
came
upon
the
top
of
the
wall
to
spy
out
in
what
part
of
the
city
the
Lay
manites
did
camp
with
their
army
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
on
the
east
,
by
the
entrance
;
and
they
were
all
asleep
.
And
now
Moroni
returned
to
his
army
,
and
caused
that
they
should
prepare
in
haste
strong
cords
and
ladders
,
to
be
let
down
from
the
top
of
the
wall
into
the
inner
part
of
the
wall
.
Andit
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
caused
that
his
men
should
march
forth
and
come
upon
the
top
of
the
wall
,
and
let
themselves
down
into
that
part
of
the
city
,
yea
,
even
on
the
west
,
where
the
Lamanites
did
not
camp
with
their
armies
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
all
let
down
into
the
city
by
night
,
by
the
means
of
their
strong
cords
and
their
ladders
;
thus
-
when
the
morning
came
,
they
were
all
within
the
walls
of
the
city
.
And
now
when
the
Lamanites
awoke
,
and
saw
that
the
armies
of
Moroni
were
within
the
walls
,
they
were
affrizhted
exceedingly
,
insomuch
that
they
did
flee
out
by
the
pass
.
And
now
when
Moroni
saw
that
they
were
fleeing
before
him
,
he
did
cause
that
his
men
should
.
march
forth
against
them
,
and
slew
many
,
and
surrounded
many
:
others
and
took
them
prisoners
;
and
the
remainder
of
them
fled
into
the
land
of
Moroni
,
which
was
in
the
borders
by
theseashore
.
Thus
had
Moroni
and
Pahoran
:
obtained
the
possession
of
the
city
of
Nephihah
,
without
the
loss
of
one
soul
;
and
there
were
ma
ny
of
the
Lamanites
who
were
slain
.
/
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
many
of
the
Lamanites
that
were
prisoners
,
were
desirous
to
join
the
people
of
Ammon
,..
and
become
a
free
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass'that
as
many
as
were
desirous
,
unto
them
it
Was
granted
,
according
to
.
their
desires
;
therefore
:
all
the
prisoners
of
the
:
Lamanites
did
join
the
people
of
Ammon
;
and'did
begin
to
labor
exceedingly
,
'
tilling
[File:424]
the'ground
,
raising
.
all
manner
of
grain
;
and
flocks
;
and
herds
of
every
kind
;
and
thus
were
.
the
Nephites
rel
:
eved
from
a
gress
burthen
;
yea
,
insomuch
that
they
were
relieved
from
all
the
prisoners
of
the
Lamanites
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
,
after
,
he
had
obtained
.
possession
of
the
city
of
Nephihah
,
having
taken
many
prisoners
,
which
did
reduce
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
exceedingly
,
and
having
retained
many
of
the
Nephites
who
had
been
taken
prisoners
,
which
did
strengthen
the
army
of
Moroni
exceedingly
;
;
therefore
Moroni
went
forth
from
the
land
of
Nephihah
to
the
land
of
Lehi
.
,
And
it
cameto
:
pass
that
when
the
Lamanites
saw
that
Moroni
was
comingagainst
them
,
they
wereagain
frightened
,
and
fied
before
the
army
of
Moroni
..
And
it
came
to
pass
.
that
Moroni
and
his
army
did
pursue
them
from
city
to
city
,
until
they
were
met
by
Gehi
and
Teancum
;
and
the
Lamanites
fled
from
Lehiand
Teancum
,
even
down
-
upon
the
:
borders
by
the
seashore
,
until
they
came
1o
the
land
of
:
Moroni
..
Andthe'
armies
of
the
Lamanites
were
all
gathered
together
,
insomuch
that
they
were
all
in
one
body
,
in
the
land
:
of
Moroni
.
Now
Ammoron
,
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
,
was
also
.
with
them
.
-
+
And
it
-
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
,
'and
Lehi
,
and
Teancum
,
did
encamp
with
.
their
armies
round
about
in
the
borders
of
the
land
of
Moroni
;
insomuch
that
the
Lamanites
-
were
encircled
-
about
in
the
borders
by
the
wilderness
,
'on
the
south
,
and
in
the
.
borders
by
the
wilderness
,
on
the
east
;
and
:
thus
they
did
encamp
for
the
night
;:
For
behold
,
the
Nephites
and
the
Lamanites
also
,
were
weary
-
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
march
;
therefore
they
.
did
not
.
resolve
upon
.
any
stratagem
in
the
night
time
,
save
it
were
Teancum
:
for
he
was
exceeding
angry
with
Ammoron
,
insomuch
that
he
-
considered
that'
.
Ammoron
,
and
Amalickiah
.
his
brother
,
had
been
the
cause
of
this
great
-
and
lasting
war
between
them
.
and
the
Lamanites
,
which
had
been
the
cause
.
of
so
much
war
and
bloodshed
,
yea
,
and'so
much
famine
;

And'it
came
to
-
pass
that
Teancum
in
his
anger
did
go
forth
into
the
.
camp
of
:
the
Lamanites
,
:
and
.
did
let
himself
down
oyer
-
the
walls

of
the
city

And
he

went

from

,
insomuch
that

and
:

cast

him

But

servant
,
before
he
died
,
insomuch
that
they
did
pursue
Teancum
,
and
slew
.
him
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Lehi
and
Moroni
knew
-
that
'Teancum
was
dead
,
they
were
exceeding
sorrowful
:
for
behold
,
he
had
been
a
-
man
who
.
had
fought
.
valiantly
for
his
country
,
yea
,
a
true
friend
to
liberty
;.
and
he
had
suffered
very
many
exceeding
sore
afilictions
..
But
behold
,
he
was
dead
,
and
had
gone
the
way
ofall
the
earth
.,
ea
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
Moroni
marched
forth
on
the
morrow
,
and
came
upon
the
Lamanites
,
insomuch
that
they
did
slay
them
with
a
great
slaughter
;
and
they
did
drive
them
outof
the
land
;
.
and
they
did
flee
,
even
that
they
-
did
not
return
at
that
-
time
against
the
Nephites
.
.
And
thus
ended
the
thirty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people'
of
Nephi
;
and
thus
they
had
had
wars
,
and
bloodsheds
,
and
famine
,
and
affliction
,
for
the
space
of
many
years
.
And
there
had
been
murders
,
and
contentions
,
and
dissensions
;
and
all
manner
of
iniquity
among
the
people
of
Nephi
;
nevertheless
,
for
the
righteous'
sake
,
yea
,
because
of
the
prayers
of
the
righteous
,
they
were
spared
.
But
behold
,
because
of
the
exceeding
great
length
of
the
war
between
the
.
Nephites
and
the
Lamanites
,
many
had
become
hardened
,
because
.
of
the
exceeding
great
length
of
the
war
;
and
many
were
softened
,
because
of
their
afflictions
,
insomuch
that
they
did
humoe
sobmaeises
before
God
,.
even
in
the
depth
of
humility
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
Moroni
had
fortified
those
parts
of
the
land
which
were
)
most
exposed
to
the
Lamanites
,
until
they
were
sufficiently
strong
,
he
returned
:
to

the
.
ciy
of
Zarahemla
;
and
also
Helaman
teturned
:.
to
the
.
place
of
his
inheritance
;.
and
there
was
once
more
.
peace
established
among
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
-
Moroni
-
yielded
up
the
command
.
of
,
his
.
armies
into
,
the
hands
of
bis
son
;
whose
name
was
Moronihah

and
he
,
retired
to
his
own
house
that
she
might
:
spend
the
.
remainder
of
his
days
in
peace
.
-
And
Pahoran
did
return
.
to
his
judgment
seat
;
and
.
Helainan
did
take

to
,
preach
unto
the
people
the

word
of
God
:
for
because
of
so
many

.
and
contentions
,
it/had
become
expedient
that
a

regulation
should
..
be
made
again

;
therefore
Helaman
and
;
hig
-
brethren
went
forth
,
\and
did
declare
;
the
word
.
of
God
with
,
much
power
;
unto
the
:
convincing
of
many
people
of
their
wickedness
,
which
did
cause
[File:426]
them
:
to
repent
-
of
their
sins
,.
and
tobe
baptized
unto
the
Lord
.
their
God

a
:
And
it
came
to
pass
:
that
they
did
establish
again
the
church
of
God
;
throughout
all
the
land
;
yea
,
and
eogulntonanae
:
made
concerning
the
law
.
And
their
judges
,
and
their
chief
judges
were
chosen
.
And
the
people
of
Nephi
began
to
prosper
again
in
the
land
,
and
began
to
multiply
and
to
wax
exceeding
strong
again
in
the
land
.
And
they
began
to
grow
exceeding
rich
;
but
notwithstanding
their
riches
,
or
their
strength
,
or
their
prosperity
,
they
were
not
lifted
up
in
the
pride
of
their
eyes
;
neither
were
they
slow
to
remember
the
Lord
their
God
;
but
they
did
humble
themselves
exceedingly
before
him
;
yea
,
they
did
remember
how
.
great
things
the
Lord
had
done
for
them
,
that
he
had
delivered
them
from
death
,
and
from
bonds
,
and
from
prisons
,
and
from
all
manner
of
afflictions
;
and
he
had
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
.

to

inthe
commencement
of
the
thirty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of

judges
over
the
people
of

,
that
Shiblon
:
took
possession
of
those
sacred
things
which
had
been
delivered
unto
Helaman
by
Alma
;
and
he
was

man

and
he
did

before

and
he
did

.
And
thus
ended
the
thirty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that'
im
the
thirty
and
seventh
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
there
was
t
large
company
-
of
men
,
ever
to
the
amount
of
five
thousand
en
fo
shundred
:
men
;:
with
their
iwives
-
and
[File:427]
their
children
;
departed
out
of
the
-
land
:
of
Zarahemla
,
into
the
Jand
which
wag
northward
;
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Hagoth
,
he
being
an
exceeding
curious
mam
,
therefore
.
he
went
forth
and
built
him
an
exceeding
large
ship
,
on
the
borders
of
the
land
Bountiful
,
by
the
land
Desolation
,
and
launched
it
forth
into
the
west
sea
,
by
the
narrow
neck
which
led
into
the
land
northward
.
And
behold
,
there
were
many
of
the
Nephites
who
did
enter
therein
,
and
did
sail
forth
with
much
provisions
,
and
also
many
women
and
children
;
and
they
took
their
course
northward
.
And
thus
ended
the
thirty
and
seventh
year
.
And
in
the
thirty
and
eighth
year
,
this
man
built
other
ships
.
And
the
first
ship
did
also
return
,
and
many
more
people
did
enter
into
it
;
and
they
also
took
much
provisions
,
and
set
out
.
again
to
the
land
northward
.
And
it
eame
to
pass
that
they
were
never
heard
of
more
.
And
we
suppose
that
they
were
drowned
up
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
one
other
ship
algo
did
sail
forth
;
and
whither
she
did
go
,
we
know
not
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
ear
,
there
were
many
people
who
went
forth
into
the
and
northward
.
And
thus
ended
the
thirty
and
eighth
year
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
Shiblon
died
also
,
and
Corianton
had
gone
forth
to
the
land
northward
,
ina
ship
,
to
carry
forth
provisions
unte
the
people
who
had
gone
forth
into
that
land
;
therefore
it
became
expedient
for
Shiblon
to
confer
those
sacred
things
,
before
his
death
,
upon
the
son
of
Helaman
,
who
was
called
Helaman
,
being
called
after
the
name
of
his
father
.
Now
behold
,
all
those
engravings
which
were
in
the
possession
of
Helaman
,
were
written
and
sent
forth
among
the
children
of
men
throughout
all
the
land
,
saveit
were
those
parts
whch
had
been
commanded
by
Alma
should
not
go
forth
.
Nevertheless
these
things
were
to
be
kept
sacred
,
and
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
another
;
therefore
,
in
this
year
,
they
had
been
conferred
upon
Helaman
,
before
the
death
of
Shiblon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
also
in
this
year
,
that
there
were
some
ters
wha
had
gone
forth
unto
the
Lamanites
;
and
they
werestirred
up
again
to
anger
against
theN
ephites
.
And
also
in
this
same
year
,
they
:
came
down
witha
Humerous
army
:
to
war
against
the
people
of
Moronihah
,
or
against
the
army
of
Moronihah

the
which
they'
were
beaten
,
and
driven
back
again
to
their
own

lands
,
suffering
great
loas

.
And
thus
ended
the'thirty
and
ninth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
ple
of

And
thus

part

that
were
desirous
that

should

was

exceeding
wroth
;
therefore
he
was
about
to
flatter
away
those
people'to
rise
up
in
rebellion
against
their
brethren
,
..
:
And
it
came
to

as
he
was
about
to
do
this
,
behold
,
he
was
taken
,
and
was
tried
according

the
voice
of

condemned

for
he
had

raised
up

rebellion

sought

when
those

,
saw
that
he
was
condemned
unto
death

therefore
:
they

were
angry
;

behold
,
they
sent
forth
one
Kishkumen

even
to
the
judgment
seat
of
Pahoran

murdered
Paboran
as
he
sat
upon

he
was
pursued

behold

so

was
the
flight
of
Kishkumen

no

overtake

him

And

he
went
unto

that
sent

they

entered

into
a

swearing

Maker
,
that

no

therefore
Kishkumen

was
not
known
among
the
people

,
for
he
was
in

at
the
time
that
he
murdered
Pahoran

And
Kishkumen

that

insomuch
with

and
also
with
his
great
wisdom
,
that
by
sending
him'
forth
,
he
.
should
gain
power
over
the
Nephites
;
there
:
fore
he
.
did
stir
them
up
to
anger
,
and
he
did
gather
together
his
armies
,
and
he
did
appoint
Coriantumr
to
be
their
leader
,
and
did
cause
that
they
should
march
down
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
to
battle
against
the
Nephites
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
because
of
so
much
contention
and
so
much
difficully
in
the
government
,
that
they
had
not
kept
sufficient
guards
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
for
they
had
supposed
-
that
the
Lamanites
durst
not
come
into
the
heart
of
their
lands
to
attack
that
great
city
Zarahemla
.,
But
it
came
to
pass
that
Coriantumr
did
march
forth
at
the
head
of
his
numer
:
ous
host
,
and
came
upon
the
inhabitantsof
the
city
,
and
their
march
was
with
such
exceeding
great
speed
,
that
there
was
no
time
tor
the
Nephites
to
gather
together
their
armies
;
therefore
Coriantumr
did
cut
down
the
watch
by
the
entrance
of
the
city
,
and
did
march
forth
with
his
whole
army
into
the
city
,
and
they
did
slay
every
one
who
did
oppose
them
,
insomuch
that
they
did
take
possession
of
the
whole
city
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Pacumeni
,
who
was
the
chief
judge
,
did
flee
before
Coriantumr
,
even
to
the
walls
of
the
city
.
-
Andit
came
to
pass
that
Coriantumr
did
smite
him
against
the
wall
,
insomuch
that
he
died
..
And
thus
ended
the
days
of
Pacumeni
.
And
now
when
Coriantumr
saw
that
he
was
in
possession
of
the
ity
of
Zarahemla
,
and
saw
that
the
Nephites
had
fled
before
them
,
and
were
slain
,
and
were
taken
,
and
were
east
into
prison
;
and
that
.
hehad
obtained
the
possession
of
the
strongest
hold
in
all
the
land
,
his
heart
took
courage
,
insomuch
that
he
was
about
to
go
forth
against
all
the
land
.
And
now
he
did
not
tarry
in
the
'
land
of
Zarahemla
,
but
he
did
march
forth
with
a
large
army
,
even
towards
the
city
of
Bountiful
;
for
it
wae
his
determination
to
go
forth
and
cut
his
way
through
with
the
sword
,
that
he
might
obtain
the
north
parts
of
the
land
;
and
supposin
that
their
greatest
strength
was
in
the
center
of
the
land
,
therefore
he
did
march
forth
,
giving
them
no
time
to
assemble
themselves
together
,
save
it
were
in
small
bodies
;
and
in
this
manner
they
did
fall
upon
them
and
cut
them
down
to
the
earth
.
But
nohold
,
this
march
of
Coriantumr
through
the
center
of
the
land
,
gave
Moronihah
great
adyantage
over
them
,
notwithstanding'the
preatness'
of
the
[File:431]
number
of
the
Nephites'
who
.
were
.
slain
;
for
hehold
,
Moronihalt
had
supposed
that
the
Lamanites
durst
not
come
into
the
center
of
the
land
,
but
that
they
:
would
attack
the
cities
round
about
;
in
,
the
borders
as
.
they
had
hitherto
.
done
;
therefore
Moronihah
.
had
caused
that
their
strong
armies
.
should
maintain
those
parts
round
about
by
the
borders
.
But
behold
,
the
Lamanites
were
-
not
frightened
according
to
his
desire
,
but
they
had
come
into'the
center
of
the
land
,
and
had
taken
the
capital
city
,
which
was
the
city
.
of
Zarahemla
,
and
were
marching
through
.
the
most
capital
,
parts
of
the
land
,
slayiag
the
people
with
a
great
slaughter
,
both
men
,
women
and
children
,
taking
possession
of
many
-
cities
and
of
many
-
strong
holds
.
But
when
Moronihah
had
discovered
this
,
he
immediately
sent
forth
.
Lehi
with
an
army
round
about
to
head
them
,
before
they
.
should
come
to
the
land
Bountiful
.
And
thus
.
he
did
;
and
he
.
did
,
head
them
,
before
they
came
to
the
land
Bountiful
,
and
gave
unto
them
battle
,
insomuch
that
they
began
to
retreat
back
towards
the
land
of
Zarahemla
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Moronihah
did
.
head
them
in
their
retreat
,
and
did
give
unto
them
battle
insomuch
that
it
became
an
exceeding
bloody
battle
;,
yea
,
many
were
slam
;
and
among
the
number
who
were
slain
,
Coriantumr
was
-
also
found

And

now
behold
the
Lamanites
could
not

neither
on

nor
onthe
south

nor
on

Lamanites
who
had
been
taken
prisoners
:
should
depart
out
of
the
land
in
peace
,
And
thus
ended
the
forty
and
first
year
of

of

.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
forty
and
second
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
affer
Moronihah
had
established
again
peace
between
the
Nephites
and
the
LamanAtes
,
behold
there
was
no
one
tofill
the
judgment
seats
therefore
there
began
.
to
be
.
a
contention
again
among
the
People
jgoncenting
who
should
fill
the
judgment
Seat
,
it
came
.
to
pass
.
that
Helaman
,
who
was
&
[File:432]
the'son
of
Helaman
,
was
appointed
to
fill'the
jadgment
seat
,
by
the'
voice
of
the'
people
;:
but
behold
,
Kishkumen
,
who
.
had
-
murdered
Pahoran
,
did
lay
wait
to
destroy
Helaman
also
;
and
-
he
wasupheld
by
his
band
,
who
had
entered
intoa
covenant
that
no
one
should
know
his
wickedness
;:
for
there
was
one
Gadianton
who
was
exceeding
expert
in
many
words
;
and
also
in
his
craft
,
to
-
carry
on
the
secret
Work
of
murder
and
of
robbery
;
therefore
he
became
the
leader
of
the
band
of
Kishkumen
;
therefore
he
did
flatter
them
,
and
aleo
Kishkumen
,
that
if
they
would
place
him
in
the
judgment
seat
,
he
would
grant
.
unto
those
who
belonged
to
his
band
that
they
should
be
placed
in
power
and
authority
among
the
people
;
therefore
Kishkumen
sought
to
destroy
Helaman
.
And
it
came
to
pass
as
he
went
forth
towards
the
judgment
seat
,
to
destroy
Helaman
,
behold
one
of
tlie
servants
of
Helaman
,
having
been
out
by
night
,
and
having
obtained
,
through
:
disguise
,
a
knowledge
of
those
plang
which
had
been
laid
by
this
band
te
destroy
Helaman
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
met
Kishkumen
,
and
he
gave
unto
him
a
sign
;
therefore
Kishkumen
made
known
unto
him
the
object
of
his
desire
,
desiring
that
he
would
conducthim
to
the
judgment
seat
,
that
he
might
murder
Helaman
;
and
when
the
servant
of
Helaman
had
-
known
all
the
heart
of
Kishkumen
,
and
how
that
it
was
his
object
to
murder
,
and
also
that
it
was
the
object
of
all
those
who
belonged
to
his
band
,
to
murder
,
and
torob
,
and
:
to
gain'
power
,
(
and
this
was
their'secret
plan
,
and
their
combination
,)
the
servant
of
Helaman
saith
unto
Kishkumen
,
let
us
go
forth
unto
the
judgment
seat
.
Now
this
did
please
Kishkumen
exceedingly
,
for
he
did
suppose
that
he
should
accomplish
his
design
;
but
behold
,
the
servant
of
Helaman
,
as
they'were
going
forth
unto
the
judgment
seat
,
did
stab
Kishkumen
,
even
to
the
heart
that
he
fell
dead
without
a
:
groan
.
And
he
ran
and
.
told
Helamanall
the
things
which
he
bad
seen
,
and
heard
,
and
done
.

And
it
came
to
pass
that
Helaman
did
send
forth
to
take
this
band'ofrolibers
and
secret
murderers
,
that
they
might
be
executed
according
to
the
law
.
But
behold
,
when
Gadianton
had
found
that
Kishkumen
did
not
return}
he
fearedlest
that
he
should
bedestroyed
?
therefore
he
caused
that
his
band
should
follow
him
.
And
they
took
their
figlit
out
ofthe
land
,
by's
secret
way
,
intotthe
wilderness
;
and
thus
when
Hele

sent
forth
to

take
them
,
they

could
no

Axp
now
:
it
came
to
pass
in

of
the

of
the

,
there
was
no

contention
among

save
.
it
were
a
little
pride
whieh
was
in

,
which

did
cause

dissensions
among

,
which
affairs
were
settled
in

ending
;
of

the
forty

.
And
there
was
no

among

people
in

;
neither
was

there
much

And
it
came
to
pass
in

forty

sixth
,
yea
,
there
.
were
much
:
contentions
and
many
dissensions
;
in
the
which
there
.
were
an
exceeding
great
many
who
,
departed
out
of
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
went
forth
unto
the
Jand
northward
,
to
.
inherit
the
land
;
and
they
didtravel
to
an
exceeding
great
distance
,
insomuch
that
they
came
to
large'
bodies
of
water
,
and
.
many
.
rivers
;
yea
,
and
even
they
did
spread
forth
into
all
parts
of
the
land
,
into
-
whatever
parts
it
had
not
been
rendered

And
now
,
no

was
desolate

saveit
were
for

but
because
ofthe
greatness

,
it
,
was
called

And

,
nevertheless
the
people

went

forth
;
became

the

did

And
it
came
to
pass
as
timber
was
exceeding
scarce
in
the
land
northward
,
they
-
did
send
forth
much
by
the
way
of
shipping
;
and
thus
they
did
enable
the'
people
in
the
land
northward
,
that
they
might
build
many
cities
,
both
of
wood
and
:
of
cement
.
And
it
came
to

that
there
were
many
of

who
were
Lamanices

,
did

there
are
many
books

many
records
of
every
kind

they
have
been

by

inthe

nevertheless
,
Helaman
did

with
justice

;
yea
he
did
observe
to
keep
the
statutes
,
and
the
judgments
,
and
the
commandments
of
God
;
and
he
did
do
that
which
was

in

sight
,
of
God
continually
;
and
he
did
walk
after

ways
of

insomuch
that
he
did
prosper
in

-
And
it
came
to

he

they
began
to

And
itcame
to

that

And
.
it
came
fo
pass
in
the
forty
and
ninth
year
of
.
the
reign
.
of
the
judges
,
there
was
continual
peace
established
in
the
land
,
all
save
itawere
the
secret
combinations
which
Gadianton
the
robber
had
-
established
,
in
.
the
more
settled
parts
of
the
land
,
which
at
that
time
were
not
known
unto
.
those
who
.
were
at
the
head
of
government
;
therefore
they
were
not
destroyed
out
of
the
land
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
same
year
,.
there
was
exceeding
great
prosperity
.
in
the
church
,
ingomuch
that
there
were
thousands
who
did
join
themselves
unto
.
the
church
,
and
were
baptized
unto
repentance
;
and
sa
great
was
the
prosperity
of
the
church
,
and
.
so
.
many
ihe
blessings
which
were
,
poured
out
up
.
on
the
people
,
that
even
the
high
priests
and
the
teach
ers'were
themselves
astonished

And
it
came
to

that
the
work
of

Lord
did
prosper

baptizing

Inthe
sincerity

,
thus
we
see
that
the

is
open
unto

all
,
even
to
those
who
will
-
believe
on
the

of

,

is

yea
,
we
see
that

with

,
and
with

to
go
no

out
.
-
And
in
this
year
there
were
continual
rejoicing
in
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
and
in
.
all
the
regions
round
about
,
even
in
all
the
land
which
was'
possessed
by
-
the
Nephites
..
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
peace
and
exeeeding
great
joy
in
the
remainder
of
the
forty
and
ninth
year
;
yea
,
and
also
there
was
continual
peace
and
great
-
joy
in
the
fiftieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
.
And
in
.
the
fifty
and
first
yearof
.
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
there
was
peace
also
,
saveit
were
the
pride
which
began
to
enter
into
-
the
church
;
not
into
the
church
of
God
,
but
into
the
hearts
of
the
people
who
professed
to
belong
to
the
church
of
God
;
and
they
were
lifted
up
in
pride
,
even
to
the
persecution
of
many
of
their
brethren
..
Now
this'
was
a
great
evil
,
which
did
cause
the
more
hunible
part
of
the
people
to
suffer
great
persecutions
,
and
to
wade
through
much
affliction
;
nevertheless
,
they
did
fast
and
pray
oft
;
and
did
wax
stronger'and
stronger
in
their
humility
,
and
firmer
and
firmer
in
the
faith
of
Christ

unito'the

even
to

the

which
sanctification

cometh
because
of

the

in

they

msomuch
that
in

of

were
driven
even
into

and
there
they
did
fortify
against

from

,
even
unto
the
east
:
it
being
a
day's

journey
for

,,
on
the
line
which
they
had
fortified

stationed
their

thus
those
dissenters
of

Nephites
,
with
:
the
help
of
2
numerous
army
of
the
.
Lamanites
,
had
obtained
all
the
possession
of
the
Nephites
which
was
in
the
land
southward

all
.
this
was
done
in
the
fifty
and

eighth
and
ninth

years
of
the
reign
of

.
And
it
came
:
to

in

sixtieth
year
of
the
reign
of

judges
,
Moronihah
did
succeed
with
his
armies
,
in
obtaining
many
parts
of
the
land
;,
yea
,
they
retained
many
cities
which
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites

;
.
And
it
came
to

in

sixty

reign

they
succeeded

this
great
loss
of

the
great
slaughter
which
Was

would
not

have
happened
,
had
it
not
been
for
their
wickedness

:
their
abomination
which
was

among
them
;
yea
,
and
it
was
among
those
also
who
professed
.
to
belong
to
the
church
of
God
;
and
it
was
because
of
the
pride
of
their
hearts
,
because
of
their
exceeding
riches
,
yea
,
it
was
because
of
their
oppression
to
.
the
poor
,
withholding
their
food
from
the
hungry
,
withholding
their
clothing
from
the
.
naked
,
and
smniting
their
humble

upon

the

,
making
a
mock
of
that
which
was
sacred

denying

therefore
they
did
not

but
were
afflicted

and
smitten
,
and
driven
before
the
Lamanites
,
until
they
had
lost
possession
of
almost
all

And
it
came

they

And
it
came
to

that
Moronihaly
could

obtain
no

therefore
they
did
abandon

obtain
the

for
so
numerous
were
the
Lamanites
that
:
in
became
impossible
:
for

to
obtain
more

And
it
came
to
pass
because
of
the
greatness
of
the
number
of
the
Lamanites
,
the
Nephites
were
in
great
fear
,
lest
they
should
be'
overpowered
,
and
trodden
down
,
and
slain
,
and
destroyed
;
yea
,
they
began
to
remember
the
prophecies
:
of
Alma
,
and
also
.
the
words
of
Mosiah
;
and
they
saw
:
that
they'had
been
a
stiff
necked
people
;
and
:
that
they
had
sev
at
:
nought
the
eommandnients
of
God
;
and
that'
they
-
had
:
altered
and

the

of

that
which
the
Lord
commanded
him

unto

thus

that

had
become
corrupted

and
that
they
had
becomes
wicked
people
,
insomuch
that
they
were
wicked
!
even
like
unto
the
Lamanites
..
And
because
of
theif
iniquity
,
the
church
had
began'
to
dwindle
;!
aiid'
they
began
:
to
:
disbelieve
in
the
spirit
of
prophecy
;
andvin
the
spirit
of
revel
tion
:
and
,
the

judgments
of
God
did'stare
them
in

faces
.
And
-
they'saw
that'they
had

it

withdrawn
:
from
them
,
because
:
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
dothnot
dwell
in
unholy
temples
;
therefore
the
Lord
did
cease
to
-
preserve
them
by
his
miraculous
and
matchless
power
,
for
they
had
fallen
into
a
state
of
unbelief
and
awful
wickedness
;
and
they
saw
that
,
the
Lamanites
were
more
exceeding
.
numerous
than
they
,
and
except
they
should
cleaye
unto
the
Lord
their
God
,
they
must
unavoidably
perish
.
For
behold
,
they
saw
that
the
strength
of
the
Lamanites
was
as
greatas
their
strength
,
even
man
for
man
.
And
thus
had
they
fallen
into
this
great
transgression
;
yea
,
thus
had

And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
same
year
,
behold
,
Nephi
delivered
:
up
the
judgment
seat
,
to'a
man
whose
name
was
Cezoram

For
as
their
laws
and
-
their
governments
were
established
by
the
voice
of
the
people
,
and
they
who'chose
evil
were
more
numerous
than
they
who
chose

good
,
therefore
they
were
ripening
for
destruction
,
for
the
laws
had
become
corrupted
;
.
yea
,
and
this
.
was
not
all
;
they
were'a
stiffnecked
people
,
insomuch
that
they
could
not
be
governed
by
the
law
nor
justice
,
save
it
were
to
their
destruction
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi

had
become
weary
,
because
of

:

yielded

up

words

spake

And

to
repair
unto

the'wrongs
Which
they
had
done
.
And
it
:
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
and
Lehi
did
preach
unto
the
:
Lamanites
with
sach
great
power
and
authority
,
for
they
had
power
and
authority
given
unto
them
that
they
might

speak>
and
theyalso
had
what
they
should
speak
;
given
unto
them
;
therefore
they
did
speak
unto
the
great
astonishment
of
the
Lamanites
,
to
the
con
vincing
them
,
insomuch
that
there
were
eight
thou
sand
of
the
Lamanites
who
were
in
the
land
of
Zara
hemla
and
round
about
,
baptized
unto
repentance
,
and
wereconvineed
of
the
wickedness
of
the
traditions
of
their
fathers
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
and
Lehi
did
proeeed
from
thence
to
go
to
the
land
of
Nephi
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
taken
by
an
army
:
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
cast
into
prison
;
yea
,
even
in
that
:
same
prison
in
which
Ammon
and
his
brethren
were
cast
by
the
servants
of
Limhi
.
And
after
they
had
been
cast
into
prison
many
days
without
food
,
behold
,
they
went
forth
intothe
prison
to
take
them
,
thatthey
might
slay
them
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
and
Lehi
were
encircled
about
as
if
by
fire
,
even
insomuch
that
they
durst
not
lay
their
hands
upon
them

for
fear
,
lest
they
should
be
burned

Nevertheless

Ne

and
Lehi
were
not
burned
;
and
they
were
as
standing
in
the
midst
of
fire
,
and
were
not
burned
:
And'
when
they
saw
that
they
were
encircled
about
witha
pillar
of'fire
,
and
:
that
it
burned
them
not
,
their
hearts'
did
take
courage

For
they
saw
that
the'
Lamanites
dust
not

lay
their
hands
:
upon
them
;
neither
duret
they
come
near
unto
them

stood
as

they
were
struck
damb
with
amazement

And
it
came
to

benold
the

wicked
again

For
:

the

them
so

with

,
that
they
had
not

to

insomuch
that
they
had
become
exceeding
wicked
;
yea
,
the
more
part
of
them
had
turned
out
of
the
way
of
righteousness
,
andvdid'
trample
under
their
feet
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
did
turn
unto
their
own'
ways
,
and
did
build
up
unto
themselves
idols
of
their
goll
and
their
silver

ee
And
it
came
to
pass
,
thatall
these
iniquities
did
come
unto'
them
,
in
the
space
of
not
many
years
,
insomuch
that
atnore
part
of
it
had
come
unto
them
in
the
sixty
and
seyenth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
oyer
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
they
-
did
grow
in
their
iniquities
,
inthe
sixty
and
eighth
year
alsg
,
to
the
great
sorrow
and
lamentation
of
the
righteous
.
And
thus
we
-
see
that
the
Nephites
did
begin
to
dwindle
in
unbelief
,
and
grow
in
wickedness
and
abominaticns
,
while
the
Lamanites
began
to
,
grow
exceedingly
in
.
the
,
knowledge
oftheir
God
;
yea
,
they
did
begin
to
keep
his
.
statutes
aud
commandments
,
and
to
walk
in
truth
and
uprightness
before
him
.
And
thus
we
see
that
.
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
began
to
withdraw
from
the
Nephites
,
because
of
the
wickedness
and
the
hardness
of
their
.
hearts
.
And
.
thus
we
see
that
-
the
Lord
began
to
.
pour
out
his
spirit
upon
.
the
.
Lamnanites
,
because
of
their
easiness
and
willingness
to
believe

word

.
.
Andit
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
hunt
the
band
of

of
Gadianton

and
they
did
preach

wicked

imsomuch
that

was

,
if

God
threatens

Samuel
,
a
Lamanite
,
prophesies
unto
the
Nepltites
.
Benorp
,
now
it
came
to
pass
in
the
sixty
and
ninth
ear
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
the
ephites
,
that
Nephi
,
the
son
of
Helaman
returned
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
from
the
land
northward
:
for
he
had
been
forth
among
the
people
who
were
in
the
land
northward
,
and
did
preach
the
word
of
God
unto
them
,
and
did
prophesy
many
things
unto
them
;
and
they
did
reject
all
his
words
,
insomuch
that
he
could
not
stay
among
them
,
but
returned
again
unto
the
land
of
his
nativity
;
and
seeing
the
people
in
a
state
of
such
awful
wickedness
,
and
those
Gadianton
robbers
filling
the
judgment
seats
;
having
usurped
the
power
and
authority
of
the
land
;
laying
aside
the
commandinents
of
God
,
and
not
in
the
least
aright
before
him
:
doing
no
justice
unto
the
children
of
men
;
condemning
the
righteous
because
of
their
righteousness
;
letting
the
guilty
and
the
wicked
go
unpuished
,
because
of
their
money
;
and
moreover
,
to
be
held
in
office
at
the
head
of
government
,
to
rule
and
do
according
to
their
wills
,
that
they
might
get
gain
andglory
of
the
world
;
and
moreover
that
they
might
the
more
easy
commit
adultery
,
and
steal
,
and
kill
,
-
and
do
according
to
their
own
wills
.
Now
this
great
iniquity
had
come
upon
the
Nephites
,
in
the
space
of
not
:
many
years
;
and
when
Nephi
saw
it
,
his
heart
was
swollen
with
sorrow
within
his
breast
:
and
he
did
exclaim
in
the
agony
of
his
soul
,-
O
that
!
could
have
had
my
days
,
in
the
days'when
my
father
Nephi
first
came
out
of
the
Jand
of
Jerusalem
,
tht
!
eould
have
joyed
with
him
in
the
promised
land
:
thea
were
his
people
easy
to
be
entreated
,
firm
to
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
and
slow
to
be
led
to
do
inl
quity
;.
and
they
were
quick
to
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
if
my
days
could
have
been
in
them
days
,
then
would
-
my
soul
have
shad
joy
in
the
righteousness
of
my
brethren
.
.
But
behold
,
I
am
consigned
that
these
.
are
my
days
,
and
that
my
soul
shall
be
[File:449]
filled
with
sorrow
,
because
of
this
)
the
wickedness
of
my
brethren
.
And
behold
,
now
it
came
to
pass
that
it
was
upon
a
tower
,
which
was
in
the
garden
of
Nephi
,
which
was
by
the
highway
which
led
to
the
chief
market
,
which
was
in
the
city
of
Zarahemla
;
therefore
,
Nephi
had
bowed
himself
upon
the
tower
which
was
in
his
garden
,
which
tower
was
also'
near
unto
the
garden
gate
which
Jed
by
the
highway
.
And
it
came
,
to
-
pass
that
there
were
certain
men
passing
by
,
and
saw
Nephi
as
he
was
pouring
out
his
soul
unto
God
upon
the
tower
,
and
they
ran
and
told
the
people
what
they
had
seen
,
and
the
people
came
together
in
multitudes
that
they
might
know
the
cause
of
so
great
niourning
for
the
wickedness
.
of
the
people
.
And
now
when
Nephi
arose
he
beheld
the
multitudes
of
people
who
had
gathered
together
.
And
it
came
.
to
pass
that
he
opened
bis
mouth
and
said
unto
them
,
behold
,
why
have
ye
gathered
yourselves
together
?.
That
I
may
tell
you
of
your
iniquities
?
Yea
,
because
I
haye
.
got
upon
my
tower
,
that
might
pour
out
my
soul
unto
my
God
,
because
of
the
exceeding
sorrow
of
.
my
heart
,
which
is
because
of
your
iniquities
?
And
because
of
my
mourning
and
lamentation
,
ye
have
gathered
yourselves
together
,
and
do

and
ye
have
great
need

yea
,
ye
had
ought

because
ye
are
given
away
,
that
the
devil
has
got
so
great
hold
upon
your
hearts
;
yea
,
how
could
ye
have
given
away
to
the
enticing
of
him
who
is
seeking
to
hurl
away
your
souls
down
to
everlasting
misery

O

Turn

unto

the

Why

It
is
because
you
have
hardened
your
hearts
;
yea
,
ye
will
nat
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
good
shepherd
;
yea
,
ye
have
provoked
him
to
anger
against
you

And
behold
,
instead
of
gathering
you
;
;
except
ye
will
repent
,
behold
he
shall
scatter
you
forth
that
ye

how
could
you
have
forgotten

in

it

to

And
now
it
-
eame
to
pass
that
when
Nephi
had
.
said
these
words
,
behold
there
were
men
who
:
were
judges
,
who
also
belonged
to
.
the
secret

band
of
Gadianton
,
and
they
were
angry
;
and
theycried
out
against
him
,
saying
unto
the
people
,
why
do
ye
not
seize
upon
this
man
and
bring
him
.
forth
,
that
he
may

behold

Nephi'had'
spoken

thein
concerning

the
corruptness

;
yea
;
many'
thingsdid
Nephi

concerning
their'
secret
works
of

;
nevertheless
they
durst
not'lay
their
,
own
hands
upon
him
;
for
they
feared'the
people
;
lest
:
they
-
should
ery

therefore
they
did
ery
-
unto
the
people
,
saying
,
why
do
ye
suffer
this
man
to
revile
dgainst

?
For
behold
,
he
doth
condemn
all

people
,
even
unto

yea

and
also
that

he
has
:
testified
aright
unto
us
concerning
our
iniquities
.
And
behold
they
are
-
many
;
and
he
knoweth
as
well
all
things
which
shall
befal
us
as
he
knoweth
of
out
iniquities
;
yea
,
and
behold
if
he
had'not
been
-
a
prophet
he
cotild
not'
have
testified
concerning'
those
things
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
those
people
who
sought
to
destroy
Nephi
,
were
compelled
because
of
their
fear
,
that
they
did
not
lay
their
hands
on
him
.
'Pherefore
he
began
again
to
speak
unto
them
,
seeing
that
he
had
gained
favor'in
the
eyes
of
some
;
insomuch
that
the
remainder
of
them
did
fear
.
Therefore
he
was
constrained
to
speak
more
unto
them
,
saying
,
behold
my
brethren
,
have
ye
not
read
that
God
gave
power
unto
one
man
,
even
Mosat
to
smite
upon
the
waters
of
the
Red
Sea
,
and
.
they
parted
hither
and
thither
,
insomuch
that
the
Israelites
,
who
were
our
fathers
,
came
through
upon
dry'ground
,-
and
the
-
waters
closed
upon
the
armies
of
the
Egyptians
,
and
swallowed'them
up
?
~
And
now
behold
,
if
God
,
gaye
unto
this
man
such
power
,
then
why
should
ye
dispute
among
yourselves
,
andsay
that
he
hath
given
unto
me
no
power
whete
-.
by
I
may
know
concerning
the
judgments
that
shall
come
upon
.
you
except'
ye
repent
?
But
behold
,.
ye
not
only
deny
my
words
,
but
ye
also
deny
all
the
words
which
hath
been
spoken
by
our
fathers
,
and'
also
the
Words
which
wereispoken
by
this
man
,
Moses
;
who
had
atieh
gteat
power
given
unto
him
;.
yea
,
the
words
whichhe
hath
spoken'
concernmg'the
coming
:
of
:
the
Megsiah
:
Yea
,
did
:
he
not
bear'record
,
thatthe
Son
cee
[File:452]
of
God
should
come
?
And
as
he
lifted
up
the
brazen
serpent
in
the
wilderness
,
even
so
shalt
he
be
lifted
up
who
should
come
,
<And
.
as
many
as
should

look
upon
that
serpent
should
live
,
even
so
as
many
as
should
look
upon
the
Son
of
God
,
with
faith
,
having
a
contrite
spirit
,
might
live
,
even
unto
that
life
which
is
eternal
.
And
now
behold
;
Moses
did
not
only
testify
of
these
things
,
but
also
all
the
holy
.
prophets
,
from
his
days
even
to
the
days
of
Abraham
.
Yea
,
and
be
.
hold
,
Abraham
saw
of
his
coming
,
and
was
filled
with
gladness
,
and
did
rejoice
.
Yea
,
and
behold
I
say
unto
you
,
that
Abraham
not
only
knew
.
ofthese
things
,
but
there
were
many
before
the
days
of
Abraham
who
were
called
by
the
order
of
God
;
yea
,
even
after
the
order
of
his
Son
;
and
this
that
it
should
be
shewn
unto
the
people
a
great
many
thousand
years
before
his
coming
,
that
even
redemption
should
come
unto
them
.
And
nowI
would
-
that
ye
should
know
,
that
even
since
the
days
of
Abraham
,
there
have
been'
many
prophets
that
have
testified
these
things
;
yea
,
hehold
,
the
.
prophet
,
Zenos
did
testify
boldly
;
for
.
the
which
he
was
slain
.
And
behold
,
also
'Zenoch
,
and
also
Ezias
,
and
also
Isaiah
,
and
.
Jeremiah
,
(
Jeremiah
being
that
same
prophet
who
testified
of
the
destruetion
of
Jerusalem
.)
And
now
we
know
that
Jerusalem
was
destroyed
according
to
the
words
of
Jeremiah
,
O
then
why
not
the
Son
of
God
come
,
according
to
his
prophecy
?
And
now
will
-
ye
dispute
that
Jerasalem
was
destroyed
?
Will
ye
say
that
the
sons
of
Zedekiah
were
not'
slain
;
all
except
it
were
Mulekt
Yea
,
and
do
ye
not'behold
that
the
seed
of
Zedekiah
are
with
us
,
and
they
were
driven
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
?
But
behold
,
this
.
is
not
all
,
Our
.
father
Lehi
was
.
driven
out
of
Jerusalem
,
because
he
testified
of
these
things
.
Nephi
also
testified
of
these
.
things
,
and
also
almost
.
all
of
our
.
fathere
,
even
down
to
th
time
;
yea
,
they
have
testified
of
the
coming
of
Christ
,
and
have
looked
forward
,
and
have
rejoiced
in
his
day
which
is
to
come
.
'
And
behold
,
he
is
God
,
and
he
is
with
them
,
and
he
did
manifest
.
himself
unto
:
them
,
that
they
were
redeemed
by
him
;
and
they
gaye
unto
him
.
glory
,
because
of
that
which
ig
to
come
.
And
now
seeing
ye
know
these
things
,
and
cannot
deny
them
,
except
ye
.
shall
lie
,
therefore
.
in
this
.
ye
.
have
sinned
,
for
ye
have
rejected
all
.
these
things
,
notwith

Standing
so
many

,
and
all

,

that
they
are
true
.
But
behold
,
ye
have
rejected
the'ttuth
,
and
rebelled
against
your
holy
God
;
and
even
at
this
time
,
instead
of
laying
up
for
yourselves
treasures
in
heaven
,
where
nothing
doth
corrupt
,
and
where
nothing
can
eome
which
is
unclean
,
ye
are
heaping
up
for
yourselves
wrath
against
the
day
of
judgment
;.
yea
,
even
at
this
time
ye
are
ripening
,
because
of
your
murders
,
and
your
fornication
and
wickedness
,
for
everlasting
destruction
;
yea
,
and
except
ye
repent
,
it
will
come
unto
you
soon
;
yea
,
behold
it
is
now
even
at
your
doors
;
yea
,
go
ye
in
unto
the
judgment
seat
,
and
search
;
and
behold
,
your
judge
is
mardered
,
and
he
lieth
in
his
blood
;
and
he
hath
been
murdered
.
by
his'
brother
,
who
seeketh
to
sit
in
the
judgment
seat
.
And'
behold
,
they
both
belong
to
your
secret
band
,
whose
author
is
Gadianton
,
and
the
evil
one
who
-
seeketh
to
destroy
the
souls
of
men
,
Behold
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Nephi
had
spoken
these
words
,
certain
menwho
were
among
them
ran
to
the
judgment
seat
;
yea
,
even
there
were
five
who
went
;
and
they
said
among
themselves
,
as
they
went
,
behold
,
now
we
will'
know
of
.
asurety
,
whether
this
man
be
a
prophet
,
and
God
hath
commanded
him
to
prophesy
such
marvelous
things
unto
us
.
Behold
we
do
not
believe
that
he
hath
;
yea
,
we
do
not
believe
that
he
is
a
prophet
;
nevertheless
,
if
this
thing
which
he
has
said
concerning
:
the
chief
Judge
-
be
true
;
that
he
be
dead
,
then
will
-
we
believe
thatthe
other
words
which
he
has
spoken
are
trae
.
And
it
came
to
pass'that
they
ran
in
their
might
,
and
came
in
unto
the
judgment
seat
;
and
behold
the
chief
jadge
had
fallen
to
the
edrth
,
and
did
lie
in
his
blood
.
'
Andnow
behold
,
when
they
saw
this
,
they
were
astonished
exceedingly
,
insomuch
that
they
fell
to
the
earth
;
for
they
had
not

When

lest

;
and
behold
,
to
their
astonishment
,
they
saw
those
five
men
who
had
fallen
to

the

,
And
now
behold
,
the
people
knew
nothing
concerning
tae
multitude
who
bad
gathered
together
at
the
garden
of
Nephi
;
therefore
they
said
among
themselves
,
these
men
are

who

murdered
the

and
God
has
smitten

them
that

And
it
came
to

that
,
they
Iaid
hold
on'
them
,
and
bound
them
,
and
east
them
-
into

.
And
.
there
was
a
proclamation
sent

abroad
.
that
.
the
judge
was
slain
,
and
that
the
murderers
had
been
taken
,
and
were
cast
into
prison
.
And
it
came
to
,
pass
that
.
on
the
morrow
,
the
people
did
assemble
themselves
..
together
to
mourn
andto
fast
,
at
ihe
burial
of
the
great
chief
judge
,
who
had
been
slain
..
And
thus
were
also
those
judges
who
.
were
at
the
garden
of
Nephi
,
and
heard
his
words
,
were
also
gathered
together
at
the
burial

o

,
And
it
.
came
to
pass
that
they
inquired
among

the
people
,
saying
,
where

are
the
:
five
who

were
sent
to
,
inquire
concerning
the

whether
he
was

And
they
answered
and
said
,
concerning

ye
say
ye
have

jwe

not
;
but
there
are

who

are
the
murderers
,
whom
we
have
cast
into

prison
.
And
it
came
to
pags
that
the
judges
desired
that
they
should
be
brought
;
and
they
<were
brought
,
and

and

the

the

,
and
they
told
hem
all
.
that
they
had
done
,
saying
,
we
ran
and
came
tothe
place
of
the
judgment
,
and
when
we
saw
all
things
,
even
as
Nephi
had
testified
,
we
were
astonished
,
insomuch
:
that
we
fell
to
the
earth
;
and
,
when

we

were

And
now
it
came
to
pass
,
that
.
the
judges
did

expound
the
matter
unto
the
people
,
and
did
cry
out
against
Nephi
,
saying
,
behold
we
know
that
this
Nenee
must
have
agreed
with
.
some
one
to
slay
the
judge
,
_
and
then
he
might
declare
it
unto
us
,
that
he
might
as
convert
us
.
unto
his
faith
,
that
he
might

make
known
unto
us
the
true
murderer
of
this
judge
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
five
were
liberated
on
the
day
of
the
burial
.,
Nevertheless
,
they
did
rebuke
the
we
es
in
the
words
which
they
had
.
spoken
against
Nephi
,
and
did
contend
with
them
one
by
one
,
insomuch
that
they
did
confound
them
.
Nevertheless
,
they
caused
that
Nephi
should
be
taken
and
bound
and
brought
before
the
multitude
,
and
they
began
to
question
him
in
diverse
ways
,
that
they
might
cross
him
,
that
they
might
accuse
him
to
death
;
saying
unto
him
,
thou
art
confederate
;
who
is
this
man
that
has
done
this
murder
?
Now
tell
us
,
and
.
acknowledge
thy
fault
,
saying
,
behold
heres
money
;
and
also
we
will
grant
unto
thee
thy
life
if
thou
will
tellus
and
acknowledge
the
agreement
which
thou
hast
made
with
him
.
But
.
Nephi
said
unto
them
,
O
ye
fools
,
ye
uncircumcised
,
of
heart
,
ye
blind
,
and
ye
stiffnecked
people
,
do
ye
know
how
long
the
Lord
your
God
will
suffer
you
that
ye
shall
go
on
-
in
this
your
way
of
sin
?
'
O
ye
had
ought
to
begin
to
,
howl
and
mourn
,
because
.
of
the
great
destruction
at
this
time
which
doth
await
you
,
except
ye
shall
repent
.
Behold
,
ye
say
that
I
have
agreed
with
a
man
,
that
he
should
murder
Seezoram
,
our
chief
judge
.
But
behold
,
[
say
unto
you
,
that
this
is
because
I
have
testified
unto
you
,
that
ye
might
know
concerning
this
thing
;
yea
,
even
for
a
witness
unto
you
,
that
I
did
know
of
the
wickedness
and
abominations
which
are
among
you
.
And
because
I
have
done
this
,
ye
say
that
]
have
agreed
with
a
man
that
he
should
do
this
thing
;
yea
,
because
I
shewed
unto
you
this
sign
,
ye
are
.
angry
with
me
,
and
seek
to
destroy
my
life
.
And
now
behold
,
I
will
shew
unto
you
another
sign
,
and
see
if
ye
will
in
this
thing
seek
to
destroy
me
.
Behold
I
say
u
:.
to
you
,
go
to
the
house
of
Seantum
,
who
is
the
brother
of
Seezoram
,
and
say
unto
him
,
has
Nephi
,
the
pretended
prophet
,
who
doth
prophesy
so
much
evil
concerning
tais
people
,
agreed

with
thee
,
in
the
which
ye
have
murdered
Seezoram
,
who
is
your
brother
?
And
behold
,
he
shall
say
unto
you
,
,
nay
.
And
ye
shall
say
unto
him
,
have
ye
.
murdered
your
brother
?
And
he
shall
stand
with
fear
,
and
wist
not
what
to
say
.
And
behold
,
he
shall
deny
unto
you
;.
and
he
shall
make
as
if
-
he
were
astonished
;
ney
ertheless
,
he
shall
declare
unto
you
that
he
is
inno
cent
,
But
behold
,
ye
shall
examine
him
,
and
ye
shall
[File:456]
find
blood
upon
the
skirts
of
his
-
cloak
...
And
when
ye
have
seen
this
,
ye
shall
say
,
from
whence
cometh
this
blood
?
Do
we
not'
know
that
it
is
the
blood
of
your
brother
?
And
then
:
shall
hetremble
,
and
shall
jook
pale
,
even
as
if
death'had
come
upon
him
.
And
then
shall
ye
say
,
because
of
this
fear
and
this
paleness
Which
has
come
upon
your
face
,
behold
,
we
know
that
thou
art
guilty
.
And
then
shall
greater
fear
come
upon
him
;
and
then
shall
he
confess
unto
you
,
and
deny
no
more
that
he
has
done
this'murder
,
And
then
shall
he
say
unto
you
,
that
.
J
,
Nephi
,
know
nothing
concerning
the
matter
,
save
it
were
given
unto'me
by
the
power
of
God
.
And
then
shall
ye
know
that
T
am
an
honest
man
,
and
that
I
am
sent
unto
you
from
God
.
And
it
came
to'
pass
that
they
went
and

did
,
even
according
as
Nephi
,
had
said
unto
them
.
And
behold
,
the
words
which
he
had
said
,
were
true
;
for
according
to
the
words
,
he
did
deny
;
and
also
according
to
the
words
he
did
confess
.
And
he
was
brought
to
prove
that
he
himself
was
the
very
murderer
,
insomuch
that
the
five
were
set
at
liberty
;
and
also
was
Nephi
,
And
there
were
some
of
the
Nephites
who
believed
on
the
words
of
Nephi
;
and
there
were
some
also
,
who
believed
,
because
of
the
testimony
of
the
five
,
for
they
had
been
converted
while
they
were
in
prison
.
And
now
there
were
some
among
the
people
,
who
said
that
Nephi
was
a
prophet
;
and
there
were
others
who
said
,
behold
,
he
is
a
god
,
for
except
he
was
a
god
,
he
could
not
know
of
ali
-
things
.
For
behold
,
he
has
told'us
the
thoughts
of
our
hearts
,
and
also
has
told
us
things
;
and
ever
he
has
brought
unto
our
knowledge
the
true
murderer
of
our
chief
judge
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
arose
a
division
among
the
people
,
insomuch
that
-
they
.
divided
hither
and
thither
,
and
went
their
ways
,
leaving
Nephi
alone
,
as
he
was
-
standing
in'the
midst
of
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
went
his
way
towards
his
own
house
,
pondering
upon
the
.
things
which
the
Lord
had
shewn
unto
him
.
And_
it
came
to
pass
a3
he
was
thus
pondering

being
much
cast
down
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
of
the
Nephites
,
their
secret
works
of
darkness
,
and
their
murderings
,
and
.
their
plunderings
,
and
all
manner
of
iniquities
.
and'it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
thus
pondering
in
.
his
heart
,
behold
;
'a
voice
came
unto
him
,
saying
,

sought

with

with

and

according
to
the
wickedness
of

And
behold
,
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
Lord
had
spoken
these
words
unto
Nephi
,
he
did
stop
,
and
did
not
go
unto
his
own
house
,
but
did
return
unto
the
.
multitudes
who
were
scattered
about
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
began
to
declare
unto
them
the
word
of
the
Lord
,
which
had
been
spoken
unto
.
him
soncerning
their
destruction
,
if
they
did
not
repent
.
Now
behold
,
notwithstanding
that
great
miracle
which
Nephi
had
done
in
telling
them
concerning
the
death
of
the
chief
judge
,
they
did
harden
their
hearts
,
and
did
not
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
Lord
;
therefore
Nephi
did
declare
unto
them
the
word
of
the
Lord
,
saying
,
extept
ye
repent

thus
saith
the

ye

it

came
to

that
.
when
Nepht
had

declared
unto
them
the
word

behold
,
they
did
still
harden
their
hearts
,
and
would
not
hearken
,
unto
,
his

words
;
therefore
they
did
revile
against
him

did
seek
to
lay
their

hands
[File:458]
upon
him
,
that
they
might
cast
him
into
prison
.
But
behold
,
the
power
of
God
was
with
him
,
and
they
could
not
take
him
to
cast
him
intoprison

for
he
was
taken
by
the
spirit
,
and
conveyed
away
out

And
it
came
topass
that
thus
he
did'
go
forth
in
the
spirit
,
from
multitude
to
multitude
,
declaring
the
word
of
God
,
even
until
he
had
declared
it
unto
them
all
,
or
sent
it
forth
among
all
the
people

â
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
would
not
hearken
unto
his
words
;
and
there
began
to
be
contentions
,
insomuch
that
they
were
divided
against
themselves
,
and
began
to
slay
one
another
with
the
sword
.
And
thus
ended
the
seventy
and

year
of
the
reign
of
the

Anp
now
it
came
to
.
pass
in
the
seventy
and
second
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
that
the
contentions
did
increase
,
insomuch
that
there
were
wars
throughout
all
the
land
among
all
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
it
was
this
secret
band
of
robbers
who
did
carry
on
this
work
of
destruction
and
wickedness
.
And
this
war
did
last
all
that
year
.
And
in
the
seventy
and
third
year
it
did
also
last
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
inthis
year
,
Nephi
did
ery
unto
the
Lord
,
saying
,
O
Lord
do
not
suffer
that
this
people
shall
be
destroyed
by
the
sword
;
but
O
Lord
,
rather
let
there
be
a
famine
in
the
land
,
to
stir
them
up
in'remembrance
of
the
Lord
their
God
,
and
perhaps
they
will
repent
and
turn
unto'
thee
;
and
so
it
was
done
,
according
to
the
words
of
Nephi
.
'
And
there
was
a
great
famine
upon
the
land
,
among
all
the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
thus
,
in
theseventy
and
fourth
year
,
the
famine
did
continue
,
and
the
work
of
des
truction'did
cease
bythe
sword
,
but
became
sore
by
famine
.
And
this
work
-
of
destruction
did
also
continue
in
the
seventy
and
fifth
year
,
For
the
earth'
was
smitten

And
it
caine
to
pass
that
the
people
saw
that
they
were
about
to
perish
by
famine
,
and
they
began
to
remember
the
Lord
their
God
;
and
they
began
to

member
the
words
of
Nephi
.
And
the
people
began
to
plead
with
their
chief
judges
and
their
leaders
,
that
they
.
would
say
unto
Nephi
,
behold
,
we
know
that
thou
art
a
man
of
God
,
and
therefore
cry
unto
the
Lord
our
God
,
that
he
turn
ayvay
from
us
this
famine
,
lest
all
the
words
which
thou
hast
spoken
concerning
our
desiruction
,
be
fulfilled
.-
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
judges
did
say
unto
Nephi
,
according
to
the
words
which
had
been
desired
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Nephi'saw
that
the
people
had
repented
,
and
did
humble
themselves
in
sackcloth
,
he
cried
egain
unto
the
Lord
,
saying
,
O
Lord
,
behold
this
people
repenteth
;
and
they
have
swept
away
the
band
of
Gadianton
from
amongst
them
,
insomuch
that
they
have
become
extinct
,
and
they
have
concealed
their
sectet
plans
in
the
earth
.
Now
,
O

Lord
,
because
of
this
their
.
humility
,
wilt
thou
turn
away

thine
anger
,
andlet
thine
anger
be
appeased
in
the
destruction
of
those
wicked
men
whom
thou
hast
already
destroyed
?
O
Lord
,
wilt
thou
turn
away
thine
anger
,
yea
,
thy
fierce
anger
,
and
cause
that
this
famine
may
cease
in
this
land
?,
O
Lord
,
wilt
thou
hearken
unto
me
,
and
cause
that
it
may
be
done
according

to
my
words
,
and
send
forth
rain
upon
the
face
of
the
earth

that
she
may

in

,
the
people
did
rejoice
,,
and
glorify
God
,
and
the
whole
face
of
the
land
was
filled
with
rejoicing
;
and
they
did
ho
more
seek
to
destroy
Nephi
,
but
they
did
esteem
himas
a
great
prophet
,
and
a
manof
God
,
having
great
power
and
authority
given
unto
him
from
God
.
nd
behold
,
Lehi
,
his
brothers
was
not
a
whit
behind
him
as
to
things
pertaining
to
righteousness
.
And
thus
it
did
come
to
pass
that
the
people
of
Nephi
began
to
prosper
-
again
in
the
land
,
and
began
to
build
up
their
waste
places
,
and
began
to
multiply
and
spread
,
even
until
they
did
cover
the
whole
face
of
the
land
,
both
on
the
northward
and
on
the
southward
,
from
the
sea
west
,
to
the
sea
east
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
seventy
and
sixth
year
did
end
in
peace
.
And
the
seventy
and
seventh
year
began
in
peace
;
and
the
church
did
spread
thoughout
the
face
of
all
the
land
:
and
the
more
part
of
the
people
,
both
the
Nephites
and
the
Lamanites
,
did
belong
to
the
church
;
and
they
.
did
have
exceeding
great
peace
in
the
land
,
and
thus
ended
the
seventy
and
seventh
year
.
And
also
they
had
peace
in
the
seventy
and
eighty
year
,
save
it
were
a
few
contentions
concerning
the
points
of
doctrine
which
had
been
laid
down
by
the
prophets
.
And
in
the
seventy
and
ninth
year
,
there
began
to
be
much
strife
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
and
Lehi
,
and
many
of
their
brethren
,
who
knew
concerning
the
true
points
of
doctrine
,
having
many
revelations
daily
,
therefore
they
did
preach
unto
the
people
,
insomuch
that
they
did
put
an
end
to
their
strife
in
that
same
year
.

,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
theeightieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
,
there
were
a
certain
number
of
the
dissenters
from
the
people
of
Nephi
,
who
had
some
years
before
gone
over
unto
the
Lamanites
,
and
took
upon
themselves
the
name
of
Lamanites
;
and
also
,
a
certain
number
who
were
real
descendants
of
the
Lamanites
,
being
.
stirred
up
to
.
anger
.
by
them
,
or
by
-
those
dissenters
,
therefore
they
commenced
a'war
with
their
brethren
.
And
they
did
.
commit
marder
and
:
plunder
;
and
then
they
would
retreat
back
into
the
mountains
,
and
into
the
wilderness
and
secret
places
,
hiding
.
themselves
that
they
,
could
not
be
-
discovered
,
receiving
daily
an
addition
to
their
numbers
,
inasmuch
as
there
were
dissent
ers

and
thus

in
time

inthe
space

of

not
:
many

years
,
they

became
a0
exceeding
great

of
robbers
;,
and
they
:
did

seatel

[File:461]
out
all
the
secret
plans
of
Gadianton
;
and
thus
they
became
robbers
of
Gadianton
.
Now
behold
,
these
robbers
did
make
great
.
havoc
,.
yea
;
even
great
destructraction
among
the
people
of
Nephi
,
and
also
among
the
people
of
the
Lamanites
.
.
And
,
it
ame
to
pass
that
it
was
expedient
that
there
should
.
be
.
a
stop
put
to
this
work
of
destruction
;
therefore
they
sent
an
-
army
of
strong
men
into
the
wilderness
,
and
upon
the
mountains
to
search
out
this
band
of
robbers
,
and
to
destroy
them
.
But
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
that
in
that
same
year
,
they
were
driven
back
even
into
their
own
lands
..
And
thus
ended
the
eightieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
over
the
people
of
Nephi
.
:
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
the
eighty
and
first
year
,
they
did
go
forth
again
against
this
band
of
robers
,
and
did
destroy
many
;
and
they
were
also
visited
with
much
destruction
;
dnd
they
were
again
obliged
to
return
out
of
the
wilderness
,
and
out
of
the
mountains
,
unto
their
own
lands
,
because
of
the
exceeding
greatness
of
the
numbers
of
those
robbers
who
infested
the
mountains
and
the
wilderness
:
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
ended
this
year
.
And
the
robbers
did
still
increase
and
wax
.
strong
,
insomuch
that
they
did
defy
the
whole
armies
of
the
Nephites
,
and
also
of
the
Lamanites
;
and
the
did
cause
great
fear
to
come
unto
the
people
,
upon
the
face
of
the
land
;
yea
,
for
they
did
visit
many
parts
of
the
land
,
and
did
do
great
destruction
unto
them
;
yea
,
did
kill
many
,
and
did
carry
away
others
captive
into
the
wilderness
;
yea
,
and
more
especially
their
womenand
their
children
.
Now
this
great
evil
,
which
came
-
unto
the
people
because
of
their
iniquity
did
,
stir
them
up
again
in
remembrance
of
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
thus
ended
the
eighty
and
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
.
And
in
the
eighty
and
see
:
ond
year
,
they
began
again
to
forget
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
-
in
the
eighty
and
third
year
,
they
began
to
wax
strong
in
iniquity
.
And
in
the
eighty
and
fourth
year
,
they
did
not
mend
their
ways
.
And
it
came
to
pass
-
in
the
eighty
and
fifth
year
,
they
did
Wax
stronger
and
stronger
in
their
pride
,
and
in
their
Wickedness
;
and
thus
they
were
ripening
again
for
destruction
.
And
thus
ended
the
eighty
and
-
fifth
year
,
And
thus
we
can
behold
how
false
,
and
also
the
unsteadiness
of
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
.
men
;
yea
,
we
can
see
that
the
Lord
in
his
:
great
infinite
[File:462]
goodness
,
doth
bless
and
prosper
those
who
put
their
trust
in
him
;
yea
,
and
we
may
see
at
the
very
time
when
he
doth
prosper
his
people
;
yea
,
in
the
increaga
of
their
fields
,
,
their
flocks
,
and
their
herds
,
and
in
gold
,
and
in
silver
,
and
in
all
manner
of
precious
things
of
every
kind
,
and
art
;
sparing
their
lives
,
and
deliv
.
ering
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
;
soften
.
ing
the
hearts
of
their
.
enemies
,
that
they
should
not
declare
wars
against
them
;
-
yea
,
and
in
fine
,
doing
alt
things
for
the
welfare'
and
happiness
of
his
people
;
yea
,
then
is
the
time
that
they
do
harden
their
hearts
,
and
do
forget
the
Lord
their
God
,
and
do
trample
under
their
feet
the
Holy
One
;
yea
,
and
this
because
of
their
ease
,
and
their
exceeding
great
prosperity
.
And
thus
we
see
,
that
except
the
Lord
doth
ehasten
his
people
with
many
afflictions
,
yea
,
except
he
doth
visit
them
with
death
,
and
with
terror
,
and
with
famine
,
and
with
all
manner
of
-
pestilences
,
they
will
not
remember
.
him
.
O
how
foolish
,
and
how
vain
,
and
how
evil
,
and
devilish
,
and
how
quick
to
do
iniquity
,
and
how
slow
to
do
good
,
are
the
children
of
mien
;
yea
,
hew
quick
to
hearken
unto
the
words
of
the
evil
one
,
and
to'
set
their
hearts
upon
the
vain
things
of
the
world
;
yea
,
how
quick
to
be
lifted
up
in
pride
;
yea
,
how
quick
to
boast
,
and
do
all
manner
of
that
which
is
iniquity
;.
and
how
slow
are
they
to
remember
the
Lord
their
God
,
and
to
give
ear
unto
his
counsels
;
yea
,
how
slow
to
walk
in
wisdom's
paths
!
-
Behold
,
they
do
not
desire
that
the
Lord
their
God
,
who
hath
created
them
,
should
rule
and
reign
over
ther
,
notwithstanding
his
great
goodness
and
his
mercy
towards
them
;
they
do
set
-
at
nought
his
counsels
,
and
they
will
not
that
he
should
be
their
guide
.
O
how
great
is
the
nothingness
of
the
e
):
ildren
of
men
;
yea
,
even
they
are
less
than
the
dust
of
the
earth
.
For
behold
,
the
dust
of
the
earth
moyeth
hither
and
thither
,
to
the
dividing
asunder
,
at
the
command
of
our
great
and
everlasting
God
;
yea
,
behold
,
at
,
his
voice
-
doth
the
hills
and
theymountains
trembleand
quake
;
and
by
the
power
of
his
voice
they
are
broken
up
,
and
become
smooth
,
yea
,
even
like
unto
,
avalley
;
yea
,
by
the
power
of
his
voice
doth
the
whole
earth
shake
;
yea
,
by
the
power
of
his
voice
,
doth
the

foundations
rock
,
even
to
the
very
center
;
yea
,
and
if
he
say
unto

itis
moved
;
yea
,
if
he

thoo

that
it

for

,
it
is
done
;
and
thus
:
according
to
:
his
wor
ie
[File:463]
the
earth
goeth
back
,
and
it
appeareth
unto
man
that
the
sun
standeth
still
;
yea
,
and
behold
,
this
is
su
;
for
sure
it
is
the
earth
that
meyeth
,
and
not
the
sun
.
And
behold
,
also
,
if
he
say
unto

of
the
great

be
thou
dried
up

it

Behold

if

and
come

and
fall
upon

that

behold
it

And
behold
,
if
aman

and

the
Lord
shall
say
,
let
it
be
accursed

because
of
the
iniquity
of
him
who
hath
hid

behold
,
it
shall
be
accursed

and
if
the

shall

,
be
thou
accursed

that
no
man
shall
find
thee
from
this
time
henceforth
and

forever

behold
,
no

forever
,
And
behold
if
the
Lord
shall

unto
a
man
,
because
of
thine
iniquities
thou
shalt
be
acursed
forever
,
it
shall

And
ifthe
Lord
shall
say
,
because

thine
iniquities
,
thou
shalt
be
cut
off

from
my
presence
,
he
will
cause
that
it
shall'
be
so
.
And
wounto
him
to
whom
he
shall
say
this
,
for
it
shall
be
unto
him
that
will
do
iniquity
,
and
he
cannot
be
saved
;
therefore
,
for
this
.
cause
,
that
men
might
be'saved
,
hath
repentance
been
declared
.
Therefore
,
blessed
are
they
who
will

repent
and
hearken
unto
the
voice
of
the
Lord
their
God
;
for
these
are
they
\hat
shall

.
And
may
God
grant
,,
in
his
great
fulness
,
that
men
might
be
brought
unto
repentance
and
good
works
,
that
they
might
be
restored
unto
grace
,
for
grace
according
totheir
works
.
And
I
would
that
all
men
might
be
saved
.
But
we
read
that
in
that
great
and
last
day
,
there
-
are
some
who
shall
be
cast
out
;
yea
,
who
shall
be
cast
off
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
who
shall
be
consigned
toa
state
ot
endless
misery
,
fulfilling
the
words
which
say
,
they
that
have
done
good
,
shall
have
everlasting
life
;
andthey
that
have
done
evil
,
shall
have
everlasting
damnation

And
thus
it

Amen

V

THE
PROPHECY
OF
SAMUEL
,
THE
LAMANITE
,
TO
THE
NEPHITES
.
;
AND
now
it
came
{o
passin
the
eighty
and
sixth
year
,
the
Nephites
did
still
remain
in
wickedness
,
yea
,
Im
great
wickedness
,
while
the
Lamanites
did
observe
strictly
to
keep
the
commandments
of
God
,
according
to
the
law
of
Moses
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
year
,
there
was
one
Samuel
,
a
Lamanite
,
came
into
the
land
of
Garahemla
,
and
bee
to
,
preach
unto
the
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
-
that
he
did
preach
many
days
,
repentance
unto
the
people
,
and
they
did
cast
him
.
out
,
and
he
was
about
to
return
to
-
his
own
land
,
But
behold
,
the
voice
of
the
Lord
came
unto
him
,
that
he
should
return
again
,
and
proyhesy
.
unto
the
people
whatsoever
things
should
come
into
his
heart
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
would
not
suffer
that
he
should
enter
into
the
city
;
therefore
he
went
and
got
upon
the
.
wall
thereof
,
and
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
cried
with
a
loud
voice
,
and
prophesied
unto
the
people
,
whatsoever
things
the
Lord
put
into
his
heart
;
and
he
-
said
unto
them
,
behold
,
I
,
Samuel
,
a
Lamanite
,
do
speak
the
words
of
the
Lord
which
he
doth
put
into
my
heart
;
and
:
behold
he
hath
put
it
into
my
heart
to
sayunto
this
people
,
that
the
sword
of
justice
hangeth
over
this
people
;
and
four
hundred
years
passeth
not
away
save
the
sword
of
justice
falleth
upen
this
people
;
yea
,
heavy
destruction
awaiteth
this
people
,
and
it
surely
cometh
unto
this
people
,
and
nothing
can
save
this
people
,
save
it
be
repentance
_
and
faith
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
,
who
surely
shall
come
into
the
world
,
aid
shall
suffer
many
things
,
and
shall
be
slain
for
his
people
.
And
behold
,
an
angel
of
the
Lord
hath
declared
it
unto
me
,
and
he
did
bring
glad
tidings
to
my
soul
.
And
behold
,
[
was
sent
unto
.
you
to
declare
it
unto
you
also
,
that
ye
might
have
glad
tidings
;
but
behold
ye
would
not
receive
me
,
therefore
thug
saith
.
the
Lord
,
because
of
the
hardness
ofthe
hearts
of
the
people
of
the
Nephites
,
except
they
repent
I
will
take
away
my
word
,
from
them
,
and
I
will
withdraw
my
spirit
from
them
,
and
I
will
suffer
them
no
longer
,
and
I
will
turn
the
hearts
of
their
brethren
against
them
;
and
four
hundred
.
years
shall
not
pass
away
,
before
I
will
cauge
that
they
shall
be
[File:465]
smitten
;
yea
,
I
will
visit
them
with
the
sword
,
and
with
famine
,
and
with
pestilence
;
yea
,
I
will
visit
them
in
my
fieree'gnger
,
and
there
shall
be
those
of
the
fourth
generation
,
who
shall
live
,
of
your
enemies
,
to
behold
your
utter
destruction
;
and
this
shall
surely
come
,
except
ye
repent
,
saith
the
Lord
:
and
those
of
the
fourth
generation
shall
visit
your
destruction
..
But
if
ye
will
repent
and
return
unto
the
Lord
your
God
,
I
will
turn
away
mine
anger
saith
the
Lord
;
yea
,
thus
saith
the
Lord
,
blessed
are
they
who
will
repent
and
turn
unto
me
,
but
wo
unto
him
that
repenteth
not
;
yea
,
wo
unto
this
great
city
of
Zarahemla
;
for
behold
it
is
because
of
those
who
are
righteous
,
that
it
is
saved
;
yea
,
wo
unto
this
great
city

for
I
perceive
,
saith

the
niore
part

this
great
city

But
blessed
are
they

who
will
repent

forthem
willl
spare
.
But
behold
if
it
were
not
for
the
righteous
who
are
in
this
great
city
,
behold
I
would
cause
that
fire
should
come
down
out
of
heaven
,
and
destroy
it
.
But
behold
,
it
is
for
the
righteous'
sake
,
that
it
is
spared
.
But
behold
,
the
lime
cometh
,
saith
the
Lord
,
that
when
ye
shall
cast
out
the
righteous
from
among
you
,
then
shall
ye
be
ripe
for
destruction
;
yea

be
unto
all
the
cities
which

and
in
that

saith
the
Lord
.
Behold
ye
,
the
peo

ple
of
this
great
city
,
and
hearken
unto
my
words
;
yer
hearken
unto
the
words
which'the
Lord
saith
;
for
ehold
,
he
saith
that
ye
are
cursed
because
of
your
riches
,
and
also
are
your
riches
cursed
because
ye
have
set
your
hearts
upon
them
,
and
have
not
hearkened
unto
the
words
of
him
who
gave
them
unito
-
you
.
Ye
do
not
remember
the
Lord
your
God
in
the
things
which
he
hath
blessed
you
,
but
ye
do
always
remenber
your
riches
,
not
to
thank
the
Lord
your
God
for
them
;
yea
,
your
heart
-
is
not
drawn
out
unto
the
Lord
,
but
they
do
swell
with
great
pride
,
unto
boasting
,
and
unto
great
swelling
,
envyings
,
strifes
,
malice
,
perseentions
,
and
murders
,
and
all
manner
of
iniquities
.
For'
this
cause
hath
the
Lord
God
caused
that
a
curse
should
comeupon
tlie
land
,
and
also
upon
your
riches
;
and
this
because
of
your
iniquities
;
yea
,
wo
unto
this
people
,
because
of
this
time
which
has
arriven
,
thet
ye
do
cast
out
the
prophets
,
and
do
mock
them
,
and
ast
stones
at
them
,
and
do
slay
them
,
and
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
unto
them
,
even
as
they
did
of
old
time
.
And
now
when
ye
talk
,
ye
say
,
if
our
days
had
been
in
the
days
of
our
fathers
of
old
,
ye
would
not
have
slain
the
prophets
;
ye
would
not
have
stoned
them
,
and
cast
them
out
.
Behold
ye
are
worse
than
_

O
ye
wicked
and
ye
perverse
generation
;
ye
hardened
and
ye
stiffnecked
people
,
how
long
will
esuppose
that
the
Lord
will
suffer
you
:
yea
,
how

will
ye
suffer
yourselves
to

;
yea

how

will
ye
choose
darkness
rather
than

;
yea
,
behold
the
anger
of
the
Lord
is
:
already
kindled
against
you
;
behold
,
he
hath
cursed
the
land
,
because
of
your
iniquity
;
and
behold
,
the
time
cometh
that
he
curseth
your
riches
,
that
it
becometh
slippery
,
that
ye
cannot
hold
them
;
and
inthe
days
of
your
poverty
ye
cannot
retain
them
;
and
in
the
days
of
your
.
poverty
,
ye
shall
cry
unto
the
Lord
;
and
in
vain
shall
ye
cry
,
for
your
desolation
is
already
come
upon
you
,
and
your
destruction
is
made
sure
;
and
then
shall
ye
weep
and
howl
in
that
day
,
saith
the
Lord
of
Hosts
.
And
then
shall
ye
lament
,
and
say
;
O
that
I
had
repented
,
and
had
not'killed
the
prophets
,
and
stoned
them
,
and
cast
them
out
;
yea
,
in
that
day
ye
shall
say
,
O
that
we
had
remembered
the
Lord
our
God
,
in
the
day
that
he
gave
us
our
tiches
,
and
then
they
would
not
have
become
:
slippery
,
that
we
should
lose
them
;
for
behold
,
our
riches
are
gone
from
us
.
Behold
,
we
lay
a
tool
here
,
and
on
the
morrowit
ig
gone
;
arid
behold
,.
our
swords
are
taken
from
us
in
the
day
we
have
sought
them
for
battle
..
Yea
,
we
have
hid
up
our
treasures
,
and
they
have
slipped
away
from
us
,
because
of
the
curse
of
the
land
..
O'that
we
had
repented
in
the
day
that
the
word
of
the
Lord
came
unto
us
;
for
behold
the
land
is
eursed
,
andall
things
are
become
slippery
,
and
we
camnot
hold
them
.
Behold
we
are
surrounded
by
demons
;
yea
,
we
are
encircled
about
by
the
angels
of
him
who
hath
sought'
to
destroy
our
souls
.
Behold
,
our
iniquities
.
_
are
great
.
Q
Lord
,
canst
thou
not
turn
away
thine
anger
from
us
?
And
this
shall
be
your
language
in
those
-
days
,
But
behold
,
your
days
of
probation
are
pest
;
ye
have
procrastinated
the
day
of
your
salvation
,
until
it
is
everlastingly
too
late
,
and
your
destruction
ls
made'sure
;
yea
,
for
ye
have'
sought
all
the
days
of
re
lives
for
that
which
ye'could
not
obtain
;
and
ye
ve
sought
for
happiness
in
doing
iniquity
,
which

O
ye
people
the
land
,
that
ye
would
hear
my
words
.
And
I
pray
[File:468]
that
the
anger
of
the
Lord
be
turned
away
from
you
,
and
that
ye
would
repent
and
be
saved
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
Samuel
,
the
Lamanite
,
did
prophesy
a
gteat
many
more
things
which
cannot
be
written
.
And
behold
,
he
said
unto
them
,
behold
,
I
give
unto
you
a
sign
:
for
five
years
more
cometh
,
and
behold
,
then
cometh
the
Son
of
God
to
redeem
all
those
who
shall
believe
on
his
name
.
And
behold
,
this
will
I
give
unto
you
for
a
sign
at
the
time'of
his
coming
;
for
behold
,
there
shall
be
great
lights
in
heayen
,
insomuch
that
in
the
night
betore
he
cometh
,
there
shall
be
no
darkness
,
insomuch
that
it
shall
appear
untoman
as
if
it
was
day
;
therefore
there
shall
be
one
day
anda
night
,
and
a
day
,
as
if
it
were
one
day
,
and
there
were
no
night
;
and
this
shall
be
unto
you
fora
sign
;
for
ye
shall
know
of
the
rising
of
the
sun
,
and
also
of
its
setting
;
therefore
they
shall
know
ofa
surety
that
there
shall
be
two
days
and
a
night
;
nevertheless
the
night
shall
.
not
be
darkened
;
and
it
shall
be
the
night
before
he
is
born
.
And
behold
there
shalla
new
star
arise
,
such
an
one
as
ye
never
have
beheld
;
and
this
also
shall
be
a
sign
unto
you
.
And
behold
this
is
not
all
,
there
shall
be
many
signs
.
and
wonders
in
heaven
.
And
it
shall
cometo
pass
that
ye
shall
ail
be
amazed
,
and
wonder
,
insomuch
thatrye
shall
fall
to
the
earth
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
whosoever
shall
believe
on
the
Son
of
God
,
the
same
shall
have
everlasting
life
.
And
behold
,
thus
hath
the
Lord
commanded
me
,
by
his
angel
,
that
I
should
come
atd
tell
this
thing
unto
you
;
yea
,
he
hath
commanded
that
I
should
prophesy
these
things
unto
you
;
yea
,
he
hath
said
unto
me
,
cry
unto
this
people
,
repent
and
prepare
the
way
of
the
Lord
.
And
now
because
I
am
a
Lamanite
,
and
have
spoken
unto
you
the
words
which
the
Lord
hath
commanded
me
,
and
because
!
t
wae
hard
against
you
,
ye
are
angry
with
me
,
and
d0
seek
:
to
destroy
me
,
and
have
cast
me
out
from
among
ou
.
And
ye
shall
hear
my
words
,
for
,
for
this
intent
have
come
up
upon
the
walls
of
this
city
,
thaty
?
might
hear
andknow
of
.
the
judgments
of
od
which
do
await
you
because
of
your
iniquities
,
and
also
that
ye
-
might
know
the
conditions
of
repentance
;
and
als
?
that
ye
might
know
of
the
coming
.
of
Jesus
Christ
,
the
Son
.
of
God
,
the
Father
of
heaven
.
and
of
earth
,
the
.
Creator
.
of
all
things
,
from
the
,
beginning
:
and
that
ye
might
know
of
the
signs
of
his
coming
,
to
the
intent
that
ye
might
believe
,
on
,
his
name
,
And
.
if'y
[File:469]
believe
on
his
name
,
ye
will
repent
of
all
.
your
sins
,
that
thereby
ye
may
have
a
,
remission
of
them
through
his
merits
.
And
behold
,
again
another
sign
I
give
unto
you
;
yea
,
a
sign
of
his
death
;
for
behold
,
he
surely
must
die
,
that
salvation
may
come
;
yea
,
it
behooveth
him
,
and
becometh
expedient
that
he
dieth
,
to
bring
to
pass
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
,
that
thereby
men
may
be
brought
into
the
presence
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
behold
this
death
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
,
and
redeemeth
all
mankind
from
the
first
death
;
that
spiritual
death
for
all
mankind
,
by
the
fall
of
Adam
,
being
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
,
or
considered
as
dead
,
both
as
to
things
temporal
and
to
things
spiritual
.
But
behold}
the
resurrection
of
Christ
redeemeth
mankind
,
yea
,
ever
all
mankind
,
and
bringeth
them
back
into
the
presence
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
and
it
bringeth
to'pass
the
condition
of
repentance
,
that
whosoeyer
repenteth
,
the
same
is
not
-
hewn
dewn
and
cast
into
the
fire
;
but
whosoever
repenteth
not
,
is
hewn
down
aud
-
cast
into
the
fire
,
and
there
cometh
upon
them
again
a
spiritual
death
,
yea
,
a
second
death
,
for
they
are
-
cut
off
again
as
to
things
pertaining
to
righteousness
;
therefore
repent
ye
;
repent
ye
,
lest
by
knowing
these
things
and
not
doing
them
,
ye
shall
suffer
yourselves
to
come
under
condemnation
,
and
ye
are
brought
down
unto
this
second
death
.
But
.
behold
,
as
I
said
unto
you
concerning
another
sign
,
a
sign
of
his
death
,
behold
,
in
that
day
that
he
shall
suffer
death
,
the
sun
shall
be
darkened
and
refuse
to
give
his
light
unto
you
;
and
also
the
moon
,
and
the
stars
;
and
there
shall
be
no
light
upon
the
face
of
this
land
,
even
from
the
time
that
he
shall
suffer
death
,
for
the
space
of
three
days
,
tothe
time
that
he
shall
rise
again
from
the
dead
;
yea
,
at
the
time
that
he
shall
yield
up
the
ghost
,
.
there
shall
be
thunderings
and
hghtnings
for
the
space
of
many
hours
;
and
the
earth
shall
shake
and
tremble
,
and
the
rocks
which
are
upon
the
face
of
this
.
earth
,
Which
are
both
above
the
earth
and
beneath
,
which
ye
know
at
this
time
are
solid
,
or
the
more
part
of
it
is
one
solid
mass
,.
shall
be
broken
up
;
yea
,
they
shall
be
rent
in
twain
,
and
sball
ever
after
be
found
in
.
seams
and
in
cracks
,
and
in
broken
fragments
upon
the
face
ofthe
whole
earth
;
yea
,
both
above
the
earth
and
be
neath
,
And
behald
there
shall
be
great
tempests
,
and
there'shall
be
:
many
mountains
laid
.
low
,
like
.
unto
a
valley
,-
and
thereshall
be
many
places
,
which
are
now
salled
valleys
,
which
shall
become
mountains
,
whose
[File:470]
height
thereof
is
great
.
And
many
highways
shall
be
broken
up
,
and
many
cities
shall
become
desolate
,
and
many
graves
shall
be
opened
,.
and
shall
yield
up
many
of
.
their
dead
;
and
many
saints
.
shall
appear
.
unto
ma
ny
.
And
behold
thus
hath
the
angel
spoken
unto
me
;
for
he
said
unto
me
,
that
there
should
be
thunderings
and
lightnings
for
the
space
of
many
hours
;
and
he
said
urito
me
that
while
the
thunder
and
the
lightning
lasted
,
and
the
tempest
,
that
these
things
should
be
,
and
that
darkness
should
cover
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
,
for
the
space
of
three
days
.
And
the
angel
said
unto
me
that
many
shall
see
greater
things
than
these
,
to
the
intent
that
they
might
believe
that
these
signs
and
these
wonders
should
come
to
pass
,
upon
all
the
face
of
this
land
;
to
the
intent
that
there
should
be
no
eause
for
unbelief
among
the
children
of
men
;
and
this
to
the
intent
that
whosoever
will
believe
,
might
be
saved
,
and
that
whosoever
will
not
believe
,
a
righteous
judgment
might
come
upon
them
;
and
also
if
they
are
condemned
,
.
they
bring
upon
themselves
their
own
condemnation
.
And
now
remember
,
remember
,
my
brethren
,
that
whosoever
perisheth
,
perisheth
unto
himselt
;
and
whosoever
doeth
iniquity
,
doeth
it
unto
himself
;
for
behold
ye
are
free
;
ye
are
permitted
to
.
act
.
for
yourselves
;
for
behold
,
God
hath
given
unto
you
a
knowledge
,
and
he
hath
made
you
free
;
he
hath
given
unto
you
that
ye
might
know
good
from
evil
,
and
he
hath
given
unto
you
that
ye
might
choose
lift
or
death
,
and
ye
can
.
do
goodand
be
restored
unto
that
which'
is
good
,
or
have
that
which
is
good
restored
unto
you
;
or
.
ye
can
do
evil
,
and
have
that
which
is
evil
.
restored
unto
you
.
And
now
my
beleved
brethren
,
.
behold
,
I
declare
unto
you
that
except
ye
shall
repent
,
your
houses
shall
be
left
unto
you
desolate
;
yea
,
xcept
ye
repent
,
your
women
shall
have
great
cause
to
mourn
in
the
day
that
they
shall
give
suck
;
for
ye
shall
attempt
to
flee
,
and
.
there
shall
be
no
place
for
refuge
;
yea
,
and
wo
unto
them
which
are
with
child
,
for
they
shall
be
heavy
,
and
cannot
flee
;
therefore
they
shall
be
trodden
down
,
and
shall
be
left
to
perish
;
ea
,
wo
unto
this
people
who
are
called
the
people
of
ephi
,
except
they
shall
repent
when
they
shall
seeall
thesesigns
and
wonders
which
shall
be
showed
unto
them
;
for
behold
,
they
have
been
a
chosen
peapls
of
the
Lord
;.
yea
,
the
people
of
Nephi
hath
he
loved
,
and
also
hath
he
chastened
them
;.
yea
,
inthe
days
of
theit
iniquities
:
hath
he
chastened
them
,
because
he
loveth
d
[File:471]
them
.
But
behold
.
my
bret
hren
;
the
Lamanites
hath
he
-
hated
,
because
their
dee'ds

have
.
been
evil
ontinually
;:
and
.
this
:
because
of
the
iniquity
of
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
.:
But
behold
,
salvation
hath
come
unto
them
,
through
the
:
preaching
of
the
Nephites
;
and
for
this
intent

'hath

the
Lord
,
prolonged

their'days
..
And
.
would
:
that
,
ye
should
,
behold
that
the
more
part
of
them
are
in
the
path
of
their
duty
,
and
they

do
walk
circumspectly
:
before

they
do

And

And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
many
who
heard
the
words
of
Samuel
,
the
Lamanite
,
which
he
spake
upon
the
walls
of
the
city
.
And
as
.
many
asbelieved
on
his
word
,
went
forth
and
sought
for
Nephi
;
and
when
they
had
comeforth
and
found
him
,
they
confessed
:
untohim
theirisins
and
denied
not
;
desiring
that
they
might
be
baptized
unto
the
Lord
.
But
as
many
as
there
were'
who
did
not
believe
in
the
words
of
Samuel
,
were
angry
with
him
;
and
they
cast
stones
at
him
upon
-
thewall
,
'and
also
many
shet
arrows
at
him
,
as
he
stood
upon
the
wall
;
but
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
was
with
him
,
insomuch
that
they
could
not
hit
him
with'
their
stones
;
neither
with'
their
arrows
..
Now
when
they
saw
.
this
,
that
they
could
not
hit
him
,
there
were
many'
more
who
didbelieve
on'
his
words
,
insomuch'
that
they
went
away
unto
Nephi
to
be
baptized
.
For'behold
;
Nephi
was'
baptizing
,
and
propheeying
;
and
preaching
,
crying
repentance
unto
the
peo
ple
;
shewing
signy'
and
wonders
;
working'
miracles
among
the
peopl
,
that
-
they
might
-
know
.
that
the
Christ
must
:
shortly
come
;
telling'
them
ol
things
which
must
shortly
come
,
'
that
they
might
know
and
[File:473]
remember
atthe
time
.
of
their
ecgung
thet
they
,
had
been
made
known
unto
them
beforehand
,
to
.
the
intent
that
they
might
believe
;
therefore
as
many
as
-
believed
.
on
the
words
of
Samuel
,
went
forth
.
unto
him
to
be
baptized
,
for
they
came
.
repenting
,
and
confessing
their
sins
...
But
the
more
part
of
them
did
not
believe
in
the
words
of
Samuel
;,
therefore
when
theysaw
that
they
could
not
.
hit
him
with
their
stones
and
-
their
arrows
,
they
cried
-
out
unto
.
their
.
captains
,
saying
,
take
this
fellow
.
and
bind
him
,
for
behold
,
he
bath
a
devil
;
and
because
of
the
power
ofthe
.
devil
-
which
.
is
in
him
,
we
-
cannot
hit
him
with
our
stones
)
and
.
our
arrows
;
therefore
take
him
.
and
bind
him
,
and
away
with
him
.
And
as
they
went
forth
to
lay
their
hands
.
on
him
,,
behold
,
he
did
cast
himself
down
.
from
.
the
.
wall
,
and
did
flee
out
of
their
-
lands
,
yea
,
even
unto
his
own
country
,
and
began
to
preach
and
to
prophesy
among
his
own
people
.
And
behold
,
.
he
.
was
never
heard
..
of
-
more
among
the
Nephites
;
and
thus
were
the
affairs
of
.
the
people
.
And
thus
ended
the
eighty
and
sixth
year
of
the
reign
ofthe
judges
ovyer'the
people
of
Nephi
.
And
thus
ended
,
also
,
the
eighty
and
seventh
:
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
,
the
more
part
of
the
people
.
remaining
in
their
pride
and
wickedness
;.
and
.
the
lesser
part
walking
more
circumspectly
,
before
God
...
And
Were
the
conditions
also
,
in
the
eighty
and
eighth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
judges
.
-
And
there
was
but
little
alteration

in

affairs

more
and
more
of

which

contrary
to

in

the

of

,
there
:
were
great
signs
given
unte
the

people
,
and
:
wonders
;
and
the
words
of
the
prophets
began
to
be
fulfilled
;
and
angels
did
appent
unto
meh
,
wise
men
,
and
did
declare
unto
them
glad
tidings
of
great
:
joy
;
thus
in
this
year
the
scriptures
began
to
befulfilled
,
Nevertheless
,
the
people
began
to
harden
their
hearts
,
all
save
it
were'
the
most
lieving
part
of
them
,
both
of
the
Nephites
,
ard
also
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
began
to
depend
upon
their
own
strength
,
and
upon
their
own
wisdom
,
saying
,
some
things
they
may
ve
guessed
right
,
among
so
many
;
but
behold
,
we
ow
that
all
these
great
and
marvelous
works
cannot
come
to
pass
,
of
which
has
been
spoken
.
And
they
egan
to
reason
.
and
to
contend
among
.
themselves
,
[File:474]
saying
,
that
it
is
not
-
reasoriable
that
such'a
being
as
a
Christ
shall
come
;
if
-
so
,
and
he
be
the
Son
of
God
,
the
Father
of
heaven
:
and
of
earth
,
as
it'
has'
been
spoken
,
why
will
-
he
not
shew
himself
unto
us
,
as
well
asunto'them
who
shall
be
at
Jerusalem
?
Yea
,
why
will
he
not
shew
himself
in
-
this
land
,
as
well
as
-
in
the
land
of
Jerusalem
?
But
behold
,:
we
know
:
that
this
is
a
wicked
tradition
,
which
has
been
handed
down
unto
usby
our
fathers
,.
to
cause
us
that
.
we
should
believe
in
some
great
and
marvelous
thing
which
:
should
-
come
to
-
pass
,
but
not
among'
us
,
but
in
.
a
land
which
is
far
distant
;
a
land
which
we
know
not
;
therefore
they
can
keep
us
in
ignorance
,
for
we
cannot
witness
with
our
own
eyes
that
they
are
true
.
'
And
they
will
,
bythe
cunning
and
the
mysterious
arts
of
the
evil
one
,
work
some
great'
mystery
,
which
we
-
cannot
understand
,
which
will
keep
us
down
to
beservants
to
their
words
,
and
-
also
servants
unto
them
,
for
we
depend
upon
them
to
teach
us
the
word
;
and
thus
will
they
keep
usin
ignorance
,
if
we
will
-
yield
ourselves
-
unto
them
all
the
ays
of
our
lives
.
And
many
:
more
.
things
.
did
:
the
people
imagine
up
in
their
hearts
;
which
were
foolish
and
vain
;
and
.
they
were
much
disturbed
,
for
satan
did
stir
ther
up
to
do
iniquity
continually
;
:
yea
,
he
did
about
,
spreading
rumors
and
contentions
upon
all'the
face
of
the
land
,
that
he
might
:
harden'
the
:
hearts
of
the
people
-
against
that
~which
:
was'
good
,
and
against
that
which
should
:
come
;
and
:
notwithstanding
the
signs
and
the
:
wonderswhich
were
wrought
among
the
people
of
the
Lord
,
:
and
the
many
miracles
which
they
did
;
satan
did
get
:
great
hold
upon
:
the
hearts
of
the
people
,
upon
all
the
face

thus
ended

And
-
it
came
to
pass
.
that'
in
the
commencement
of
the
ninety
and'second
:
year
,
behold
,
the
propheeies
of
the
prophets
began
to
be
fulfilled
more
fully
;
for
there
began
tobe
greater
signs
and
greater
miracles
wrought
among
the
people
.
But
there
were
some
-
who
began
to
say
,
that
the
time
was
past
:
for
the
words
to
be
fulfilled
,-
which
were
spoken
by
Samuel
,
the
Lamanite
.
And
they
began
to
rejoice
over
their
brethren
,
saying
,
behold
,
the
time
is
ast
,
and
the
-
words
of
Samuel
are
not
fulfilled
;
therefore
;
your
joy
and
your
-
faith
concerning
-
this
thing
,
hath
been
vain
.
And
it
came'to
fas
that
they
:
did
make
a
-
great
uproar
throughout
the
and
;
and
the
ee
who'
believed
,
began
to
be
very
fered
,
lest
:
by
any
means
those
things
whicli'
had
.
!
spoken
,)
might
not
come
.
to
pass
.
'
But
behold
,
they
did
wateh
steadfastly
for
that
day
,
and
that
night
,
[File:476]
and
that
day
,
which
shall
be
as
one
day
,
as
if
there
were
no
night
,
that
they
might
know
that
their
faith
had
not
been
vain
.
/
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
a
day
set
apart
by
the
unbelievers
,
that
all
those
who
believed
in
those
traditions
should
be
put
to
death
,
except
the
sign
should'come
to
pass
which
had
been
given
by
Samuel
the
prophet
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Nephi
,
the
son
of
Nephi
,
saw
this
wickedness
of
his
people
,
his
heart
was
exceeding
sorrowful
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
went
out
and
bowed
himself
down
upon
the
.
earth
,
and
cried
mightily
to
his
God
,
in
behalf
of
his
people
;
yea
,
those
who
were
about
to
be
destroyed
because
of
their
faith
in
the
tradition
of
their
fathers
.
And
it
came
to
,
pass
that
he
cried
mightily
unto
the
Lord
,
all
the
day
:
and
behold
,
the
voice
of
the
Lord
came
unto
him
,
saying
,

up
your
head

into

to

unto

that
I
will

it
came
to
pass
that
the
words
which
came
unto
Nephi
were
fulfilled
;-
according
as
they
had
been
spoken
:
for
behold
at
the
going
down
of
the
sun
,
there
was
no
darkness
;
and
the
people
began
to
be
astonished
,
because
there
was
no
darknesswhen
.
the
night
came
.
And
there
were
many
who
had
not
believed
the
words
of
the
.
prophets
,
fell
to
the
earth
,
and
became
as
:
if
they
were
dead
,
for
they
knew
that
:
the
great
ea
of
destruction
which
they
had
laid
-
for
those
who
believed
in
the
word
of
the
prophets
,
had
been
.
frustrated
,
for
the
signal
which
had
been
given
was
already
.
at
hand
;
and
they
:
began
to
know'
that
the
Son
of
God
must
shortly
appear
;
yea
,
in
fine
,
all
the
people
upon
the
face
of

exceedingly
astonished
,
that
Shey
fell
to
.
the
earth
;
for
they
knew
that
.
the
prophets
had
testified
:
of
:
shen
things
for
many
,
years
,
and
that
the
:
sign
wwhich
he
[File:477]
been
given
;
wag
already
at
hand
;
and
they
began
to
fear
Secshea
of
their
iniquity
and
their
unbelief
.
And
it/came
to
pass
that
there
was
no
darkness
in
.
all
that
night
,
but
it
was
as
light
as
though
it
was
mid
-
day
.
And
it
came
to
-
pass
that
the
sun
did
rise
inthe
morning
again
,
aceording
to
its
proper
order
;
and
they
knew
-
that
it
was
the
day
that
the
Lord
should
be
born
,
because
of
the
sign
which
had
been
given
.
.
And
it
had
come
:
to
pass
,
yea
,
all
things
,
every
whit
,
aceording
to
the
words
of
the
prophets
.
And
it
came
to
puss
also
,
that
a
new
star
did
appear
,
according
to
the
word
.
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
from
this
time
forth
,
there
began
to
be
lyings
sent
forth
among
the
people
,
by
satan
,
to
harden
their
hearts
,
to
the
intent
that
they
m
ght
not
believe
in
those
signs
and
wonders
which
they
had
seen
;
but
notwitstandmg
these
lyings
anddeceivings
,
the
more
part
of
the
people
did
believe
;
and
Were
converted
unto
.
the
Lord
.
And
:
it
came
:
to
pass
that
Nephi
went
forth
among
the
people
,
and
also
many
others
,
baptizing
unto
repentance
,
in
the
which
,
there
were
a
great
remission
of
sins
.
And
thus
the
people
began
again
to
have
peace
in
the
land
;
and
thete
were
no
contentions
,
save
it
were
a
few
that
began
to
preach
,
endeavoring
to
prove
by
the
scriptures
,
that
it
was
no
more
expedient
to
observe
the
law
of
Moses
:
-
Now
:
in
-
this
thing
they
did
err
,
having
not
anderstood
the
scriptures
.
But
it
came
to
pass
that
they
soon
became
converted
,
and
were
convinced
of
the
error
which
they
were
in
,
for
it
was
made
known
unto
them
thatthe
law
.
was
not
yet
fulfilled
and
that
it
must
be
fulfilled
in
every
whit
:
yea
,
the
word
came
unto
them
that
it
must
be
.
fulfilled
;
yea
,
that
one
jot
nor
title
should
:
not
-
pass
atway
,
till
it
should
all
be
.
fulfilled
;
thereforein
this
same
year
,
were
they
brought
toa
koowledge
of
their
error
,
and
did
confess
their
faulte
.
And
thas
the
ninety
and
:
second
year
did
pass
areyy
bringing
glad
-
tiding
unto
the
people
because
.
of
a
.
which
-
did
come
.
to
pass
,
according
to
the
words
ithe
prophecy
ofall
the
holy
prophets
.
And
if
:
cama
to
pass
that
the
ninety
and
third
Pac
ad
did
also
.
pass'away
in
peace
,
save
it
were
for
the
anton
robbers
,
who
:
dwelt
-
upon
the
mountains
,
who
did
infest
the
land
;
for
so
strong
-
were
their
holds
and
their
secret
places
;
\that
the
people
could'not
overpower
)
them
;
therefore
.
they
did
commit
.
many
.
murders
;
and
did
dormuch
slaughter
among
the
people
.
And
ieame
:
to'
pass
that
ihy
the
ninety
and
fourth
year
,
[File:478]
they
began
.
to
increase
in
.
a
great
degree
,.
because
there
were
many
dissenters
of
the
Nephites
who
did
flee
unto
:
them
,
which
did
cause
.
much
.
sorrow
unto
-
those
:-
Nephites
who
did
remain
in
the
Jand
;
and
there
was
also
a
cause
of
.
much
sorrow
among
the
Lamanites
:
for
be
-:
hold
,
they
had
many
children
who
.
did
grow
.
up
and
began
to
wax
strong
in
years
,
that
they
became
for
them
:
selves
,
and
were
led
away
by
some
.
who
were
Zoramites
,
by
their
lyings
and
their
flattering
words
;
to
join
those
Gadianton
:
robbers
;
and
.
thus
were
the
Lamanites
afflicted
also
,
and
began
to
decrease
as
to
their
faith
and
righteousness
,
.
because
,
of
the
wickedness
of
the
rising
generation
.
..
-,
:
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
thus
passed
away
the
nine
.
ty
and
fifth
year_also
,
and
the
people
began
to
forget
ces
signs
and
wonders
which
they
had
heard
,
and
began
tobe
less
and
less
,
astonished

from
heaven
,
insomuch
that
they
began
to
be
hard
in
their
harts
,
and
blind
in
their
minds
,
and
began
to
disbelieve
all
which
.
they
had
heard
and
seen
,
imagining
up
some
vain
thing
in
their
hearts
,
that
it
.
was'
wrought

by

men
,
and
by
the
power
of
the
.
devil
;
to
:
lead
away
.
and
deceive
the
hearts
-
of
the
people
;
and
thus
did
satan
get
possession
of
the
hearts
of
the
pecple
again
,
insomuch
that
he
did
blind
their
eyes
,
and
lead
them
away
to
believe
that
the
doctrine
:
of
Christ
was
afoolish
and
a
-
vain
thing
.
=
...
;
;
And
it
came
:
to
pass
that
the
people
.
began
to
wax
strong
.
in
wickedness
and
abominations
;
and
they
did
not
believe
that
there
should
be

them

And
it
came
to
-
pass
that
the
people
did
still
remain
in
wickedness
,
notwithstanding
the
much
preaching
and
prophesying
which
was
sent
among
them
;
and
thus
passed
away
the
tenth
year
also
;
and
the
eleventh
year
also
passed
away
in
iniquity
.
And
it
came
to
in
.
the
thirteenth
year
,
there
began
to
be
wars
on
)
wnieatiion
throughout
all
the
land
:
for
the
Gadianton
robbers
had
become
so
numerous
.
and
did
slay
somany
of
the
people
,
and
did
lay
wasteso
many
cities
,
and
did
spread
go
much
death
and
carnage
throughout
the
land
,
that
it
beeame
expedient
that
all
the
people
,
.
both
the
Nephites
,
and
the
Lamanites
,
should
take
-
up
arms
against
them
;
therefore
all
the
Lamanites
who
.
had
become
converted
unto
the
Lord
,
did
unite
with
their
brethren
,
the
Nephites
,
and
were
compelled
,
for
the
safety
of
their
lives
,
and
their
women
and
their
children
,
to
take
up
arms
against
those
Gadianton
robbers
;
yea
,
and
also
to
maintain
their
rights
,
and
their
privileges
of
their
church
,
and
of
their
worship
,
and
their
freedom
,
and
their
liberty
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
before
this
thirteenth
year
had
passed
away
,
the
Nephites
were
threatened
with
utter
destruction
,
because
of
this
war
,
which
had
become
exceetling
sore
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
those
Lamanites
who
had
united
with
the
Nephites
;
were
numbered
among
the
.
Nephites
:
and
their
curse
was
taken
from
them
,
and
their
skin
became
white
like
unto
the
Nephites
;.
and
their
young
men
and
their
daughters
became
exceeding
fair
,
and
they
were
riutmbered
among
the
Nephitea
,
and
were
called
Nephites
,
And
thus
ended

And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
commencement
of
theâ
fourteenth
year
,
the
war
between
the
robbers
and
the
people
of
Nephi
did
.
continue
,
and
did
become
exceed

ing
sore
;
nevertheless
,
the
people
of
Nephi
did
gain
.
some
advantage
of
the
robbers
insomuch
that
they
did
drive
them
back
out
-
of
their
lands
into
the
mountains
,
and
into
their
seeret

places
.
And
thus
ended
the
fourteenth
year
.
And
.
in
the
fifteenth
year
they
did
come
forth
against
the
people
of
Nephi
;

the
wickedness

their

the
Gadjanton

And
behold

Lam
Giddiantl
:
and
I
am
the
governor
of
this
the
secret
society
of
Gadianton
;
which
society
,
and
the'
works
thereof
,
I
know
to
be
good
;
and
they
are
of
ancient
date
,
and
they
have
been
handed
down
unto
us
.
And
I
write
this
epistle
unto
you
,
Lachoneus
,
and
{
hope
that
ye
will
deliver
up
your
lands
,
and

possessions
,
without

shedding
of

,
that
this
my
people
may
recover
their
rights
and
government
who
have
dissented
away
from
you

because
of
your
wickedness
in
retaining
from
them
their

of

ment
;
and
except
ye
do'
this
,
1
:
will
avenge
their
wrongs
.
I
am
Giddianhi
.
;
And
now
it
came
to
pass
when
Lachoneus
received
this
epistle
,
he
was
exceedingly
astonished
,
because
of
the
boldness
of
Giddianhi
,
demanding
the
possession
ofthe
land
of
the
Nephites
;
and
also
of
threatening
the
people
and
avenging
the
wrongs
of
those
that
had'
received
no
wrong
,
saveit
were
they
had
wronged
themselves
,
by
dissenting
away
unto
those
wicked
and
-
abominable
robbers
.
Now
behold
,
this
Lachoneus
,
the
governor
,
was'a
just
man
,
and
could
not
be
frightened
by
the
demands
and
the
threatenings
of
arobber
;
therefore
he
did
not
hearken
to
the'
epistle
of
Giddianhi

And
so
greatand
marvelous
were
_
the
words
and
prophecies
of
Lachoneus
,
that
they
did
cause
fear
to
come
upon
all
the
people
,
and
they
did
exert
themselves
in
their
might
,
to
doaccording
to
the
words
of
Lachoneus
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Lachoneus
did
appoint
chief
captains
over
all
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
,
to
command
them
at
the
time
that
the
robbers
should
~
come
down
out
of
the
wilderness
against
them
.
Now
the
chiefest
amongall
the
captains
,
and
the
great
commander
of
all
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
,
was
-
appointed
,
and
hisname
was
Gidgiddoni
.
Now
it
was
the
custom
among
all
the
Nephites
,
to
appoint
for
their
chief
captains
,
save
it
were
in
their
times
of
wickedness
,
some
one
that
had
the
spirit
of
revelation
,
and
also
prophecy
;
therefore
this
Gidgiddoni
.
was
a
great
prophet
among
them
,
and
also
.
was
the
chief

Now
the
people
said
unto
Gidgiddoni
,
pray
unto
t
Lord
,
and
let
us
go
up
upon
the
mountains
,
and
into
the
wilderness
,
that
we
may
fall
upon
the
robbers
and
destroy
them
,
in
their
own
lands
,
But
Gidgiddoni
saith
unto
them
,
the
Lord
forbid
;
for
if
we
should
go
up
against
them
,
the
Lord
would
deliver
us
into
their
hands
;
therefore
we
will
prepare
ourselyes
in
the
centre
of
our
lands
,
and
we
will
gather
all
our
armies
together
,
and
we
will
not
.
go
against
them
,
but
we
will
wait
till
they
shall
come
against
us
;
therefore
as
the
Lord
liveth
,
if
we
do
this
,
he
will
deliver
them
into
our
hands
.
And
it
came
:
to
pass
in
the
seventeenth
year
,
in
the
latter
end
.
of
the
year
,
the
proclamation
of
Lachoneus
had
gone
forth
throughout
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
they
had
taken
.
their
horses
,
and
their
chariots

and
their
eattle
,
and
all
their
flocks
,
and
their

and
their

and
all

,
and
did
march
forth
by
thousands
;
and
by

of
thousands
,
until
they
had
all
:
gone
forth
to
the
place
which
had
been
appointed
,
that
they
should
gather
themselves
together
,
to

against

the

,
because
of
the

great
.
curse
which
yas
upon
the
land
northward
;
and
they
did
tortify
themselves
against
their
enemies
;
and
they
did
dwell
in
one
lund
,.
and
in
one
body
,
and
they
did
fear
the
words
-
which
had
been
spoken
by
Lachoneus
,
insomuch
that
they
did
repent
of
all
their
sins
;
and
they
.
did
put
up
their
prayers
unto
the
Lord
their
God
,
that
he
would
deliever
them
in
the
time
that
their
enemies
should
come
down
against
then
to
battle
,
And
they
were
exceeding
sorrowful
because
of
their
enemy
.
And
Gidgiddoni
did
cause
that
they
should
make
weapons
of
war
,
of
every
kind
,
that
they
should
be
strong
with
armor
,
and
with
shields
,
and
with
bucklers
,
after
the
manner
of
his
instruction
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
latter
end
of
the
eighteenth
year
,
those
armies
of
robbers
,
had
prepared
for
battle
,
and
began
to
come
down
,
and
to
sally
forth
from
the
hills
,
and
out
of
the
mountains
,
and
the
wilderness
,
and
their
strong
holds
,
and
their
secret
places
,
and
began
to
take
possession
of
the
lands
,
both
which
was
in
the
land
south
,
and
which
was
inthe
land
north
,
and
began
to
take
possession
of
all
the
lands
which
had
been
deserted
by
the
Nephites
,
and
the
cities
which
had
been
left
desolate
.
But
behold
there
were
no
wild
beasts
nor
game
.
in
those
lands
which
had
been
deserted
by
the
Nephites
,
and
there
Wag
no
game
for
the
robbers
save
it
were
in
the
wilderness
.
And
the
robbers
could
not
exist
save
it
were
in
the
wilderness
,
for
the
want
-
of
food
:
for
the
Nephites
had
left
their
lands
desolate
,
and
had
gathered
their
ocks
,
and
their
herds
and
all
their
substance
,
and
they
were
in
.
one
body
;
therefore
there
was
no
chance
for
the
robbers
to
plunder
and
to
-
obtain
food
,
save
it
were
to
.
come
.
up
in
open
.
battle
against
the
Nephites
;
and
the
Nephites
being
in
one
body
,
and
having
.
so
great
a
number
,
and
having
reserved
for
themselves
revisions
,
and
horses
,
and
cattle
,
and
flocks
of
every
ind
,
that
they
might
subsist
for
the
space
of
seven
years
,
in
the
which
time
they
did
hope
to
destroy
the
robbers
from
off
the
face
of
the
land
.
And
thus
the
eighteenth
year
did
pass
away
.
Seo
,
And
it
came
to
pags
that
in
the
nineteenth
year
,
Gidddianhi
.
found
that
it
was
expedient
that
he
.
should
80
up
to
battle
against
the
Nephites
,
for
there
was

no
bie
that
they
could

save
it
were
to

and

And
,
they
durst

not

spread
themselves
upon
the
face

of
the
land
,
insomuch
that
.
[File:484]
they
could
raise
grain
,
lest
the
Nephites
should
come
apon
them
and
slay
them
;
therefore
Giddianhi
gave
commandment
unto
his
armies
,
that
in
this
year
they
should
go
up
to
battle
against
the
Nephites
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
come
up
to
battles
and
it
was
in
the
sixth
month
;
and
behold
,
great
and
terrile
was
the
day
that
they
did
come
up
to
battle
;
and
they
were
girded
about
after
the
manver
of
robbers
;
and
they
had
a
lamb
-
skin
about
their
loins
;
and
they
were
died
in
blood
;
and
their
heads
were
shorn
;
and
they
had
head
-
plates
upon
them
;
and
great
and
terrible
was'the
appearance
of
the
armies
of
Giddianhi
,
because
of
their
armor
,
and
because
of
their
being
dyedin
blood
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
arinies
of
the
Nephites
,
when
they
saw
the
appearance
of
the
army
of
Giddianhi
,
had
all
fallen
to
the
earth
,
and
did
lift
their
cries
to
the
Lord
their
God
,
that
he
would
spare
them
,
and
deliver
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
.
And
it
came
to
-
pass
that
when
the
armies
of
Giddianhi
saw
this
,
they
began
to
shout
with
aloud
voice
,
because
of
their
joy
;
for
they
had
supposed
that
the
Nephites
had
fallen
with
fear
,
because
of
the
terror
of
their
armies
;
but
in
this
thing
they
were
disap
ointed
,
for
the
Nephites
did
not
fear
them
,
but
they
id
fear
their
God
,
and
did
supplicate
him
for
protection
;
therefore
when
the
armies
of
Giddianhi
did
rosh
upon
them
,
they
were
prepared
to
meet
them
;
yea
,
in
the'
strength
of
the
Lord
they
did
receive
them
;
and
the
battle
commenced
in
this
the
sixth
month
;
and
great
and
terrible
was
thebattle
thereof
;
yea
,
great
and
terrible
was
the
slaughter
thereof
,
insomuch
that
there
never
was
kriown
so
great
a
slaughter
among
all
the
people
of
Lehi'since''
he
left
Jerusalem
.
And
notwithstanding
the
threatninigs
and'
the
oaths
which
Giddianhi
had
made
,
behold

the

did
beat

And
it

and
the
robbers
did
not
come

to

neither
did

they
come

in

the
twentieth
year
;
and
in
the
twenty
and
first
year
they
did
not
come

up
.
to
battle
,
but
they
.
came
.
up
on
all
sides
,
to
lay
:
siege
:
round
about
the
people
of
Nephi
;
for
they
did
suppose
that
if
they
should
cut
off
the
people
of
Nephi
from
their
lands
,
and
should
hem
them
in
.
on
every
side
,
and
if
they
should
cut
them
off
from
all
their
outward
privileges
,
that
they
.
could
cause
them
to
yield
themselves
up
according
.
to
.
their
wishes
.
Now
they
had
appointed
.
unto
.
themselves
another
leader
,
whose
name
was
Zemnarihah
;
therefore
it
was
Zemnarihah
that
did
cause
that
this
,
siege
should
take
place
.
But
behold
this
was
an
advantage
to
the
Nephites
;
for
it
was
impossible
for
the
robbers
to
lay
siege
sufficiently
long
to
have
any
effect
.
upon
the
:
Nephites
,
because
of
their
much
provision
which
they
had
laid
up
in
store
,
because
of
the
scantiness
of
provisions
among
the
robbers
;
for
behold
they
had
nothing
save
it
were
meat
.
for
their
subsistence
,
which
meat
they
did
obtain
in
the
wilderness
..
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
wild
game
became
scarce
.
in
.
the
.
wilderness
,
insomuch
that
the
robbers
were
about
.
to
perish
with
hunger
.
And
the
Nephites
were
continually
marching
out
by
day
and
by
night
,
and
,
falling
upon
their
armies
,
and
.
cutting
them
off
by
thousands
and
by
tens
of
thousands
.
And
thus
it
became
the
desire
of
the
people
of
Zemnarihah
,
to
withdraw
:
from
their
,
design
,
because
of
the
great
destruction
Which
come
upon
them
by
night
and
by
day
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Zemnarihah
did
give
com

mand
.
unto
his
people
,
that
.
they
.
should
withdraw
:
themselves
from

,

And

being
aware
of
their
design
;
and
knowing

of
their
weakness
.
because
of
the
want
of
food
,
and
the
great
slaughter
which
had
been
made
among
them
,
therefore
he
.
did
send
out
his
armies
in
.
the
night
time
,:
and
did
cut
off
the
way
of

,
and
did

so
that
on

,
when

the

began
their

,
they

of

Nephites
,
bothin'
their

:

.
And
the
robbers
who
were
on
the
south
,
were
also
cut
off
in
their
places
of
retreat
.
And
all
these
things
were
done
by
command
of
Gidgiddoni
.
And
there
were
many
thousands
who
did
yield
themselves
ap
prisoners
unto
the
Nephites
;
and
the
remainder
of
them
were
slain
;
and
their
leader
,
Zemnarihah
,
wag
taken
,
and
hanged
upon

tree
,
yea
,
even
upon
the
top
thereof
,
until

was

...
And
when
they
had
hanged
him
until
he
was
dead
,
they
did
fall
the
tree
to
the
earth
,
and
did
ery
with
a
loud
voice
,
saying
,
may
the
Lord
preserve
his
people
in
righteousness
and
in
holiness
of
heart
,
that
they
may
cause
to
be

earth
all
who
shall
seek
to
slay
them
because
of
pow
.
er
and
secret
combipations
,
even
as
this
man
hath
been
fell
to
the
earth
.
And
they
did
rejuice
and
cry
egain
with
one
voice
,
saying
,
may
the
God
of
Abraham
,
and
the
God
of
Isaac
,
and
the
God
of
Jacob
,
protect
this
people
in
righteousness
,
so
long
as
they
shall
call
.
on
the
name
of
their
God
for
protection
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
break
forth
,
all
as
one
,
in
singing
and
praising
their
God
,
for
the
great
thing
which
he
had
done
for
then
,
in
preserving
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
their
enemies
:
yea
,
they
did
ery
,
hosanna
to
the
Most
High
God
;
and
they
did
ery
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Lord
God
Almighty
,
the
Most
High
God
.
And
their
hearts
were
swollen
with
joy
,
unto
the
gushing
out
of
may
tears
,
because
of
the
great
goodness
of
God
in
delivering
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
enemies
;
and
they
knew
it
was
because
of
their
repentance
and
their
humility
that
they
had
been
delivered
from
an
everlasting
destruction
,
And
-
now
behold
there
was
not
a
living
soul
among
all
the
people
of
the
Nephites
,
who
did
doubt
in
the
least
the
words
of
all
the
holy
prophets
who
had
spoken
;
for
they
knew
that
it
must
needs
be
that
they
must
be
fulfilled
:
and
they
knew
that
it
must
be
expedient
that
Christ
had
come
,
because
of
the
many
signs
which
had
been
given
,
according
to
.
the
words
of
the
prophets
,
and
because
of
the
things
which
had
come
to
pass
already
,
they
knew
that
it
must
needs
be
that
all
things
should
come
to
pass
according
to
that
which
had
been
spoken
;
therefore
they
did
forsake
all
their
:
sins
,
and
their
abominations
,
and
their
whore
os
,
and
did
serve
God
with
all

And
tow
it
ame
to
pass
that
when
they
had
taken
:
ali
the
robbers
prisoners
,
insomuch
that
none
did
:
escape
who
were
not
slain
,
they
did
cast
their
prisonets
into
prison
,
and
did
cause
the
word
of
God
to
be
preached
unto
them
;
and
as
many
as
would
repent
of
their
sins
and
enter
into
a
covenant
that
they
would
murder
no
more
,
were
set
at
liberty
;
but
as
many
as
there
were
who
did
not
enter
into
a
covenant
,
and
who
did
still
continue
to
have
those
secret
murders
in
their
hearts
;
yea
,
a8
many
as
-
were
found
breathing
-
out
threatnings
against
their
brethren
,
were
condemned
and
punished
according
to
the
law
.
And
thus
they
did
put
an
end
to
all
those
wicked
,.
and
secret
,
and
abominable
combinations
,
in
the
which
there
was
so
mach
wickedness
,
and
so
many
murders
committed
.
.
And
thus
had
the
twenty
and
second
year
passed
away
,
and
the
twenty
and
third
year
also
,
and
the
twenty
and
fourth
,
and
the
twenty
and
fifth
:
and
thus
had
twenty
and
five
years
passed
away
,
and
there
had
many
things
transpired
which
,
in
the
eyes
of
some
,
would
be
great
and
marvelous
;
nevertheless
,
they
cannot
all
be
written
in
this
book
;
yea
,
this
book
cannot
contain
even
a
hundredth
-
part
of
what
was
done
among
80
many
people
,
in
the
space
of
twenty
and
five
years
;
but
behold
there
are
records
which
do
contain
all
the
proceedings
of
this
people
;
and
a
more
short
but
a
true
account
was
given
by
Nephi
;
therefore
]
have
made
my
record
of
these
things
according
tothe
record
of
Nephi
,
which
was
engraven
on
the
lates
which
were
called
the
plates
of
Nephi
.
And
hold
1
do
make
the
record
on
plates
which
I
have
made
with
mine
own
hands
.
And
behold
,
am
called
Mormon
,
being
called
after
the
land
of
Mormon
,
the
land
in
the
which
Alma
did
establish
the
church
among
the
people
;
yea
,
the
first
church
which
was
established
among
thetn
after
their
transgression
.
Behold
I
am
a
disciple
of
Jesus
Christ
,
the
Son
of
God
.
Thave
been
called
of
him
to
declare
his
word
among
his
people
,
that
they
might
have
everlasting
life
..
And
it
hath
become
expedient
that
I
,
according
to
the
will
of
God
,
that
the
prayers
of
those
who
have
gone
hence
,
who
were
the
holy
ones
,
should
be
fulfilled
according
to
their
faith
,
should
make
a
record
of
these
things
which
have
been
done
;
yea
,
a
small
record
of
which
hath
taken
place
from
the
time
that
Lehi
et
Jerusalem
,
even
down
until
the
present
time
;
therefore
I
do
:
make
my
record
from
the
accounts
[File:488]
which
have
.
been
given
by
those
who
.
were
,
before
me
,
until

commencement
of
my

day
;
and
.
then
I
do
make

a
record
of
the
.
things
.
which
.
I
have
seen
with
mine
own
eyes
.
AndJ
know
the
record
,
which

{
make
to
be
a
just

and
a
irue
record

nevertheless
there
are
many
things
.
which
,
according

to
our

lan

guage
,
we
are
not
,
able
to
write
.
And
now
I
make
an
end
of
my
saying
which
is
of
myself
,
and
proceed
to
give
my
account
of
the
things
which
have
been
before

am

Mormon
,
and
.
a
pure
:
descendant
of
Lehi
..
I
have
reason
to
bless
my
God
,
and
my
Savior
Jesus
Christ
,
that
he
brought
.
our
fathers
out
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
(
and
no
one
knew
it
.
save
it
were
himself
and
those
whoin
he
brought
out
of
that
land
,)
and
that
he
hath
given
me
and
my
people
so
much
knowledge
unto
the
salvation
of
our
souls
.
Surely
he
bath
blessed
the
house
of
Jacob
,
and
hath
been
merciful
unto
the
seed
of
Joseph
.
And
insomuch
as
the
children
of

.
Lehi
have
kept
his
commandments
,
he
hath
blessed
them
and
prospered
them
according
to
his
word
;
yea
,
and
surely
shall
he
again
bring
a
remnant

of
the
seed
of

Joseph
to

the
knowledge
of
the
Lord

their
God
;
and
as
surely
as
the
Lord
liveth
will
he
gatherin
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
earth
,
all
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
Jacob
,
who
are
scattered
abroad
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
;
and
as
he
hath
covenanted
with
all
the
house
of
Jacob
,
even
so
shall
the
covenant
where
:
with
he
hath
covenanted
with

house
of
Jacob
,
be
fulfilled
.
in
his
own
due
time
,
unto
the
restoring
all
the
house
of
Jacob
unto
the
knowledge
of
the
covenant
that
he
hath
covenanted
wilh
them
;
and
then
shall
they
know
their
Redeemer
,
,
who
is
Jesus
Christ
,
the
Son
of
God
;
and
then
shall
they
be
gathered
in
from

four
quarters

of

unto

from
whence

CHAPTER
III
.
_
Ann
now
,
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
the
Nephites
did
allreturn
to
their
own
lands
,
in
the
twenty
and
sixth
.
year
,
every
man
,
with
his
family
,
his
flocks
and
his
herds
,
hie
horses
and
his
.
cattle
,
and
all
things
[File:489]
whatsoever
did
belong
unto
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
had
not
eaten
up
all
their
provisions
;
therefore
they
did
take
with
them
all
that
they
had
not
devoured
,
of
all
their
grain
of
every
kind
,
and
their
gold
,
and
their
silver
,
and
all
their
precious
things
,
and
they
did
return
to
their
own
lands
and
their
possessions
,
bothi
on
the
north
and
on
the
south
,
both
on
the
land
northward
and
on
the
land
southward
.
And
they
granted
unto
those
robbers
who
had
entered
into
a
covenant
to
keep
the
peace
,
of
the
band
who
were
desirous
to
remain
Lamanites
,
lands
,
according
to
their
numbers
,
that
they
might
have
,
with
their
labors
;
wherewith
tosubsist
upon
;
and
thus
they
did
establish
peace
in
all
the
land
.
And
they
began
again
to
prosperand
to
wax
great
;
and
the
twenty
and
sixth
and
seventh
years
passed
away
,
and
there
was
great
order
in
the
land
;
and
they
had
formed
their
laws
according
to
sey
and
justice
.
And
now
there
was
nothing
in
all
the
land
,
to
hinder
the
people
from
prospering
contually
,
except
they
shou
!
d
fall
into
transgression
..
And
now
it'
was
Gidgiddoni
,
and
the
judge
Lachoneus
,
and
those
who
had
been
appointed
leaders
,
who
had
established
this
great
peace
in
the
land
.
a
And
it
came
to
puss
that'
there
were
many
cities
built
anew
,
and
there
were
many
old
cities
repaired
;
and
there
were
many
highways
cast
up
;
and
many
rads
made
,
which
led
from
city
to
city
,
and
from
land
toland
,
and
from
place
to
place
.
And
thus
passed
away
the
twenty
and
eighth
year
,
and
the
people
had
continual
peace
.
But
it
came
to
pass
in
the
twenty
and
ninth
year
,
there
began
to
be
some
disputings
atnong
the
people
;
and
some
were
lifted
up
unto
pride
and
boastings
,
because
of
their
exceeding
great
riches
,
yea
,
even
unto
great
persecutions
:
for
there
were
ma~
ty
merchants
in
the
land
,
and'also
many
lawyers
,
and
many
officers
.
And
the
people
began
to
be
distinfulshed
by
ranks
,
acording
to
their
riches
,
and
their
chances
for
learning
;
yea
,
some
were
ignorant
because
of
their
poverty
,
and
others
did
receive
great
learning
because
of
their
riches
;
some
were
lifted
up
inâ
pride
,
and
others
were
exceeding
humble
;
some
did'
return
tailing
for
railing
,
while
others
would
receive
railing
,
ahd
persecation
,
and
all'ianner
of
afflictions
,
and
woul
Not
torn
and'revile
again
,
but
were
humble
and
i
e
)
litent'
before
God
:
and
thus
there
became
:
a
great
inequality
in
all
the
land
,
insomuch
that
the
church
gan
to
bebroken
wp
;
yea
)
insomuch
that
in
the
thir
[File:490]
tieth
year
the
church
was
broken

upin
,
all
the
Jand
,
save
it
were
.
among
a
few
.
of
the
Lamanites
,
who
were
converted
unto
the
true
faith
;
and
they
would
not
de
.
part
from
it
,
for
they
were
firm
,
and
steadfast
,
and
im
.
movable
,
willing
with
all
dilligence
to
keep
the
com
.
mandinents
of
the
Lord
.
Now
the
cause
of
this
iniquity
of
the
people
,
was
this
,
satan
had
great
power
,
unto
the
stirring
up
of
the
people
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
,
and
tothe
puffing
them
up
with
pride
,
tempt
.
ing
them
.
to
seek
for
power
,
and
authority
,
and
riches
,
and
the
vain
things
of
the
world
.
And
thussatan
did
lead
away
the
hearts
of
the
people
,
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
;
therefore
they
had
not
enjoyed
peace
buta
few
years
.
And
thus
in
the
commencement
of
the
thirtieth
year
,
the
people
having
been
delivered
up
for
thespace
of
along
time
,
to
be
carried
about
by
the
temptations
of
the
devil
whithersoever
he
desired
to
carry
them
,
and
to
do
whatsoever
iniquity
he
desired
they
should
;
and
thus
in
the
commencement
of
this
,
the
thirtieth
year
,
they
were
in
a
state
of
awful
wickedness
.
Now
they
did
not
sin
ignorantly
,
for
they
knew
the
will
of
God
concerning
them
,
for
it
had
been
taught
unto
them
;
therefore
they
did
wilfully
rebel
against
God
.
And
now
it
was
in
the
days
of
Lacho
neus
,
the
son
of
Lachoneus
,
for
Lachoneus
did
fill
the
seat
of
his
father
and
did
govern
the
people
that
year
.
And
there
began
to
be
men
inspired
from
heaven
,
and
sent
furth
,
standing
among
the
people
in
all
the
land
,
preaching
and
testifying
boldly
of
the
sins
and
iniqu'
ties
of
the
people
,
and
testifying
unto
them
concern
ing
the
redemption
which
the
Lord
would
make
for
his
people
;
or
in
other
words
,
the
resurrection
of
Christ
;
and
they
did
testify
boldly
of
his
death
and
sufferings
.
Now
there
were
many
of
the
people
who
were
exceeding
angry
,
because
of
those
who
testified
of
these
things
;
and
those
who
were
angry
,
were
chief
ly
thechief
judges
,
and
they
who
had
been
high
priests
and
lawyers
;
yea
,
all
those
who
were
lawyers
,
were
angry
with
those
who
testified
of
these
things
.
Now
there
was
no
lawyer
,
nor
judge
,
nor
high
priest
,
that
could
have
power
to
condemn
any
.
one
to
death
,
save
their
condemnation
was
signed
by
the
governor
of
the
land
.
Now
there
were
many
of
those
who
testified
of
the
things
.
pertaining
to
Christ
,
who
testified
boldly
,
who
were
taken
and
put
to
death
secretly
by
the
judg
:
es
,
that
the
knowledge
of
their
death
came
not
unte
the
governor
of
the
land
,
until
after
their
death
.
Now
[File:491]
behold
this
:
was
contrary
to
the
laws
.
of
.
the
land
,
that
any
man
should
be
put
to
death
,
except
they
had
power
from
the
governor
of
the
land
;
therefore
a
coreplaint
came
up
unto
the
land
of
Zarahemla
,
to
the
governor
of
the
land
,
against
these
judges
who
had
condemned
the
prophets
of
the
Lord
unto
death
,
not
according
to
the
law
.
Now
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
taken
and
brought
up
before
the
judge
,
to
be
judged
of
the
crime
which
they
had
done
,
according
to
the
law
which
had
been
given
by
the
people
.
Now
it
,
eame
to
pass
that
those
judges
had
many
friends
and
kimdreds
:
and
the
remainder
,
yea
,
even
almost
all
the
lawyers
and
the
high
priests
,
did
gather
themselves
together
,
and
unite
with
the
kindreds
of
those
judges
who
were
to
be
tried
according
to
the
law
;
and
they
did
enter
intoa
covenant
one
with
another
,
yea
,
even
into
that
covenant
whieh
was
given
by
them
of
old
,
which
covenant
was
given
and
administered
by
the
devil
,
to
combine
against
all
righteousness
;
therefore
they
did
combine
against
the
people
of
the
Lord
,
and
enter
into
a
covenant
to
destroy
them
,
and
to
deliver
those
who
were
guilty
of
murder
from
the
grasp
of
justice
,
which
was
about
to
be
administered
according
to
the
law
.
And
they
did
set
at
defiance
the
law
and
the
rights
of
their
country
;
and
they
did
covenant
,
one
with
another
,
to
destro
the
governor
,
and
to
establish
a
king
over
the
land
,
that
the
land
should
no
more
be
at
liberty
,
but
should
be
subject
unto
kings
.
Now
behold
,
will
shew
unto
i
that
they
did
not
establish
a
king
over
the
land
;
ut
in
this
same
year
,
yea
,
the
thirtieth
year
,
they
did
destroy
upon
the
judgment
seat
,
yea
,
did
murder
the
chief
judge
of
the
land
.
And
the
people
were
divided
one
against
another
;
and
they
did
separate
one
from
another
,
into
tribes
,
every
man
according
to
his
fami
.
ly
,
and
his
kindred
and
friends
;
and
thus
they
did
destroy
the
government
of
the
land
.
And
every
tribe
did
appoint
-
a
chief
,
or
a
leader
over
them
;
and
thus
the
became
tribes
,
and
leaders
of
tribes
.
Now
behold
,
there
was
no
man
among
them
,
save
he
had
much
family
and
many
kindredsand
friends
;
therefore
their
tribes
becameiexceeding
great
..
Now
all
this
was
done
and
there
were
no
wars
ag
yet
among
them
;
and
all
this
iniquity
had
:
come
upon
the
people
,
because
they
did
yield
themselves
unto
the
power
of
satan
;
and
the
ations
of
the
government
were
destroyed
,
because
the
secret
combination
of
the
friends
and
kindreds
of

those
who
;
murdered'the
prophets
.
And
they
did
cause
a
great
contention
in
the
Jand
,
insomuch
thatthe
:
more
righteous
part
of
the
people
,
although
they
had
nearly
all
become
wicked
;
yea
,
there
were
but
:
few
righteous
men
among
them
.
And
thus
six
years
had
.
not
passed
away
,
since
the
more
part
of
the
people
had
turned
from
their
righteousness
,
like
the
dog
tu
his
vomit
,
or
like
the
sow
to
her
wallowing
in
the
mire
.
Now
this
secret
combination
which
had
brought
so
great
iniquity
upon
the
people
,-
did
gather
themselves
together
,
and
did
place
at
their
head
a
man
whom
they
did
call
Jacob
;
and
they
did
m
their
king
;
therefore
he
became
a
king
over
this
wicked
band
;
and
he
was
one
of
the
chiefest
who
had
.
given
his
voice
against
the
prophets
who
testified
of
Jesus
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
not
so
strong
in
number
as
the
-
tribes
of
the
people
who
were
united
together
,
save
it
were
their
leaders
did
establish
their
laws
,
every
one
according
to
his
tribe
;
nevertheless
they
were
enemies
,
notwithstanding
they
were
not
a
righteous
people
;
yet
they
were
united
in
the
hatred
:
of
those
who
had
entered
into
a
covenant
to
destroy
the
government
;
therefore
Jacob
seeing
that
their
enemies
were
more
numerous
than
they
,
he
being
the
king
of
the
band
,
therefore
he
commanded
his
people
that
they
should
take
their
flight
into
the
northernmost
part
of
the
land
;
and'there
build
up
unto
themselves
a
kingdom
,
until
they
were
joined
by
dissenters
,
(
for
he
flattered
them
that
there
would
be
many
dissenters
,)
and'
they'
become
sufficiently
strong
to
contend
with
the
tribes
of
the
people
.
And
they
did'so
;
and
so
speedy
was
theit
march
,
that
it
could
not
.
be
impeded
,
until
they
had
gone
forth
out
of
the
reach
of
the
people
.
And
thas
ended
the
thirtieth
year
:
and
thus
were
the
affairs
of
the
people
of
Nephi
.
a
!
And
it
came
to
pass
in
the
thirty
and
first
-
year
,
that
they
were
divided
into'tribes
;
every
man
according
to
his
family
,
kindred
:
and
friends
;
nevertheless
tliey
had
come
to
an
agreement
that'they
would

not
go
to
wat
one
with
anothers'
but
they
were
not
united
ato

laws
,
and

;
for
they
were
established
according

therefore

being

for

the

,
went
forth
among

to

he

Anp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
according
to
our
record
,
and
we
know
our
record
to
be
true
,
for
behold
,
it
was
a
just
mnan'who
did
keep
the
record
;
for
he
truly
did
many
miracles
in
the
name
of
Jesus
;
and
there
was
not
any
man
who
could
do
a
miracle
in
the
name
of
Jesus
,
save
he
were
cleansed
every
whit
from
his
iniquity
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
,
if
there
was
no
mistake
made
by
this
man
in
the
reckoning
of
our
time
,
the
thirty
and
third
year
had
passed
away
,
and
the
people
began
to
look
with
great
earnestness
for
the
sign
which
had
been
given
by
the
prophet
Samuel
,
the
Lamanite
;
yea
,
for
the
time
that
there
should
be
darkness
for
the
space
of
three
days
,
over

face
of

And
there
began
to
be
great
doubtings
and
disputations
among
the
people
,
notwithstanding
so
many
signs
had
been
given
.

it

more

righteous

it

they

were

Anp
now
it
came
to'
pass
that
there
were
-
a
great
multitude
gathered
together
;
of
the
people
of
Nephi
,
round
about
the
temple
which'
was
in
the'land
Boun
tiful
;
and
they
were
marveling
and
wondering
one
with
another
,
and
were
shewing
one
to'another
the
great
and
marvelous
change
which
had
taken
place
;
and
they
were
also
conversing
about
this
Jesus
Christ
,
of
whom
the
sign
had
been
given
,
concerning
his
death
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
while
they
were
thus
eon
:
versing
one
with
another
,
'
they
heard
a
voiee
,
'as
if
it
came
out
of
heaven
;
and
they
cast
their
eyes
round
about
,
for
they
uriderstood
not
the
voice
whieh
they
heard
;
and
it
was'not
a
hatsh
voice
,
neither
was
ita
loud
voice
;
nevertheless
;
and
notwithstanding
it'being
a
small
Voice
,
it
did
pierce
them
that
did
bear
,
to
the
centre
;
insomuch'that
there
wereno
part
of
their
frame
that
it'did
not'
cause
to'quake
;
yea
,
it'
did
pierce
them
to'the
very
soul
;
and
did
cause
their
hearts
toburn
.
And
it'tame
to
pass
that
again
they
heard
the
voice
,
and
they
understood
itnot

and
again
the

whenee'the

And
:
it
came
.
to
pass
.
as
they
understood
,
they
cast
their
-
eyes
up
again
towards
heaven
;
and
behold
,
they
saw
mana
descending
out
of
heaven
;
and
he
was
clothedin
.
a
white
robe
,
and
:
he
came
down
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
them
,
and
the
eyes
of
the
whole
multitude
were
turned
upon
him
,
and
.
they
-
durst
not
open
:
their
mouths
,.
even
.
one
to
.
another
,
and
wist
not
what
it
meant
;
for
they
thought
it
was
an
angel
that
had
ap~
unto
them
,
,
And
it
.
came
to
pass
,
that
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
,
and
spake
unto
the
people
,
saying
;
behold
I
am
Jesus
Christ
,
of
whom
the
prophets
testified

come
into

the
world
;
and
behold
I
.
am
the
light
and
the
life
of
the

,,
and
I
have
drunk
out
of
that
bitter
cup
which
the
:
Father
hath
given
me
,
and
have
glorified
the
Father
in
:
taking
upon
me
the
sins
of
the
world
,
in
the
which
I
have
suffered
the
will
of
the
Father
in
all
ings
,
from
the
beginning
.
And
it
.
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
spoken
these
.
words
,
the
whole
multitude
fell
to
the
earth
,
for
they
remembered
that
it
had
been
prophesied
among
them
that
Christ
should
shew
himself
unto
.
them
,
after
his
ascension
into
heaven
...
s

And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
spake
unto
them
saying
,
arise
and
come
forth
unto
me
,
that
ye
may
thrust
your
hands
into
my
side
,
and
also
that
ye
may
feel
the
prints

of
the
nails
in
my
hands
,

in

;
that
ye
may
know
that

Andit
came
to

that
the
multitude
went
forth
,
and
thrust
their
hands
into
his

side
,
and
did
feel

the
prints

of

the
nails
in

hands

in

;
and
they
did
do

going

until
they

for
he

therefore
those
things
which

are
all
fulfilled

Old
things
are
done
away

all
things
have
become
new
;
therefore
I
would
that
ye
shouldbe
perfect
even
as
I
,
or
your
Father
who
is
in
heaven
is
perfect
...
Verily
,
verily
,
1
say
that
I
would
that
ye
should
do
alms
unto
the
poor
;
but
take
heed
that
ye
do
not
youralms
before
men
,
to
beseen
of
them
;
otherwise
ye
have
no
reward
of
your
Father
who
is

.
Therefore
,
when

ye
shall
.
do
your
alms
,
do
not
sound
a
trumpet
before
you
,
as
will
ypocrites
do
in
the
synagogues
,
and
in
the
streets
,
that
they
may
have
glory
of
men
.
Verily
,
I
say
unto
you
,
they
have
their
reward
.
But
.
when
thou
doest
alms
,
let
not
thy
left
hand
know
what
thy
right
hand
doeth
;
that
thine
alms
may
be
in
secret
;
and
thy
Father
who
seeth
in
secret
,
himself
shall
reward
thee
openly
.
And
when
thou
prayest
,
thou
shalt
not
do
as
the
hypocrites
,
for
they
love
to
pray
standing'
in
the
synagogues
,
and
in
-
the'corners

CHAPTER
VI
.
Asp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
spoken
these
words
,
he
looked
upon
the
twelve
whom
he
had
.
chosen
,
and
said
unto
.
them
,
remember
the
words
which{
have
spoken
.
For
behold
,
ye
are
they
whom
I
have
chosen
to
minister
unto
this
people
.
Therefore
:
sy
unto
you
,
take
no
thought
for
your
life
,
what
ye
shall
eat
,
or
what
ye
shall
drink
;
nor
yet
for
your
body
,
what
ye
shall
put
on
.
Is
not
the
life
more
than
meat
,
'and
:
the
-
body
than
rainment
?
Behold
the
fowls
ofthe
air
,
for
they
sow
not
,
neither
do
they
reap
,
nor
gather
into
barns
;
yet
your
heavenly
Father
:
feedeth
them
.
Are
ye
not
much
better
than
they
?
Which
of
you
by
taking
thought
can
add
one
eubit
unto
:
his
stature
?:.
And
why
take
ye
thought
for
rainment
?
Consider
the
lilies
of
the
field
:
how
they
grow
;
they
toll
not
;
neither
do
they
spin
;
and
yet
I
say
unto
you
,
that
:
even
Solomon
,
in
:
all
his
glory
,
was
not
atrayed
like
:
one'
of
thes

Wherefore

,
ewhich
:
to-day
is
,
and
to
[File:508]
eastiinto
the
oven
,
even
so
will
he
clothe
you
,
if
ye
are
not
of
little
faith
.
Therefore
take
no
thought
,
saying
,
What'shall
we
eat
?
or
,
what
shall
we
drink
?
or
,
wherewithal
hall
we
be
clothed
?)
For
your
heavenly
Father
knoweth
that
ye
have
need
of
all
these
things
.
But
seek
ye'
first
the
kingdom
of
God
,
and
his
righteousness
,
and
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
you
Take
therefore
no
thought
for
the
morrow
,
for
the
morrow
shall
take
thought
for
the
things'
of
itself
.
Sufficient
is
the
day
unto
the
evil
thereof
.
And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
spoken
these
words
,
he
turned
again
to
the
multitude
,
and
did
open
his
:
mouth
unto
.
them
again
,
saying
,
verily
,
verily
,
I
say
unto
you
,
judge
not
,
that
:
ye
be
-
not
judged
.
For
with
what
judgment'
ye
judge
,
ye'shall
be
judged
;
and
with
what
measure
ye
mete
,
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again
.
And
why
beholdest
thou
the
mote
thatis
in'
thy
brother's
eye
,
but
considerest
not
the
beam
that
is
in
thine
own
eye
?
Or
how'wilt
thou
say
to'thy
brother
,
let
me
pull
the
mote
out
of
thine
eye
;
and
behold
,
a
beam
is
in
thine'own'
eye
?
Thou
hypocrite
,
first
cast
the
beam
out
of
thine
own
eye
:
and
then
shalt
thou
see
clearly
to
cast
the
mote
out
of
thy
brother'seye
.
Give
not
that
which
is
holy
unto
the
dogs
,
neither
cast
ye
your
pearls
before

,
lest
they

their
feet
,
and

CHAPTER
VII
.
Axp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
ended
these
sayings
,
he
cast
:
his
eyss
round
about
on
the
multitude
,
'
and
said
-
unto
theni
,
behold
,
ye
have
heard
the
things
which
Ihave
taught
before
I
ascended
to
my
Father
;
therefore
.
whoso
remembereth
these'
say4ngs
-
of
mine
,
and
doeth
them
,
him
will
I
raise
up
at
the
last
day
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
said
these
words
,
he
perceived
that
there
were
s0me
among
them
who
:
marveled
,
and
wondered
what
he
would
concerning
:
the
law
of
Moses
;
for
they
understood
not
the
sa
ing
,
that
old
:
things'
had
passed
away
,.
and
that
all
things
had
become
new
.
And
he
said
unto
them
,
marvel
not
that
I
said
:
unto
you
,:
that
old
:
things
had
-
passed
away
;
and
thateall
things
had
[File:510]
become
new
.
.
Bohold
:
I
say
unto
you
,
that
.
the
law
is
fulfilled
that
was
given
unto
Moses
,
Behold
,
Â¥
am
-
he
that
gave
the
law
,
andI
am
he
who
covenanted
with
my
people
Israel
:
therefore
,
the
law
in
me
is
fulfilled
,
for
I
have
come
to
fulfil
the
law
;
therefore
,
it
hath
an
end
.
Behold
,
I
do
not
destroy
the
prophets
,
for
as
many
as
have
not
been
fulfilled
in
me
,
verily
,
Tsay
unto
you
,
shall
all
be
fulfilled
.
And
because
I
gaid
unto
you
,
that
.
old
things
hath
passed
away
,
I
do
not
destroy
that
which
hath
been
spoken
concerning
things
which
are
tocome
.
For
behold
,
the
covenant
which
I
have
made
with
my
people
,
is
not
all
fulfilled
;
but
the
law
which
was
given
unto
Moses
,
hath
an
end
in
me
.
Behold
,
I
am
.
the
law
,
and
the
i
look
unto
me
,
and
endure
to
the
end
,
and
ye
shall
live
,
for
unto
him
that
endureth
to
.
the
end
,
will
I
give
eternal
life
.
Behold
,
I
have
given
unto
you
the
commandments
;
therefore
keep
my
commandments
,
And
this
is
the
law
and
the
prophets
,
for
they
traly
testified
of
me
.
And
now
it
.
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
spokenthese
words
,
he
said
unto
those
twelve
whom
he
had
chosen
,
\ye
.
are
,
my
disciples
;
and
.
ye
are'a
light
unto
:
this
people
,
who
area
remnant
off
the
house
of
Joseph
.
And
behold
,
this
is
the
land
of
your
inheritance
;
and
the
Father
hath
given'
it
unto
you
,
And
not
at
any
time
hath
the
Father
given
me
commanement
that
I
should
tell
it
unto
your
brethren
at
Jerurusalem
;
neither
at'
any
time
hath
the
Father
given
me
commandment
,
that
I
:
should
tell
unto
them
concerning
the
other
tribes
of
the
house
of
Israel
,
whom
the
Father
hath
led
away
out
of
the
land
,
This
mach

the
Father
command

me

that
I
should

unto
them
,
that
other

I

which
are

now

therefore'l
was

to
say
:
no

more
of

Father
concerning

thing
unto

But
,
verily
,
I
say
unto
you

that

hath
commanded
me

I
tell

it
unto
you
,
that

ye

therefore
it
is
because
of

,
,
that
they

you
.
And
verily
,
I
say

unto

;
that
the
other

I

I

must
bring
,
and
they
.
shall
hear
my
voice
;
and
there
shall
be
one
fold
,
and
one
shepherd
.
And
they
understood
me
not
,
for
they
supposed
it
had
been
the
Gentiles
;
for
they
understood
not
that
the
Gentiles
should
be

verted
through
their
preaching
;
and
they
understood'
me
not

and
they
understood

me
not
that
the

Gentiles
should
not
at
any
time
hear
my
voice
;
that
I
should
not
manifest
myselfunto
them
,
save
it
were
by
the
Holy

But
behold
,
ye
have
both
heard
my

and
seen
me
;
and
ye
are

and
ye

And

neither

I

with

one
accord
;
'did
go'forth
,
with
[File:514]
their

;
and
their

,
and
their
lame
,
and
with
their

,
and
with
their
dumb
,
and
with
all
they
that
were
afflicted
in
any
manner
;
and
:
he
did
heal
them
every
one
as
they
were
brought
forth
unto
him
;
and
they
did
-
all
,
both
they
who
had
been
healed
,
and'
they
who
were
wholes
bow
!
down
at
his
feet
,
and
did
worship
him
;
and
as'
many
as
could
come
forthe
multitude
did
kiss
his
feet
,
insomuch
that
they
did
bathe
his
feet
with
their
tears
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
commanded
that
their
little
children
should
be
brought
.
So
they
brought
their
little
children
and
sat
them
down
upon
hs
ground
round
about
him
,
and
Jesus
stood
in
the
midst
;
and
the
multitude
gave
way
tillthey
had
all
been
brought
unto
him
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
all
-
been
:
brought
,
and
Jesus
stood
in
the
midst
,
he
commanded
the
multitude
that
they
should
kneel
down
upon
the
ground
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had'knelt
upon
the
ground
,
Jesus
groaned
within
himeelf
,
and
eaith
,
Father
,
I
am
troubled
because
of
the
wickedness
of
the
people
of
the
house
of
Israel
,
And
when
he
had
said
these
words
,
he
himself
also
knelt
upon
the
earth
;
and
behold
he
prayed
unto
the
Father
,
and
the
things
which
he
prayed
,
cannot
be
written
,
and
the
multitude
did
bear
record
who
heard
him
.
-
And
after
this
manner
do
they
bear
record
:
the
eye
hath
never
seen
,
neither
hath
the
ear
heard
,
before
,
so
great
and
marvelous
thirigs
as
we
saw
and
sheard
Jesus
speak
unto
the
Father
;
andno
tongue
can
speak
,
neither
can'
there
be
written
by
any
man
,
neither
can
the
hearts
of
men
conceive
so
great
and
marvelous
things
as
we
both
saw
and
heard
Jesus
speak
;
and
no
one
can
conceive
of
the
joy
which
filled
our
souls
at
the
time
we
heard
him
pray
for
0s
unto
the
Father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
made
an
end
cprayinig
unto
the
Father
,
he
arose
;
but
so
great
was
the
joy
of
the
multitude
,
that
they
were
overcome
.
And
it
came'to
pass
:
that
Jesus
spake
unto
them
,
and
bade
them
arise
.
And
they
arose
from
the
earth
,
and
he
said
:
unto
them
,
blessed
are
as
because
of
your
faith
.
And
now
behold
,
my
joy
is
full
.
'
And'when'
he
had
saidthese
words
,
he
wept
,
andthe'
multitude
bear
reeord
of
it
,
and
he
took
their
little
children
,
one
by
one
and
blessed
them
,
and
prayed
unto
the
Father
for
them
:
And'
when

and
he
spake

;
behold'

your
little
ones
.
And
as
they
looked
:
to
behold
;
they
cast
their
eyes
towards
heaven
;
and
they
.
saw
the
heavens
open
,
and
they
saw
angels
descending
out
:
of
heaven
as
it
were
,
in
the
midst
of
fire
;
-
and
they
came
down
and
encircled
those
little
ones
about
;
and
they
were
encircled
about
with
fire
;
and
the
angels
did
minister
unto
them
,
andthe
multitude
did
see
and
hear
;
and'
bear
record
;
and
they
know
that
their
record
is
trae
,
for
they
all
of

did

every

for
himself
;
and
they
were
in
number
about
two
thousaidand
five
hundred
souls
;
and
they
did
consiat
of
men
,
women
and
children
.
:
And
:
it
came
to
pass
that
Jesus
commanded
his
disciples
that
-
they
should
bring
forth
some
bread
and
wine
unto
him
.
And
while
they
were
gone
for
bread
and
wine
,
he
commanded
the
multitude
that
they
should
sit
themselves
down
upon
the
earth
...
And
when
the
disciples
had
come
with
bread
and
wine
,
he
took
of
the
bread
;
and
brake
and
.
blessed
it
;
and
he
gave
unto
the
disciples
,
and
commanded
that
should
eat
.
And
when
they
had
eat
,
and
were
fill
he'commanded
that
they
should
give
unto
the
multitude
.
And
when
the
multitude
had
eaten
and
were
filled
;
he
said
unto
the
disciples
,
behold
,
there
shall
one
be
ordained
ameng
you
,.
and
to
him
will
.
I
give
power
that
he
shall
break
bread
,
and
bless
it
,
and
give
itunto
:
the
people
of
my
church
,
unto
all
those
who
shall
believe
and
be
baptized
in
my
name
.
And
this
shat
ye
always
observe
to
do
,
even
as
I
have
done
,
even
as
I
have
broken
bread
,
and
blessed
it
,
and
gave
itunto
you
.
And
this
shall
ye
do
in
remembrance
of
my
body
,
which
l
have
skewn
unto
you
,
And
_it
shall
be
a
testimony
unto
the
Father
,
that
ye
do
always
remember
me
.
And
if
ye
do
always
remember
me
,
ye
shall
have
my
spirit
to
be
with
you
.
And
itcame
to
pass
that
when
he
had
said
these
Words
,
he
:
commanded
his
diseiples
that
they
should
take'of
the
wine
of
the
cup
,
and
drink
of
it
,
and
that
they
stiould
also
give

the
multitude

that
they
might

And
it
came
to

and
were

and
they
gave

and
they
were

And
when

And
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
spoken
these
words
,
he
turned
his
eyes
again
upon
the
disciples
whom
he
had
:
chosen
,
and
said
unto
them
;
behold

this
is
the
commandment
which
I
give
unto

,
that
ye

not

knowingly

to

of

when

ye

then
shall
ye
receive
him
,
and
shall
minister
unto
him
of
my
flesh

;
bat
ifhe

,
he'shall

for
ye
know
not

what
they
will
retum
and
repent
,
and
ome
unto
me
with
full
purpose
of
heart
,
and
I
shall
heal
them
,
and
ye
shall
be
the
means
of
bringing
salvation
unto
them
.
Therefore
keep
these
sayings
which
I
have
commanded
you
,
that'
ye
come
not
under
condemnation
,
for
wo
unto
him
whom
the
Father
condemneth

And
{
give
you
these
commandments
,

of
the
disputations

which
have
been
among
you

And
blessed
are
ye
if
ye

Ro
disputations

now
I

I

And
it
came

that
when

Jesus
had
made
an

these
sayings
,

came
a
cloud

overshadowed

were

he
departed
from

Axp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
aseended
into

,
the
multitude
did
disperse
,
and
every
man
did
take
his
wife
and
is
children
,
and
did
return
to
his
own
home
.
And
it
was
noised
abroad
among
the
people
immediately
,
before
it
was
yet
.
dark
,
that
the
multitude
had
seen
Jesus
,
and
.
that
he
had
ministered
unto
them
,
and
that
he
would
also
show
himself
on
the
morrow
unto
the
multitude

,
and
even
all

it
was
noised
abroad

did
they

send
forth
unto
the
people
,
that
.
there
were
:
many
,
yea
,
an
exceeding
great
number
did
labor
exceedingly
all
that
night
,
that
they
might
be
on
the
morrow
in
the
place
where
Jesus
should
shew
himself
unto
the
multitude
,
wAnd
-
it
came
:
to
pass
that
on
the
morrow
,
wher
the
multitude
was
gathered
.
together
,
behold
Nephi
and
his
brother
whom
hevhad
.
raised
from
the
dead
,
whose
mame

was
Timothy
,
and
glso
his

,
whose
name
was

and
Jeremiah

Shemnon

and

;

and
Zedekiah
,
and
Isaiah
;
now
these
were
the
names
of
the
disciples
whom
Jesus
had
.
chosen
.
.
And
;
it
came
-
to
pass
that
they
went
forth
,
and
stood
in
the
:
midst
of
the
multitude
...
And
behold
,
the
multitude
was
so
great
,
that
.
they
did
caus
?
that
.
they
.
should
be
:.
separated
:
into
twelve
bodies
..
And
ithe
twelve
did
teach
the
multitude
;
and
behold
,
they
did
cause
that
the
multitude
should
kneel
down
upon
the
face
of
the
-
earth
,
and
should
pray
unto
the
Wather
,
in
the
name
of
Jesus
,
..
And
the
disciples
did
pray
-
unto
the
Father
also
,
in
,
the
name
.
of
Jesus
.:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
.
arose
and
.
ministered
unto
[File:519]
the
people
.
And
when
they
had
ministered
those
same
words
which
Jesus
had
spoken
.
nothing
varying
from
the
words
which
Jesus
had
spoken
.
behold
,
they
knelt
again
,
and
prayed
to
the
Father
in
the
name
of
Jesus
;
and
they
did
pray
for
that
which
they
most
desired
;
and
they
desired
that
the
Holy
Ghost
should
be
given
into
them
.
And
when
they
had
thus
prayed
,
they
went
down
unto
the
water's
edge
,
and
the
multitude
followed
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
went
down
into
the
water
,
and
was
baptized
.
.
And
he
came
up
out
of
the
water
and
began
to
baptise
.
And
he
baptized
all
those
whom
Jesus
had
chosen
.
And
it
came
to
pass
when
they
were
all
baptized
,
and
had
come
up
out
of
the
water
,
the
Holy
Ghost
did
fall
upon
them
,
and
they
were
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost
,
and
with
fire
.
And
behold
,
they
were
encirled
about
as
if
it
were
fire
;
and
it
came
down
from
heaven
,
and
the
multitude
did
witness
it
,
and
do
bear
record
;
and
angels
did
come
down
out
of
heaven
,
and
did
minister
unfo
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
while
the
angels
were
ministering
unto
the
disciples
,
behold
,
Jesus
came
and
stood
in
the
midst
,
and
ministered
unto
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
spake
unto
the
multitude
,
and
commanded
them
that
they
should
kneel
down
again
upon
the
earth
,
and
alse
that
his
disciples
should
kneel
down
upon
the
earth
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
all
knelt
down
upon
the
earth
,
he
commanded
his
disciples
that
they
should
pray
.
And
behold
,
they
began
to
pray
;
and
they
did
pray
unto
Jesus
,
calling
him
their
Lord
and
their
God
.
a
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Jesus
departed
out
of
the
midst
of
them
,
and
went
a
little
way
off
from
them
and
bowed
himself
to
the
earth
,
and
he
said
,
Father
,
Ithank
thee
that
thou
hast
given
the

Ghost
unto
these
whom
I

;
and
it

their
belief'in

,
that
I
have
chosen
them
out

Father
,
I
:
pray
thee
that

wilt
give

unto
all

,
because
thou
hearest
them

and
:
they
pray
unto
me
;
and
they
pray
unto
me
because
I
am
with
them
.
And
now

pray
unto
thee

And
it
came
to
pass
,
that
when
Jesus
had
thus
prayed
unto
the
Father
,
he
came
unto
his
disciples
,
and
behold
,
:
they
did
still
continue
,
without
ceasing
,
to
pray
unto
him
;
and
they
did
not
multiply
.
many
words
,
for
it
was
given
unto
them
what
they
should
pray
,
and
they'
were
filled
with
desire
..
And
it
caine
to
pass
that
Jesus
blessed
them
,
as
-
they
did
pray
unto
him
,
and
-
his
countenance
did
smile
upon
.
them
,
and
.
the
light
of
his
countenance
did
shine
upon
them
,
and
behold
they
were
as
white
as
the
countenance
,
and
also
the
garments
of
Jesus
;
and
behold
the
whiteness
thereof
did
exceed
all
the
whiteness
,
yea
,
even
there
could
be
nothing
upon
earth
so
white
as
the
whiteness
there
of
.
--
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
,
pray
on
,
nevertheless
they
did
not
cease
to
pray
.
..
And
he
turned
from
then
again
,
and
went
a
little
way
off
;
and
bowed
himself
to
the
earth
;
and
he
prayed
again
unto
the
Father
,
saying
,
Father
,
I
thank
thee
that
thou
hdst
purified
those
whom
I
chave
chosen
,
because
of
their
faith
,
andI
pray
for
them
,
and
also
for
them
who
shall
believe
on
their
words
,
that
they
may
be
purified
in
me
,
through
faith
on
their
words
,
even
as
they
are
purified
in
me
.
Father
,
I
pray
not
for
the
world
,
but
for
those
whom
thou
hast
given
me
out
of
the
world
,
because
of
their
faith
,
that
they
may
be
purified
in
me
,
that
I
may
be
in

them
as
thou
,
Father
,
art
in
me
,
that
we
may
be
one
,
that
I
may
be
glorified
in
them
.
And
when
Jesus
.
had
spoken
these
words
,
he
came
again
unto
his
disciples
,
and
behold
they
did
pray
steadfastly
,
without
.
ceasing
,
unto
him
;
and
he
did
smile
upon
them
again
;
and
behold
they
were
white
,
even
as
Jesus
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
went
again
a
little
way
off
,
and
prayed
unto
the
Father
;
and
tongue
cannot
speak
the
words
which
he
prayed
,
neither
can
be
writ
ten
:
by
man
the
words
.
which
he
prayed
.
And
the
multitude
did
hear
,
and
do
bear
record
,
and
.
their
hearts
were
open
,
and
they
did
understand
:
in
their
hearts
the
words
which
he
prayed
.
-
Nevertheless
,.
so
great
and
marvelous
were
the
words
which
he
prayed
,
that
they
cannot

be
written
.
neither
can
they
be
uttered
by
man

;

AWndit
came'to
pase
that
.
when
Jesus
had
made
an
end
.
of
praying
,
he
enme
again
to
the
disciples
,
and
said
unto
them
,
so
great
faith
have
I
never
seen
among
[File:521]
all
the
Jews
;
wherefore
I
could
not
shew
unto
theni
#0
great
miracles
,
because
of
their
unbelief
Verily
I
gay
unto
you
,
there
are
none
of
them
that
have
seen'
so
great
things
as
ye
have
seen
;
neither
have
they
heard
so
great
things
as
ye
have
heard
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
commanded
the
multitude
that
they
should
cease
to
pray
,
and
also
his
disciples
.
And
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
not
cease
to
pray
in
their
hearts
,
And
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
arise
and
stand
up
upon
their
feet
.
And
they
arose
up
and
stocd
upon
their
feet
..
And
it
came
to
pass'
that
he
break
bread
again
,
and
blessed
it
,
and
gave
to
the
disciples
to
eat
.
And
when
they
had
eaten
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
break
bread
,
and
give
unto
the
multitude
.
And
when
they
had
given
unto
the
multitude
,
he
also
gave
them
wine
to
drink
,
and
commanded
them
that
they
should
give
unto
the'multitude
.
Now
there
had
been
no
breed
,
neither
wine
,
brought
by
the
disciples
,
neither
by
the
multitude
;
but
he
truly
gave
unto
them
bread
to
eat
,
and
also
wine
to
drink
;
and
he
said
unto
them
,
he
that
eateth
this
bread
,
eateth
of
my
body
to
his
soul
,
and
he
that
drinketh
of

,
drinketh
of

to
his

,
and
his
soul
shallnever
hunger

shall
be

when
the
multitude
had
all
eaten

behold
they
were
filled
with
the
spirit
,
and
they
did
cry
out
with
one
voice
,
and
gave
gloty
to
Jesus
,
whom
they
both
saw

And
it
came
to

that
when
they
had
all
given
glory
unto
Jesus
,
he
saith
unto'
them
,
behold
now
I
finish
the
commandment
which
the
Father
hath
commanded
me
concerning
this
people
who
are
a
remnant
of
the
house
of
Israel

Ye
remember
that
I
spake
unto
you
,
and
said
that
when
the
words
of
Isa
:
ah
should
be
fulfilled
,
behold
they
are
written
,
ye
have
them
before
you
;
therefore
search
them
.
And
verily
,
verily
I
say
unto
you
,
that
when
they
shall
be
fulfilled
,
then
is
the
ful
Ming
of
the
covenant
which
the
Father
hath
made
unto
his
people
.
O
house
of
Israel
,
and
then
shall
the
remnants
which
shall
be
scattered
abroad
upon
the
faceof
the
earth
,
be
gathered
in
from
the
east
,
and
from
the
west
,
and
from
the
south
,
and
from

north
;
and
they'
shall
be
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
the
Lord
their
God
,
who
hath
redeemed
them

And
the
Father
hath'
commanded
me
that
I
should
give
unto
You
this
land
,
for
your

that
I

Jesus

Then

with

Then

the

gether

Then

when

that
thy

it

unto
the
fulfilling

hath
made
unto

And
when
that

it
shall
come
to

that
kings
shall
shut
their
mouths
;
for
that
which
had
not
been
told
them
shall
they
see
;
and
that
which
they
had
not
heard
shall
they
consider

For
in
that
day
,
for
my
sake
shall
the
Father
work
a
work
,
which
shall
be
a
great
and
a
marvelous
work
among
them
;
and
there
shall
be
among
who
.
will
not
believe
it
,
although
a
man
shall
declare
it
unto
them
.
But
behold
,
the
life
of
my
servant
shall
be
in

iy
hand
;
therefore
they
shall
not
hurt
him
,
although
he
shall
be
marred
because
of
them
.
Yet
I
will
heal
him
,
for
I
will
shew
unto
them
that
my
wisdom

is
greater
than
the
cunning
of

unto
him

he

a
commandment
I
give
unto
you
,
that
ye
search
these
things
diligently
;
for
great
are
the
words
of
isaiah
.
For
surely
ne
spake
as
touching
all
things
concerning
my
people
which
are
of
the
house
of
Jsrael
;,
therefore
it
must
needs
be
that
.
he
must
speak
also
to
the
Gentiles
.
And
all
things
that
he
spake
,
hath
been
,
and
shall
be
,
even
according
to
the
words'
which
he
spake
.
Therefore
give
heed
to
iy
words
,
Write
the
things
which
I
have
told
you
;
and
according
to
the
time
and
the
will
of
the
Father
,.
they
shall
:
go
forth
unto
the
Gentiles
.
And
whosoever
will
hearken
unto
my
words
,
and
repent
eth
,
and
is
baptized
,
the
same
shall
be
saved
.
..
Search
the
prophets
,
for
many
there
be
that
testify
of
these
:
things
.
:
And
.
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
said
these
words
,
he
said
unto
them
again
,
after
he
had
expounded
all
the
scriptures
unto
them
which
they
had
received
,
he
said
unto
them
,
behold
,
other
scriptures
I
would
that
ye
should
write
,
that
ye
have
not
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
onto
Nephi
,
bring
forth
the
xecord
which
.
ye
have
kept
.
And
.
when
.
Nephi
had
vrought
forth
the
records
,
and
laid
them
before
him
,
he
cast
his
eyes
upon
them
,
and
said
verily
,
I
-
say
unto
you
,
commanded
my
servant
Samuel
,
the
Lamanite
,
that
he
should
testify
unto
this
people
,
thateat
the
day
that
the'Father
should
glorify
his
name
in
me
,
that
there
were
.
manyisaints
who
should
arise
from
:
the
dead
,
and
should
appear
unto
many
,
and
should
minister
unto
them
.
And
he
said
unto
them
,
were
it
not
so
?
And
.
his'
disciples
answered
him
-
and
said
;
yea
;
Lord
,
Samuel
did
prophesy
according
to
thy
words
,
and
they
were
all
fulfilled
...
And
Jesus
said
unto
them
,
how
be
it
that
ye
have
not
written
this
thing
,
that
many
saints
did
arise
and
appear
unto
many
,
and
did
iuinister
unto
them
?
.
And
:
it
came
to
pass
that
Nephi
remembered
that
this
thing
shad
not
1
vritten
.
And
it
-
came
to
.
pass
that
Jesus
commanded
that
[File:529]
should
be
written
;
therefore
it
was
written
according
as
he
commanded
.
CHAPTER
XI
.
Asp
now
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
expounded
all
tle
scriptures
in
one
,
which
they
had
written
he
commanded
them
that
they
should
teach
the'things
which
he
had
expounded
unto
them
.
Â©
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
commanded
them
that'they
should
write
the
words
which
the
Father
had
given
unto
Malachi
,
which
he
should
tell
unto
them
.
And
itcame
to
pass
that
after
they
were
written
,
he
expounded
them
.
And
these
are
the
words
which
he
did
tell
unto
them
,
saying
,
thus
said
the
Father
unto
Malachi
,
behold
,
I
will
send
my
messenger
,
and
he
shall
prepare
the
way
before

,
and
the
Lord
,
whom

,
shall
suddenly
come
to
his
temple
,
even
the
messenger
of

he
shall

saith
the
Lord
of
hosts
.
Bat
who
may
abide
the
day
of
his
coming
?
and
who
shall
stand
when
he
appeareth
?
for
he
is
like
a
refiner's
fire
,
and
like
faller's
soap
.
And
he
shall
sit
asa
refiner'and
purifyer
of
silver
:
and
he
shall
purify
the
sons
of
Levi
,
and
purge
them
as
gold
and
silver
,
that
they
may
offer
unto
the
Lord
an
offering
in
righteousness
.
Then
shall
the
offering
of
Judah
and
Jerusalem
be'pleasant
unto
the
Lord
,
as
in
the
days
of
old
,
and
as

And
I
will
come
near
to
you
to

I
will
be
a
swift
witness
against
the
sorcerers

against

And
I

he

saith
the
Lord

Your

have
been
stout
against
me
,
saith
the
Lord
.
Yet
ye
say
;
what
have
we
spoken
against
thee
?
Ye
have
said
,
it
is'vain
to
:
serve
God
,
and
what
doth
it
profit
that
we
have
kept
his
ordinance
,
and
that
we

yea
,
they

yea
,
them
that
tempt
God
are
even

Then
they
that
feared
the
Lord
spake
often
one
to
another
,
and
the
Lord
hearkened
,
and
heord
;
anda
book
of
remembrance
was
written
before
him
for
them
that
feared
the

,
and
that

they

Then

And
now
it
came

he
did
expound

saith
,
these

ye

commanded
that

for
it
was
wisdom

him
that

And
he
did
expound
all
things
,
even
from
the

Axb
now
there
cannot
be

even
shundredth
part
of
the
things
which
Jesus
did
truly
teach
unto
the
people
;
but
behold
the
plates
of
Nephi
do
contain
the
more
part
of
the
things
which
he
taught
the
people
;
@hd
these
things
have
I
written
,
which
are
a
lesser
part
of
the
things
which
he
taught
the
people
;
and
I
have
written
them
to
the
intent
that
they
maybe
brought
again
unto
this
people
,
from
the
Gentiles

according
to
the
words

Jesus
hath
spoken

And
when

have
received

is

that
the
should

first
,
to

if
it
shallso
be
that
they
shall
believe
these
things
,
then
shall
the
greater
things
be
made
manifest
unto
them

And
if

Behold
I
were
about

Write
them
all
which
were
engraven
upon
the
plates
but
the
Lord
forbid
it
,
saying
,
I
will
try
the
[File:532]
faith
of
my
people
;
therefore
I
,
Mormon
,
do
write
the
things
which
have
been
commanded
me
of
the
Lord
,
And
now
I
,
Mormon
,
make
an
end
of
my
sayings
,
and
proceed
to
write
the
things
which
have
been
command
.
ed
me
;
therefore
I
would
that
ye
should
behold
that
the
Lord
truly
did
teach
the
people
,
for
the
space
of
three
days
;
and
after
that
,
he
did
shew
himself
unto
them
oft
,
and
did
break
bread
oft
,
and
bless
it
,
and
give
it
.
unto
them
.
;
.
And
it
came
to
-
pass
that
he
did
teach
and
minister
unto
the
children
of
the
multitude
of
whom
hath
been
spoken
,
and
he
did
loose
their
tongues
,
and
they
did
speak
unto
their
fathers
great
and
marvelous
things
,
even
grater
than
he
had
revealed
unto
the
people
,
and
loosed
their
tongues
.
that
they
could
utter
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
.
after
he
had
ascended
into
heaven
the
second
time
that
he
shewed
himself
unto
them
,
and
had
gone
unto
the
Father
,
after
.
having
healed
all
their
sick
,
and
their
lame
,
and
opened
the
eyes
of
their
blind
,
and
unstopped
the
ears
of
the
deaf
,
and
even
had
done
all
manner
of
cures
among
them
,
:
and
raised
aman
from
the
dead
,
and
had
shewn
forth
his
power
unto
them
,
and
had
ascended
unto
the
Father
,
behold
,
it
came
to
pass
on
the
morrow
,
that
the
multitude
thered
themselves
together
,
and
they
both
saw
and
_
heard
these
children
;
yea
,
even
babes
did
-
open
theit
mouths
,
and
utter
marvelous
things
;
and
the
things
which
they
did
utter
were
forbidden
,
that
there
should
not
any
man
write
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
disciples
whom
Jesus
had
chosen
,
began
from
that
time
forth
to
baptize
and
to
teach
as
many
as
did
come
unto
them
;
and
as
many
as
were
baptized
in
the
name
.
of
Jesus
,
were
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost
...
And
many
of
them
saw
and
heard
unspeakable
things
,
which
are
not
lawful
to
be
written
;
and
they
taught
,
and
did
ninister
one
to
another
;
and
they
had
all
things
common
among
them
,
every
man
dealing
justly
,
one
with
another
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
do
.
all
things
,
even
as
.
Jesus
had
commanded
.
them
.
.
And
they
who
were
baptized
in
the
name
of
Jesus
,
were
called
the
church
of
Christ
...
;
et
a
.
And
.
it
came
ito
pass
that
as
the
disciples
of
Jesus
were
:
jourkeying
and
.
were
preaching
the
things
which
they
had
both
heard
.
and
seen
,.
and
were
baptizing
Jn
the
name
of
Jesus
,
it
came

,
pass
that
.
the
:
disciples
Were
gathered
,
together
;
and
were
united
in
mien
prayer
and
fasting
.
And'
Jesus
!
again
shewed
himee
;
eee
SS
[File:533]
unto
them
,
for
they
were
praying
unto
the
Father
,
in
his
name
;
and
Jesus
came
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
them
,
and
saith
unto
them
,
what
will
ye
that
I
shall
give
unto
you
;
and
they
said
unto
him
,
Lord
,
we
will
that
thou
wouldst
tell
us
the
name
whereby
we
shall
call
this
church
;
for
there
are
disputations
amon
the
people
concerning
this
matter
.
And
the
Lo
said
unto
them
,
verily
,
verily
I
say
unto
you
,
why
is
it
that
the
people
should
murmur
and
dispute
because
of
this
thing
?
have
they
not
read
the
scriptures
,
which
say
ye
must
take
upon
you
the
name
of
Christ
,
which
is
my
mame
?
for
by
this
name
shall
ye
be
called
at'the
last
day
;
and
whoso
taketh
upon
him
my
name
,
and
endureth
to
the
end
,
the
same
shall
be
saved
at
the
last
day
;
therefore
,
whatsoever
ye
shall
do
,
ye
shall
do
it
in
my
name
;
therefore
ye
shall
call
the
church
in
my
name
;
and
ye
shall
call
upon
the
Father
.
in
my
name
,
that
he
will
bless
the
church
for
my
sake
;
and
how
be
it
my
church
,
save
it
be
called
in
my
name
for
if
a
church
be
called
in
Moses'
name
,
then
it
be
Moses'
church
:
or
if
it
be
called
in
the
name
of
a
man
,
thenit
be
the
church
of
a
man
;
but
if
it
be
called
in
my
name
,
then
it
is
my
church
,
if
it
so
be
that
they
are
built
upon
my
gospel
.
Verily
I
say
unto
you
,
that
ye
are
built
upon
my
gospel
;
therefore
ye
shall
eall
whatsoever
things
ye
do
call
in
my
name
;
theretore
if
ye
eall
upon
the
Father
,
for
the
church
,
if
it
be
in
my
name
,
the
Father
will
hear
you
;
and
if
it
so
be
that
the
church'is
built
upon
my
gospel
,
then
will
the
Father
shew
forth
his
own
works
in
it
;
but
if
it
be
not
built
upon
my
gospel
,
and
is
built
upon
the
works
of
men
,
or
upon
the
works
of
the
devil
,
verily
I
say
unto
you
,
they
have
joy
in
their
works
for
a
season
,
and
by
and
by
the
end
cometh
,
and
they
are
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
,
from
whence
there
is
no
return
;
for
their
works
do
follow
them
,
for
it
is
because
of'
their
works
that
they
are
hewn
down
;
therefore
remember
the
things
:
that
I
have
told
you
.
Behold
I
have
given
unto
you
my
gospel
,
and
this
is
the
pel
which
I
have
given
unto
you
,
that
I
came
into
the
world
to
do
the
will
of
:
my
Father
,
because
my
Father
sent
mej
and
my
Father'sent
me
that
I
might
be
lifted
up
upon
the
cross
;
and
:
after
that
}
had
been
lifted
up
upon
the
eross
;
I
mightdraw
all
men
unto
me
;
that
as
I
have
been
lifted
up
by
-
men
;
eyen
so
should
men
be
lifted
u
by
the
Father
,
to'stand
before
me
,
to
be
judged
ot
the
Works
,
whether
they
be
good
or
whether
they
be
evil
;
[File:534]
and
for
this
cause
have
I
been
lifted
up
;:
therefore
,
ac
.
cording
to
the
,
power
of
the
Father
,
I
will
draw
all
men
anto
me
,
that
they
may
be
judged
according
to
their
works
.
And
it
shall
come
to
pass
,
that
whoso
repenteth
and
is
baptized
in
my
name
,
shall
be
filled
;
and
if
he
endureth
to
the
end
,
behold
,
him
will
I
hold
guilt
.
less
before
my
Father
,
at
that
day
when
I
shall
stand
to
judge
the
world
.
And
he
that
endureth
not
unto
the
end
,
the
sume
is
he
.
that
.
is
also
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
,
from
whence
they
can
no
more
re
.
turn
,
because
of
the
justice
of
the
Father
;
and
_
this
is
the
word
which
he
hath
given
unto
the
children
of
men
.
And
for
this
cause
he
fulfilleth
the
words
which
he
hath
given
,
and
he
lieth
not
,
but
fulfilleth
all
hig
words
;
and
no
unclean
thing
can
enter
into
his
kingdom
;
therefore
nothing
entereth
into
his
rest
,
save
it
be
those
who
have
washed
their
garments
in
my
blood
,
because
of
their
faith
,
and
the
repentance
of
all
their
sins
,
and
their
faithfulness
unto
the
end
.
Now
this
is
the
commandment
,
repent
,
all
ye
ends
of
the
earth
,
and
come
unto
me
and
be
baptized
in
my
name
,
thet
ye
may
be
sanctified
by
the
reception
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
that
ye
may
stand
spotless
before
me
at
the
last
day
.
yerly
,
verily
I
say
unto
you
,
this
is
my
gospel
;
and
ye
know
the
things
that
ye
must
do
in
my
church
;
for
the
works
which
ye
have
seen
me
do
,
that
shall
ye
also
do
;
for
that
which
ye
have
seen
me
do
,
even
that
shall
ye
do
;
therefore
if
ye
do
these
things
,
blessed
are
ye
,
for
ye
shall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
.
CHAPTER
XII
.
Write
the
things
which
ye
have
seen
and
heard
,
wave
it'be
those
which
are
forbidden
;
write
.
the
works
of
this
people
,
which
shall
be
even
as
hath
been
writ
ten
of
that
which
hath
been
;
for
-
behold
,
out
-
of
the
books
which
have
:
been
written
,
and
which
shall
be
written
,
shall
this
people
be
.
judged
,
for
by
them
shall
their
works
be
known
unto
men
...
And
.
behold
,
-
all
things
are
written
.
by
the
Father
;
therefore
out
of
the
books
which
shall
be
written
,
shall
the
world
be
judgved
.
And
know
ye
that
ye
shall
-
be
judges
.
of
this
peo~
ple
,
according
to
the
judgment
which
I
shall
give
unto
[File:535]
you
,
which
shall
be
just
;
therefore
what
manner
.
of
men
had
ye
ought
to
be
?
Verily
I
say
unto
you
,
even
asfam
.
And
now
I
go
unto
the
Father
.
And
verily
lsay
unto
you
,
whatsoever
things
ye
shall
ask
the
Father
,
in
my
name
,
it
shall
be
given
unto
you
;
there
fore
ask
,
and
ye
shall
receive
;
knock
,
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you
:
for
he
that
asketh
,
receiveth
,
and
unto
him
tbat
knocketh
,
it
shall
be
opened
.
And
now
behold
,
my
joy
is
great
,
even
unto
fulness
,
because
of
you
,
and
also
this
generaticn
;
yea
,
and
even
the
Father
rejoiceth
,
and
also
all
the
holy
angels
,
because
of
ouand
this
generation
:
for
none
ot
them
are
lost
.
hold
,
I
would
that
ye
should
understand
;
for
I
mean
them
who
are
now
alive
,
of
this
generation
;
and
none
of
them
are
lost
;
and
in
them
have
fulness
of
joy
.
But
behold
,
it
sorroweth
me
because
of
the
fourth
generation
from
this
generation
,
for
they
are
led
away
captive
by
him
,
even
as
was
the
son
of
perdition
;
tor
they
will
sell
me
for
silver
,
and
for
gold
,
and
for
that
which
moth
doth
corrupt
,
and
which
thieves
can
break
through
and
steal
.
And
in
that
day
will
[
visit
them
,
even
in
turning
their
works
upon
their
own
heads
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
ended
these
sayings
,
he
saith
unto
his
disciples
,
enter
ye
in
at
the
straight
gate
:
for
straight
is
the
gate
,
and
narrow
ia
the
way
that
leads
to
life
,
and
few
there
be
that
find
it
,
bat
wide
is
the
gate
,
and
bread
the
way
which
leads
to
death
,
and
many
there
be
that
travel
therein
,
until
the
night
cometh
,
wherein
no
man
can
work
.
And
it
came
to
pass
when
Jesus
had
said
these
words
,
he
spake
unto
his
disciples
,
one
by
one
,
saying
unto
them
,
what
is
it
that
ye
desire
of
me
,
after
that
Tam
gone
to
the
Father
!
And
they
all
,
spake
,
save
it
were
three
,
we
desire
that
after
we
have
lived
unto
the
age
of
man
,
that
our
ministry
,
wherein
thou
hast
called
us
,
may
have
an
end
,
that
we
may
speedily
come
unto
thee
,
in
thy
kingdom
.
And
_
he
said
unto
them
,;
blessed
are
ye
,
because
ye
desired
this
thing
of
me
;
therefore
after
that
ye
are
seventy
and
two
years
old
,
ye
shall
come
unto
me
in
my
kingdom
,
and
with
me
ye
shall
find
rest
.
And
when
he
had
spoken
unto
them
,
he
turned
himself
unto
the
three
,
and
said
unto
them
,
what
will
ye
that
I
should
do
unto
.
you
,
when
I
am
gone
.
unto
the
Father
?
And
they
sorrowed
in
their
hearts
,
for
they
durst
.
not
speak
unto
him
.
the
thing
which
they
desired
.
And
he
said
unto
them
,
[File:536]
behold
,
I
,
know
your
thoughts
,
and
ye
have
desired
the
thing
which
John
,
my
beloved
,
who
was
with
me
in
my
ministry
,
before
that
I
was
lifted
up
by
the
Jews
,
desired
of
me
;
therefore
more
blessed
are
ye
,
for
ye
shall
never
taste
of
death
,
but
ye
shall
live
to
behold
all
the
doings
of
the
Father
,
unto
the
children
of
men
,
even
until
all
tbings
shall
be
fulfilled
,
according
to
the
will
of
the
Father
,
when
I
shall
come
in
my
glory
,
with
the
powers
of
heaven
;
and
ye
shall
never
endure
the
pains
of
death
;
but
when
J
shall
come
in
my
glory
,
ye
shall
be
changed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
from
mortality
to
immortality
;
and
then
shall
ye
be
blessed
fh
the
:
kingdom
of
my
Father
.
And
again
,
ye
shall
not
have
pain
while
ye
shall
dwell
in
the
flesh
,
neither
sorrow
,
save
it
be
for
the
sins
of
the
world
;
and
all
this
will
1
do
because
of
the
thing
which
ye
have
desired
of
me
,
for
-
ye
have
desired
that
ye
might
bring
the
souls
of
men
unto
me
,
while
the
world
shall
stand
;
and
for
this
cause
ye
shall
have
fulness
of
joy
;
and
ye
shall
sit
down'
in
the
kingdom
of
my
Father
;
yea
;
your
joy
shall
be
full
,
even
as
the
Father
hath
given
me
fulness
of
joy
;
and
ye
shall
be
even
as
I
am
,
and
I
am
even
as
the
Father
;
and
the
Father
and
I
are
one
;
and
the
Holy
Ghost
beareth
record
of
the
Father
and
me
;
and
the
Father
giveth
the
Holy
Ghost
unto
the
children
of
men
,
because
of
me
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Jesus
had
spoken
these
words
,
he
touched
every
one
of
them
with
his
finger
,
save
it
were
the
three
who
were
to
tarry
,
and
then
he
departed
.
And'
behold
,
the
heavens
were
opened
,
and
they
were
caught
up
into
heaven
,
and
saw
and
heard
unspeakable
things
.
And
it
was
forbidden
them
that
they
should
uttter
;
neither
was
it
given
unto
them
power
that
they
could
utter
the
things
which
they
saw
and
heard
;
and
whether
they
were
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
,
they
could
not
tell
;
for
it
did
seem
unto
them
like
a
transfiguration
of
them
,
that
they
were
changed
from
this
body
of
flesh
,
into
au
immortal
state
,
that
they
could
behold
the
things
of
God
.
But'it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
:
again
minister
upon'
the
face
of
the
earth
;
nevertheless
they
did
not
minister
of
the
things
which'
they
had
heard
and
:
seen
,
because
of
the
commandment
which
was
given
them
-
in
heaven
,
And
now
whether
they
were
mortal
or
immortal
,
from
the
day
of
their
transfiguration
,
I
know
not
;
but
.
this
much
I
know
,
aceording'to

did

go
orth
upon

face
of
the
land
,
and
did
minisfer
-
unto
all
the
people
,
uniting
as
many
to
the
church
es
would
believe
in
their
preaching
;
baptizing
them
;
and
ap
many
as
were
baptized
,
did
receive
the
Holy
Ghost
;
and
they
were
cast
into
prison
by
them
who
did
not
belong
to
the
church
.
And
the
prisons
could
not
held
them
,
for
they
were
rent
in
twain
,
and
they
were
cast
down
into
the
earth
.
But
they
did
sinite
the
earth
with
the
word
of
God
,
insomuch
that
.
by
his
power
they
were
delivered
out
of
the
depths
of
the
earth
;
and
therefore
they
could
not
dig
pits
sufficient
to
hold
them
.
And
thrice
they
were
cast
.
into
a
.
furs
nace
,
and
received
no
harm
.
And
twice
were
they
cast
into
a
den
of
wild
beasts
;
and
behold
they
did
play
with
the
beasts
,
asa
child
with
a
suckling
lamb
,
and
received
no
harm
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
thug
they
did
go
forth
among
all
the
-
people
of
Nephi
,
and
did
preach
the
gospel
of
Christ
unto
all
people
upon
the
face
of
the
land
;
and
they
were
converted
unto
the
Lord
,
and
were
united
unto
the
church
of
Christ
,
and
thus
the
people
of
that
generation
were
blessed
,
according
to
the
word
of
Jesus
.
And
now
I
,
Mormon
,
make
an
end
of
speaking
concerning
these
thingr

fora

..
Behold
,
I
was
about
to
write
thenames
oz
those
who
were'never
to
taste
of
death
;
but
the
Lord
forbade
,
therefore
I
write
them
not
,
for
they
are
hid
from
the
world
.
But
behold
I
have
seen
them
,
and
they
have
ministered
unto
me
;
and
behold
they
will
be
among
the
Gentiles
,
and
the
Gentiles
knoweth
them
not
.
They
will
also
be
among
the
Jews
,
and
the
Jews
shall
know
them
not
.
And
it
-
shallcome
to
pass
,
when
the
Lord
seeth
fit
in
his
wisdom
,
that
they
shall
minister
unto
all
the
scattered
tribes
of
Israel
,
and
unto
all
nations
,
kindreds
,
tongues
and
people
,
and
shall
bring
out
of
them
unto
Jesus
many
souls
,
that
their
desire
may
be
fulfilled
,
and
also
because
of
the
convincing
power
of
God
which
is
in
them
;
and
they
are
as
the
angels
of
God
and
if
they
-
shall
-
pray
unto
the
Father
in
the
name
of
Jewus
they
can
shew
themselves
unto
whatsoever
man

even
among

shall
there

before

And
if
ye
had
all
the
scriptures
which
give
an
account
ofall
the
marvel
[File:538]
ous
works
of
Christ
,
ye'would
,
according'to
the
words
of
Christ
,
know
that
these
,
things
must
surely
come
:
And
wo
be
unto
him
that
:
will
not
hearken
unto
the
words
of
Jesus
,
and
-
also
to
them
whom
he
hath
chosen
and
sent
among

,
for
whoso
receiveth
not
the
words
of

;
and

words
of

ceive
them
at
the
last
day
;
and
it
would
be
better
for
them
if
they
had
not
been
born
.
For
.
do
ye
suppose
that
ye
can
get
rid
of
the
justice
of
an
offended
God
,
who
hath
been
trampled
under
feet
of
men
,
that
there
.
by
salvation
might
come
?
And
row
behold
,
as
I
spake
concerning
those
whom
the
Lord
had
chosen
,
yea
,
even
three
who
were
caught
up
into
the
heavens
,
that
I
knew
not
whether
they
were
cleansed
from
mortality
to
immortality
.
But
behold
,
since
I
wrote
,
I
have
inquired
of
the
Lord
,
and
he
hath
made
it
manifest
unto
me
,
that
there
must
needs
be
a
change
wrought
upon
their
bodies
,
or
else
itneeds
be
that
they
must
taste
ofdeath
;
therefore
that
they
might
not
taste
of
death
,
there
was
a
change
wrought
upon
their
bodies
,
that
they
mght
not
suffer
pain
nor
sorrow
,
save
it
were
for
:
the'sins
of
the
world
,
Now
this
change
was
not
equal
to'that
which
should
take
place
at
the
lost
day
;
but
there
wasa
change
wrought
upon
them
,
insomuch
that
satan
could
have
no
power
over
them
,
that
he
could
not
tempt
them
,
and
they
were
sanctified
in
the
flesh
,
that
they
were
holy
,
and
that
the
powers
of
the
earth
could
not
hold
them
;
and
in
this
state
they
were
to
remain
until
the
judgment
day
of
Christ
;
and
at
that
day
they
were
to
receive
a
greater
change
,
and
to
be
received
into
.
the
.
kingdom
of
the
Father
to
go
no
more
out
;
but
to
-
dwell
with
God
eternally
in
the
heayens
.
And
now
behold
,
I
say
unto
you
,
that
when
the
Lord
shall
see
fit
,
in
his
wisdom
,
that
these
sayings
shall
come
unto
the
Gentiles
,
according
to
his
word
,
then
ye
may
know
that
the
covenant
which
the
Father
hath
made
with
the
children
of
Israel
,
concerning
their
restoration
tothe
lands
of
their
inheritance
,
is
already
beginning
to
be
fulfilled
;
and
ye
may
know
that
the
words
of
the
Lord
,
which
have
been
spoken
by
the
holy
prophets
,
shall
all
be
fulfilled
;
and
ye
need
not
say
that
the
Lord
delays
his
coming
unto
the
children
of
Israel
;
and
ye
need
not
imagine
in
your
hearts
that
the
words
which
have
been
spoken
:
are
vain
,
for
behold
,
the
Lord
willremember
his
:
covenant
which
he
hath
made
unto
his
peopleof
the
house
of
Israel
.
Avd
[File:539]
when
ye
shall
see
these
sayings
coming
forth
among
you
,
then
ye
need
not
any
longer
spurn
at
the
doings
of
the
Lord
,
for
the
sword
of
his
justice
is
in
his
right
hand
,
and
behold
at
that
day
,
if
ye
shall
spurn
at
his
doings
,
he
will
cause
that
it
shall
soon
overtake
you
.
Wo
unto
him
that
spurneth
at
the
doings
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
wo
unto
him
that
shall
aeny
the
Christ
and
his
works
;
yea
,
wo
unto
him
that
shall
deny
the
revelations
of
the
Lord
,
and
that
shall
say
,
the
Lord
no
longer
worketh
by
revelation
,
or
by
prophecy
,
or
by
gifls
,
or
by
tongues
,
or
by
healings
,
or
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;
yea
,
and
wo
unto
him
that
shall
say
at
that
day
,
that
there
can
be
no
miracle
wrought
by
Jesus
Christ
,
to
get
gain
;
for
he
that
doeth
this
,
shall
become
like
unto
the
son
of
perdition
,
for
whom
there
was
no
mercy
,
according
to
the
word
of
Christ
.
Yea
,
and
ye
need
not
any
longer
hiss
,
nor
spurn
,
nor
make
game
of
the
Jews
,
nor
any
of
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
Israel
,
for
behold
the
Lord
remembereth
his
covenant
unto
them
,
and
he
will
do
unto
them
according
to
that
which
he
hath
sworn
;
therefore
ye
need
not
suppose
that
ye
can
turn
the
right
hand
of
the
Lord
unto
the
left
,
that
he
may
not
execute
judgment
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
covenant
which
he
hath
made
unto
the

.
I
.
An
account
of
the
people
of
Nephi
,
according
to
his
record
,
Anp
it
came
to
pass
that
the
thirty
and
:
fourth
year
passed
away
,
and
also
the
,
thirty
and
fifth
,
and
behold
the
disciples
of
Jesus
had
formed
.
a
church
of
Christ
in
all
the
lands
round
about
.
And
as
many
as'did
:
come
unto
them
,
and
did
truly
repent
of
their
sins
,
were
baptized
.
in
the
name
of
Jesus
;
and
they
-
did
alsoreceive
the
Holy
Ghost
.
is
And
it
-
came
to
:
pass
.
in
the
thirty
and
sixth
year
,
the
people
were
all
converted
unto
the
Lord
,
upon
all
the
face
of
the
Jand
both
Nephites
and
Lamanites
,
and
there
were
no
contentions
and
disputations
among
them
,
and
every'
man
did
deal
justly
:
one
with
another
;
and
they
had
all
things
common
among
them
,
therefore
there
were
not
rich
and
poor
,
bond
and
free
,
but
they
were
all
made
free
,
and
partakers
of
the
heaven
ly
git
nd
it
came
to
.
pass
that
the
thirty
and
seventh
yea
!
passed
away
also
,
and
there
still
continued
to
be
peac
?
in
the
land
.
And
there
were
great
and
marvelous
works
wrought
:
by
the
disciples
of
Jesus
,
insomuch
that
:
they
.
did
-
heal
the
sick
,
and
raise
the
dead
,
.
and
eause
the
lame
to
walk
,
and
the
blind
to
receive
their
sight
;
and
the
-
deafto
hear
;
and
allmanner
of
miracles
did
they
work
among
:
the
children
of
men
;
and
in
nothing
did
they
work
.
miracles
save
it
were
in
:
the
name
of
Jesus
...-
And
thus
.
did
the
thirty
and
.
eighth
year
pass
away
,
and
also
the
thirty
and
ninth
,,
andthe
ory
and
first
,
and
the
forty
and
second
;
yea
,
even
ut
til
forty
and
nine
years
had
passed
away
,
and
also
the
fifty
and
first
,.
and
the
:
fifty
and
second
;
yea
,
and
even
until
fifty
and
nine
years
had
passed
away
;
and
the
[File:541]
Lord
did
prosper
them
exceedingly
,
in
the
land
;
yea
,
insomuch
that
they
did
fill
cities
eosin
where
shee
hast
been
cities
burned
;
yea
,
even
that
great
city
Zarahemladid
they
cause
to
be
buillagain
.
But
there
were
many
cities
which
had
been
sunk
,
and
Waters
came
up
inthe
stead
thereof
;
therefore
these
cities
could
not
be
renewed
.
And
now
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
of
Nephi
did
wax
strong
,
and
did
multiply
exceeding
fast
,
and
-
became
an
exceeding
fair
and
delightsome
people
.
And
they
were
married
,
and
given
in
marriage
,
and
were
blessed
according
to
the
multitude
of
the
promisee
which
the
Lord
had
made
unto
them
.
And
they
didnot
.
walk
any
more
after
the
performances
and
ordinances
of
the
law
of
Moses
,
but
they
did
walk
after
thecommandinents
which
they
had
received
from
their
Lord
and
their
God
,
continuing
in
fasting
and
prayer
,
and
in
meeting
together
oft
,
both
to
pray
and
to
hear
theword
of
the
Lord
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
no
contention
among
all
the
people
,
in
all
the
land
,
but
.
there
were
mighty
miracles
wrought
among
the
disciples
of
Jesus
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
seventy
and
first
year
passed
.
away
,
and
also
the
seventy
and
second
:
year
;
yea
,
and
in
fine
,
till
the
seventy
and
ninth
year
had
passed
away
:
yea
,
even
an
hundred
years
had
passed
away
,
and
the
disciples
of
Jesus
,
whom
he
had
chosen
,
had
all
gone
to
the
paradise
of
God
,
save
it
were
the
three
-
who
should
tarry
;
and
there
were
other
disciples
ordained
in
:
their
stead
;
and
also
many
of
that
generation
which
had
passed
away
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
no
contention
in
the
land
,
because
of
the
-
love
of
God
which
did
dwell
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
:
And
there
were
no
envyings
,
nor
strifes
,
nor
tumulis
,
nor
whoredoms
,
nor
lyings
,
nor
murders
,
nor
any
mariner
of
lasciviousness
;
and
surely
there
could
not
bea
happier
people
among
all
the
people
who
had
been'created
by
the
hand
of
God
;
there
were'no
robbers
,
nor
.
murderers
,,
neither
were
there
Lamanites
,
orany
manner
of
ites
;
but
they
were
in
one
,
the
chil
dren
of
Christ
,
and
heirs
to
the
kingdom
of
God
;
and
how
blessed
were
they
,
for
the
Lord
did
bless
them
in
all
their
doings
;.
yea
,
even
they
were
blessed
and
proapered
,
until
amhundred
and
ten
years
had
passed
away
;
and
the
first
:
generation
from
:
Christ
had
passed
away
,
and
there
was
no
contention
in
all
the
land

it
came
to

that

that
kept
this
last
reeord

(

he
kept
it

his
son

it

he

he

eighty

had

upon

it

Amos
died

of
Christ
,)
and
his
son
Amos
kept
the
record
in
.
his
stead
;
and
he
also
kept
it
upon
the
plates
of
Nephi
;
and
it
was
also
written
in
the
book
of
Nephi
,
which
is
this
book
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
two
hundred
years
had
.
passed
away
,
and
the
second
generation
had
all
passed
away
save
it
were
a
few
.
And
now
I
,
Mormon
,
would
that
ye
should
know
that
the
people
had
multiplied
,
insomuch
that
they
were
spread
upon
:
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
that
they
had
become
exceeding
rich
,
because
of
their
prosperity
in
Christ
.
And
now
in
this
two
hundred
and
first
year
,
there
began
to
be
among
them
those
who
were
lifted
up
in
pride
,
such
as
the
wearing
of
costly
apparel
,
and
all
manner
of
fine
pearls
,
and
of
the
fine
things
of
the
world
,
And
from
that
time
forth
they
did
have
their
goods
and
their
substance
no
more
common
among
them
,
and
they
began
to
be
divided
into
classes
,
and
they
began
to
build
up
churches
unto
themselves
,
to
get
gain
,
and
began
to
deny
the
true
church
.
of
Christ
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
two
hundred
and
ten
years
had
passed
away
there
were
many
churches
in
the
land
;
yea
,
there
were
many
churches
which
pro
fessed
to
know
-
the
Christ
,
and
yet
they
did
deny
the
more
parts
of
-
his
gospel
,
insomuch
that
they
did
re
ceive
all
manner
of
wickedness
,
and
did
administer
that
which
was
sacred
unto
him
to
whom
it
had
been
forbidden
,
because
of
unworthiness
.
And
this
church
did
multiply
exceedingly
,
beciiuse
of
iniquity
,
and
be
cause
of
the
power
of
satan
who
did
get
hold
upon
their
hearts
.
And
again
,
there
was
another
cht
which
denied
the
Christ
;
and
they
did
.
persecute
the
true
church
of
Christ
,
because
of
their
humility
,
and
their
belief
in
Christ
;
and
they
did
.
despise
them
,
because
of
,
the
many
.
miracles
.
which
..
were
wrought
among
them
;
therefore
they
did
.
exercise
power
and
authority
over
the
disciples
of
Jesus
who
did
tary
[File:543]
with
them
,
and
they
did
cast
them
into
prison
;
but
by
the'
power
of
the
word
of
God
,
which
was
in
them
,
the
prisons
were
rent
in
twain
,
ahd
they
went
forth
doing
mighty
miracles
among
them
.
Nevertheless
,
and
notwithstanding
all
these
miracles
the
people
did
harden
their
hearts
,
and
did
seek
to
kill
them
,
even
ag
the
Jews
at
Jerusalem
sought
to
kill
Jesus
,
according
to
his
word
,
and
they
did
cast
them
into
furnaces
of
fire
,
and
they
came
forth
receiving
no
harm
;
and
they
also
cast
them
into
dens
of
wild
beasts
,
and
they
did
play
with
the
wild
beasts
even
as
a
child
with
a
lamb
;
and
they
did
come
forth
from
among
them
,
receiving
no
harm
.
Nevertheless
,
the
people
did
harden
their
hearts
,
for
they
were
led
by
many
priests
and
false
prophets
to
build
up
many
churches
,
and
to
do
all
manner
of
iniquity
.
And
they
did
smite
upon
the
people
of
Jesus
;
but
the
people
of
Jesus
did
not
smite
again
.
And
thus
they
did
dwindle
in
unbelief
and
wickedness
,
from
year
to
year
,
even
until
two
hundred
and
thirty
years
had
passed
away
.
And
now
it
came
lo
pass
in
this
year
,
yea
,
in
the
two
hundred
and
thirty
and
first
year
,
there
was
a
great
division
among
the
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
this
year
there
arose
a
people
who
were
called
the
Nephites
,
and
they
were
true
believers
in
Christ
;
and
among
them
there
were
those
who
were
called
by
the
Lamanites
,
Jacobites
,
and
Josephites
,
and
Zoramites
;
therefore
the
true
believers
in
Christ
,
and
the
true
worshipers
of
Christ
,
(
among
whom
were
the
three
disciples
of
Jesus
who
should
tarry
,)
were
called
Nephites
,
and
Jacobites
,
and
Josephites
,
and
Zoramites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
who
rejected
the
gospel
,
were
called
Lamanites
,
and
Lemuelites
and
Ishmaelites
;
and
they
did
not
dwindle
in
unbelief
,
but
they
did
wilfully
rebel
against
the
gospel
of
Christ
;
and
they
did
teach
their
children
chat
they
should
not
believe
,
even
as
their
fathers
,
ftom
the
beginning
,
did
dwindle
.
Â©
And
it
was
because
of
the
wickedness
and
abominations
of
their
fathers
,
even
as
it
was
m
the
beginning
.
And
they
were
taught
to
hate
the
children
of
God
,
even
as
the
Lamanites
were
taught
to
hate
the
children
of
Nephi
,
from
the
beginning
.
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
two
hundred
and
forty
and
four
years
had
passed
away
,
and
thus
were
the
affairs
of
the
people
.
And
the
more
wicked
part
of
the
people
did
wax
strong
,
and
became
exceeding
more
nu
[File:544]
merous
.
than
were
the
people
of
God
,
And
they
did
still
continue
to
build
up
churches
unto
themselves
,
and
adorn
them
with
all
manner
of
precious
things
-.
And
thus
did
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
pass
away
,
and
also
two
hundred
and
sixty
years
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
wicked
part
of
the
people
began
again
to
build
up
the
secret
oaths
and
combinations
of
Gaddianton
.
And
also
the
people
who
were
called
the
people
of
Nephi
,
began
to
be
proud
in
their
hearts
,
because
of
their
exceeding
riches
,
and
become
vain
,
like
unto
their
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
.
And
from
this
time
,
the
disciples
began
to
sorrow
for
the
sins
of
the
world
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
three
hundred
years
had
passed
away
,
both
.
the
people
of
Nephi
and
the
Lamanites
had
become
exceeding
wicked
one
like
unto
another
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
robbers
of
Gaddianton
did
spread
over
all
the
face
of
the
land
;
and
there
were
none
that
were
righteous
,
save
it
were
the
disciples
of
Jesus
.
And
gold
and
silver
did
they
lay
up
in
store
in
abundance
,
and
did
traffic
in
all
manner
of
traffic
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
three
hundred
and
five
years
had
passed
away
,
(
and
the
people
did
still
remain
in
wickedness
,
)
Amos
died
,
and
his
brother
Ammaron
,
did
keep
the
record
in
his
stead
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
three
hundred
and
twenty
years
had
passed
away
,
Ammaron
,
being
constrained
by
the
Holy
Ghost
,
did
hide
up
the
records
which
were
sacred
;
yea
,
even
all
the
sacred
records
wbich
had
been
handed
.
down
from
generation
to
generation
,
which
were
sacred
,
even
until
the
three
hundred
and
twentieth
year
from
the
coming
-
of
Christ
.
And
he
did
hide
them
up
unto
the
Lord
,
that
they
might
come
again
unto
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
Jacob
,
Senoeciiny
to
the
prophecies
and
the
promises
of
the
Lord
.
And
thus
is
the
end
of
the
record
of
Ammaron
.

BOOK
OF
MORMON

CHAPTER
J
.
Axp
now
I
,
Mormon
,
make
a
record
of
the
things
which
I
have
both
seen
and
heard
,
and
eall
it
the
book
of
Mormon
.
And
about
the
time
that
Ammaron
hid
up
the
recores
unto
the
Lord
,
he
came
unto
me
,
(
I
being
about
ten
years
of
age
;
and
I
began
to
be
learned
somewhat
.
after
the
manner
of
the
learning
of
my
people
,)
and
Ammaron
said
unto
me
,
I
perceive
that
thou
arta
seber
child
,
and
:
art
quick
to
observe
;
therefore
when
ye
are
about
twenty
and
four
years
old
,
I
would
that
ye
should
remember
the
things
that
ye
have
observed
concerning
this
people
;
and
when
ye
are
of
that
age
,
go
to
the
land
Antum
,
unto
a
hill
,
which
shall
be
called
Shim
;
and
there
have
I
deposited
unto
the
Lord
,
all
the
sacred
engravings
coneerning
this
.
people
..
And
behold
,
ye
siall
take
the
pale
of
Nephi
unto
yourself
,
and
the
remainder
shall
ye
leave
in
the
place
where
they
are
;
and
ye
shall
engrave
on
the
plates
of
Nephi
,
all
the
things
that
ye
have
observed
concerning
this
people
.
And
I
,
Mormon
,
being
a
descendant
of
Nephi
,
(
and
my
father's
name
was
Mormon
,)
I
remembered
the
things
which
Ammaron
commanded
me
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
J
,
being
eleven
years
:
old
,
Was
carried
by
my
father
into
the
land
southward
,
even
to
the
land
of
Zarahemla
;
the
whole
face
of
the
land
having
become
covered
with
buildings
,
and
the
people
were
as
numerous
almost
,
as
it
were
the
sand
of
the
sea
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
this
year
,
there
began
to
be
a
war
between
the
Nephites
,
who
consisted
of
the
Nephites
,
and
the
Jacobites
,
and
the
Josephites
,
and
the
Zoramites
;
ahd
this
war
was
between
the
Nephites
,
and
the
LLamanites
,
and
the
Lemuelites
,
and
.
the
Ishmaelites
.
Now
the
Lamanites
,
andthe
Lemuelites
,
and
the
Ishmaelites
,
were
called
Lamanites
,
and
the
two'
parties
were
Nephites
and
Lamanites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
war
began
to
be
among
them
in
the
borders
of
Zarahemla
,
by
the
waters
of
Sidon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
had
.
gathered
together
a
great
number
of
men
,
even
to
exceed
the
[File:546]
number
of
thirty
thousand
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
have
in
this
same
year
a
number
of
battles
,
in
the
which
the
Nephites
did
beat
the
Lamanites
,
and
did
slay
many
of
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
withdrew
their
design
,
and
there
was
peace
settled
in
the
land
,:
and
peace
did
remain
for
the
space
of
about
four
years
,
that
there
was
no
blood
shed
..
But
wickedness
did
prevail
upon
the
face
of
the
whole
land
,
insomuch
that
the
Lord
did
take
away
his
beloy
.
ed
disciples
,
and
the
work
of
miracles
and
of
healing
did
cease
,
because
of
the
iniquity
of
the
people
.
And
there
were
no
gifts
from
the
Lord
,
and
the
Holy
Ghost
did
not
come
upon
any
,
because
of
their
wickedness
and
unbelief
.
And
I
,
being
fifteen
years
of
age
,
and
being
somewhat
of
a
sober
mind
,
therefore
L
was
visited
of
the
Lord
,
and
tasted
,
and
knew
of
the
goodness
of
Jesus
.
And
Idid
endeavor
to
preach
unto
this
people
,
but
my
mouth
was
shut
,
and
I
was
forbidden
that
should
preach
unto
them
;
for
behold
they
had
wilfully
rebelled
against
their
God
,
and
the
beloved
disciples
were
taken
away
out
of
the
land
,
because
of
their
iniquity
.
But
I
did
remain
among
them
,
butI
was
forbidden
to
preach
unto
them
,
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
;
and
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
,
the
land
was
cursed
for
their
sake
.
And
these
Gaddianton
robbers
,
who
were
among
the
Lamanites
,
did
infest
the
land
,
insomuch
that
the
inhabitants
thereof
began
to
hide
up
their
treasures
in
the
earth
;
and
they
became
slippery
,
because
the
Lord
had
cursed
the
land
,
that
they
could
not
hold
them
,
nor
retain
them
again
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
were
soreeries
,
and
witcherafts
,
and
magics
:;
and
the
power
of
the
evil
one
was
wrought
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
even
unto
the
fulfilling
of
all
.
the
words
of
Abinadi
;
and
also
Samuel
the
Lamanite
.
And
it
came
to
pass
in
that
same
year
,
there
began
to
be
a
war
again
between
the
Nephites
and
the
Lamanites
.
And
notwithstanding
I
being
young
,
was
large
in
stature
,
therefore
the
people
of
Nephi
appointed
me
that
I
should
be
their
leader
,.
or
the
leader
of
their
armies
..
Therefore
it
came
to
pass
that
in
my
sixteenth
year
I
did
go
.
forth
at
the
head
.
of
an
army
.
of
the
Nephites
,
against
the
Lamanites
;
therefore
three
hundred
.
and
twenty
and
six
years
had
passed
away
,
..
And
it
.
came
fone
that
,
in
the
three
hundred
and
twenty
and
.
seventh
year
,
the
lamanites
did
.
come
.
upon
us
with
exe
ceeding
great
power
,
insomuch
that
.
they
did
frighten
[File:547]
my
armies
;
therefore
they
would
not
fight
,
and
they
begen
to
retreat
:
towards
the
-
north
countries
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
come
to
the
city
of
Angola
,
and
we
did
take
possession
of
the
:
city
,
and
make
preparations
to
defend
ourselves
against
the
Lamanites
.-.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
fortify
the
city
with
our
mights
;
but
notwithstanding
all
our
fortifications
,
the
Lamanites
did
come
upon
us
,
and
did
:
drive
us
.
out
of
the
city
.
And
they
did
also
drive
us
forth
out
.
of
the
land
of
David
.
And
we
marched
forth
and
came
to
the
land
of
Joshua
,
which
was
in
the
berders
west
,
by
the
seashore
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
.
we
did
gather
in
our
people
as
fast
as
it
were
possible
,
that
we
might
get
them
together
inone
hody
..
But
behold
,
the
land
was
filled
with
robbers
and
with
Lamanites
;
and
notwithstanding
the
great
destruction
which
hung
over
my
people
,
they
did
not
repent
of
their
evil
doings
;
therefore
there
was
blood
and
carnage
spread
throughout
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
both
on
the
part
of
the
Nephites
,
and
also
on
the
part
of
the
Lamanites
;
and
it
was
one
complete
revolution
throughout
all
the
face
of
the
land
.
And
now
the
Lamanites
had
a
.
king
,
and
his
name
was
Aaron
;
and
he
came
against
us
with
an
army
of
forty
and
four
thousand
.
And
behold
,
I
withstood
him
with
forty
and
two
thousand
..
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
beat
him
with
my
army
,
that
he
fled
before
me
,
And
behold
,
all
this
was
done
and
three
hundred
and
thirty
years
had
passed
away
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Nephites
began
to
repent
of
their
iniquity
,
and
began
to
cry
even
as
had
been
prophesied
by
Samuel
the
prophet
;
for
behoid
no
man
could
keep
that
which
was
his
own
,
for
the
thieves
,
and
the
robbers
,
and
the
murderers
,
and
the
magic
art
,
and
the
witchcraft
which
was
in
the
land
.
Thus
there
began
to
be
a
mourning
and
a
lamentation
in
all
the
land
,
because
of
these
things
;.
and
more
especially
among
the
ple
of
Nephi
.
Andit
came
to

that
when

,
Mormon
,
saw
their
lamentation
,
and
their
mourning
,
and
.
their
sorrow
before
the
Lord
,
my
heart
did
begin
to
rejoice
within
me
,
knowing
the
mercies
and
the
long
suffering
of
the
Lord
,
therefore
supposing
that
he
would
be
merciful
unto
them
,
that
they
would
again
become
a
righteous
people
.
But
behold
this
my
joy
was
vain
,
for
their
sorrowing
was
not
unto
repentance
,
because
of
the
goodness
of
God
,
bat
it
:
was
rather
the
sorrowiag
of
the
damned
,
because
the
Lord
would
not
always
suffer
them
to
take
happi+
[File:548]
ness
im
sin
.
And
:
they
did
not
come
unto
Jesus
with
broken
heartsand
contrite
spirits
,
but
they
did
curse
God
,
and
wish
to
die
,
Nevertheless
they
would
struggle
with
the
sword
for
their
lives
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
my
sorrow
did
return
unto
me
again
,
and
I
saw
that
the
day
of
grace
was
past
with
them
,
both
temporally
and
spiritually
,
for
[saw
thoudands
of
them
hewn
down
in
open
rebellion
against
their
God
and
heaped
up
as
dung
upon
the
face
of
the
land
.
And
thus
three
hundred
and
forty
and
four
years
had
passed
away
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
forty
and
fifth
year
,
the
Nephites
did
begin
to
flee
before
the
Lamanites
,
and
they
were
pursued
until
they
eame
even
to
the
land
of
Jashon
,
before
it
-
was
posstble
to
stop
them
in
their
retreat
.
And
now
the
city
of
Jashon
was
near
the
land
where
Ammaron
had
deposited
the
records
unto
the
Lord
,
that
they
might
not
be
destroyed
,
And
behold
I
had
gone
according
to
the
word
oF
Ammaron
,
and
taken
the
plates
of
Nephi
,
and
did
make
a
record
according
to
the
words
of
Ammaron
.
And
upon
the
plates
of
Nephi
I
did
make
a
fall
account
of
all
the
wickedness
and
abominations
;
but
upon
these
plates
I
did
forbear
to
make
a
full
account
of
their
wickedness
and
abominations
,
for
behold
,
a
continual
scene
of
wickedness
and
abominations
has
been
before
mine
eyes
ever
since
I
have
been
sufficient
to
behold
the
ways
of
man
.
And
wo
is
me
,
because
of
their
wickedness
,
for
my
heart
has
been
filled
-
with
sorrow
because
of
their
wickedness
,
all
my
days
;
nevertheless
,
1
know
that
I
shall
be
lifted
up
at
the
last
day
.
And
it
came'to
pass
that
in
this
year
the
people
of
Nephi
again
were
hunted
and
driven
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
were
driven
forth
until
we
had
come
northward
to
the
land
which
was
called
Shem
.
And
itcame
to
pass
that
we
did
fortify
the
city
of
Shem
,
and
we
did
gather
in
our
people
as
much
as
it
were
possible
,
that
perhaps
we
might
save
them
from
destruction
.
And
it'
came
to
pass
in
the
three
hundred
and
forty
and
sixth
year
,
they
began
to
come
upon
us
again
,
:
And
it
came
to
pass
that
[
did
speak
unto
my
people
,
and
did
urgethem
:
with
great
energy
,
that
they
would
stand
boldly
before
:
the
Lamanites
,
and
fight
for
their
wives
,
and
their
children
,
and
their
houses
and
their
homes
.
And
my
:
words'did
:
arouse
them
somewhat
to
vigor
,
insomuch
:
that
they
did
not
flee
from
[File:549]
before
the
Lamanites
,
but
did
stand
with
bold
.
nese
against
them
,
And
it
came
to
.
pass
that
we
did
contend
with
an
army
of
thirty
thousand
,
against
an
army
of
fifly
thousand
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
stand
before
them
with
such
firmness
,
that
they
did
flee
from
before
us
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
fled
,
we
did
pursue
them
with
our
armies
,
and
did
meet
them
again
,
and
did
beat
them
;
nevertheless
the
strength
of
the
Lord
was
not
with
us
;
ea
,
we
were
left
to
ourselves
,
that
the
spirit
of
the
ord
did
not
abide
in
us
;
therefore
we
had
become
weak
,
like
unto
our
brethren
.
And
my
heart
did
sorrow
because
of
this
the
great
calamity
of
my
people
;
because
of
their
wickedness
and
their
abominations
..
But
behold
we
did
go
forth
against
the
Lamanites
,
and
the
robbers
of
Gaddianton
,
until
we
had
again
taken
possession
of
the
lands
of
our
inheritance
.
And
the
three
hundred
and
forty
and
ninth
year
had
passed
away
.
And
in
the
three
hundred
and
fiftieth
year
,
we
made
a
treaty
with
the
Lamanites
and
the
robbers
of
Gaddianton
,
in
which
we
did
get
the
lands
of
our
inheritance
divided
.
And
the
Lamanites
did
give
untous
the
land
northward
;
yea
,
even
to
the
narrow
passage
which
led
into
the
land
southward
.
And
we
did
give
unto
the
Lamanites
all
the
land
southward
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
not
,
come
to
battle
again
until
ten
years
more
had
passed
Â©
away
,
And
behold
,
I
had
employed
my
people
,
the
Nephites
,
in
preparing
their
lands
and
their
arms
against
the
time
of
battle
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
say
unto
me
,
ery
unto
this
people
repent
ye
,
and
come
unto
me
and
be
ye
baptized
,
and
build
up
again
my
church
,
and
ye
shall
be
spared
.
And]
did
cry
unto
this
people
,
but
it
was
in
vain
,
and
they
did
not
realize
that
it
was
the
Lord
that
had
spared
them
,
and
granted
unto
them
a
chance
for
repentance
.
And
behold
they
did
harden
their
hearts
against
the
Lord
their
God
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
after
this
tenth
year
had
passed
away
,
making
,
in
the
whole
,
three
hundred
and
sixty
years
:
from
the
coming
of
Christ
,
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
sent
an
epistle
unto
me
,.
which
gave
unto
me
to
know
that
they
were
preparing
.
to
come
again
to
battle
against
us
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
did
cause
my
people
that
they
should
guther
themselves
together
at
the
land
Desolation
,
to
.
a
city
which
was
in
the
borders
,
by
the
narrow
pase
which
lead
.
into
the
land
southward
.
And
there
[File:550]
we
did
place
our
armies
,
that
we
might
stop
the
:
armies
of
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
might
not
get
possession
of
any
of
our
lands
;
therefore
we
did
fortify
against
them
with
all
our
force
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
and
first
year
,
the
Lamanites
did
come
down
to
the
city
of
Desolation
to
battle
,
against
us
;
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
that
year
,
we
did
beat
them
,
insomuch
that
they
did
return
to
their
own
lands
again
,
And
in
the
three
hundred
and
.
sixty
and
second
year
,
they
did
come
down
again
to
battle
.
And
we
did
beat
them
again
,
and
did
slay
a
great
number
of
them
,
and
their
dead
were
cast
into
the
sea
.
And
now
because
of
this
great
thing
which
my
people
,
the
Nephites
,
had
done
,
they
began
to
boast
in
their
own
strength
,
and
began
to
.
swear
before
the
heavens
,
that
they
would
avenge
themselves
of
the
blood
of
their
brethren
who
had
been
slain
by
their
enemies
.
And
they
did
swear
by
the
heavens
,
and
also
by
the
throne
of
God
,
that
they
would
go
up
to
battle
against
their
enemies
,
and
would
cut
them
off
from
the
face
of
the
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
,
Mormon
,
did
utterly
refuse
from
this
time
forth
,
to
be
a
commander
and
4
leader
of
this
people
,
because
of
their
wickedness
and
abomination
.
.
Behold
,
I
had
led
them
,
notwithstand
.
ing
their
wickedness
,
I
had
lead
them
many
times
to
battle
,
and
had
loved
them
,
according
to
the
love
of
God
which
was
in
me
,
with
all
my
heart
;
and
my
soul
had
been
poured
out
in
prayer
unto
my
God
all
the
day
long
,
for
them
;
nevertheless
,
it
was
without
faith
,
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
.
And
thrice
have
I
delivered
them
out
of
the
hands
of
.
their
enemies
,
and
they
have
repented
not
of
their
sins
.
And
when
they
had
sworn
by
all
that
had
been
forbidden
them
,
by
our
Lord
and
Saviour
Jesus
Christ
,
that
they
would
go
up
.
unto
their
.
enemies
to
battle
,
and
avenge
themselves
of
the
blood
.
of
their
brethren
,
behold
,
the
voice
of
the
Lord
cameunto
me
,
saying
,
vengeance
1s
mine
,
and
I
will
repay
;
and
because
this
people
repented
not
after
I
had
delivered
them
,
behold
,
they
,
shall
be
:
cut
off
from
the
face
of
the
earth
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
I
:
utterly
refused
to
go
up
against
mine
enemies
;)
and
I
did
-
even
as
the
Lord
had
commanded

CHAPTER

now
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
and
third
year
,
the
Nephites
did
go
up
with
their
armies
to
battle
against
the
Lamanites
,
out
of
the
land
Desolation
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
armies
of
the
Nephites
were
driven
back
again
to
the
land
of
Desolation
.
And
while
they
were
yet
weary
,
afresh
army
of
the
Lamanttes
did
come
upon
them
;
and
:
they
had
a
sore
battle
,
insomuch
that
the
Lamanites
did
take
possession
of
the
city
Desolation
,
and
did
slay
many
of
the
Nephites
,
and
did
take

And
it
-
came
to
passin
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
and

year
,
the
Laimanites
did
come
against
the
eity

that

Aind'it

came
to'

:
that
:
they
Were
repulsed

and
driven
back
by
the
Nephites
.-
And
when
the
Neptites
saw
that
they
had
driven
the
Lamanites
,
they
did
again
boast
of
their'strength
;
and
+
they
went
forth
in
their
own
might
,
and
:
took
possession
again
of
the
city
Desolation

And
now
all

there
had
been
thousands
slain
on
both
sides

both

:
Lamanites

upon

to
battle
;
and
yet
the
Nephites
repented
not
of
the
evil
they
had
done
,
but
persisted
in
their
wickedness
continually
.
And
it
is
impossible
for
the

to
describe
,

for
man
to
write
a
perfec

description
of
the
horrible
scene
of
the
blood

carnage
which
was
among
the
people
;
both
of

hardened

that

And
it

to
pass
that
the
Lamanites'did

possession
of
the

this
because

this
year
they
did
come
down
against
the
)
Nephites
with
all
their
powers
;
and
they
were
not
tuimbered
because
of
the
greatness
-
of
their
number
.
And
from
this
time
forth
did
the
Nephites
gain
no
power
over
the
Lamanites
,
but
began
to
be
swept
off
by
them
even
as
-
a
dew
before
the
sun
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lamanites
did
come
down
against
the
city
Desolation
;
and
there
was
an
exceedimg
sore
battle
fought
in
the
Jand
Desolation
,
in
the
which
they
did
beat
the
Nephites
,
And
they
fled
again
-
from
before
them
,
and
they
came
to
the
.
city
Boaz
;
and
there
they
did
stand
against
the
Lamanites
with
exceeding
boldness
,
insomuch
that
the
Lamanites
did
not
beat
them
until
they
had
come
agnin
the
second
time
.
And
.
when
they
had
come
the
second
time
,
the
Nephites
were
driven
and
slaughtered
with
an
exceeding
great
slaughter
;
their
women
and
their
children
_
Were
again
sacrified
unto
idols
,
And
it
came
to
pass
Â©
that
the
Nephite
did

again
flee
from

taking
all

the

for
they
looked
upon
me
as'though'{
could

them
from
their
afflictions
.
But
behold
,
I
was
without
hopes
,
for
I
knew
the'
judgmentsof
the
Lord
which
should
come
upon
them
;
for
:
they
repented
not
of
their
iniquities
,
but
did
struggle
-
for
their

lives
,
without
calling
upon
that

And
it
came
to

desire
to

up
the

of

in
casting
before
them
such
an
awful
scene
of
blood
and
carnage
as
was
laid
before

eyes
,
but
I
knowing
that
these
things
must
surely
be
made
known
,
and
that
-
all
things
which
are
hid
must
.
be
revealed
upon

,
and
also
that
a

knowledge
of
these

must
come
unto
the
remnant
of
these

,
and
also
unto
the
Gentiles
,
which
the
Lord
hath
said
should
scatter
this
people
,
and
this
peers
should
be
counted
as
nought
among

,
therefore
I
write
a
small
abridgement
,
daring
not
to
give
a
full
account
of
the
things
which
I
have
seen
,
because
of
the
commandment
.
which
I
have
received
,
and
also
.
that
ye
might
not
have
too
great
sorrow
because
of
the
wickedness
of
this
people
.
And
now
behold
,
this
I
speak
unto
their
seed
,
and
also
to
the
Gentiles
,
who
,
have
care
for
the
house
of
Israel
,
that
.
realize
and
know
from
whence
their
blessings
come
.
For
I
know
,
that
such
will
sorrow
for
the
calamity
of
the
house
of
Israel
;
yea
,
they
will
sorrow
for
the
destruction
of
this

;
they
will
sorrow
that
this

had
not
repented
,
that
they
might
have
been
clasped
in

arms
of
Jesus
.
Now
these
thip
are
wriften
unto
.
the
remnant
of
the
house
.
of
Jacob
;
and
they
are
written
after
this
.
manner
,
because
it
1s
known
of
God
that
wickedness
will
not
.
bring
them
forth
unto
them
;
and
they
are
.
to
be
hid
up
unto

Lord
,
that
they
may
come
forth
-
in
his

.
_
And
this
is
the

have

behold

to
the
commandment
of

,
when

see
fit
,
in

And
behold

they
shall

go

unto
the
un
believing
of
the
Jews
;
and
for
this
intent
shall
they
(
go
)
that
they
may
be
persuaded
that
Jequs
is
the
[File:555]
Christ
,
the
Son
of'
the'
living
God
;
that
the
Father
may
bring
about
,
through
his
most
beloved
,
his
great
eternal
purpose
,
in
restoring
the
Jews
,
or
all
the
house
of
Israel
,
to
the
land
of
their
inheritanee
,
which
the
Lord
their
God
hath
given
them
,
unto
the
fulfilling
of
his
covenant
,
and
also
that
the
seed
of
this
people
may
more
fully
believe
his
gospel
,-
which
shall
go
forth
unto
them
from
the
Gentiles
;
for
this
people
shall
be
scattered
,
and
shall
become
a
dark
,
a
filthy
,
and
a
loathsome
people
,
beyond
thedescription
of
that
which
ever
hath
been
amongst
us
;
yea
,
even
that
which
hath
been
among
the
Lamanites
;
and
this
because
of
.
their
unbelief
and
idolatry
.
For
behold
,
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
hath
already
ceased
to
strive
with
their
fathers
,
and
they
are
without
Christ
and
God
in
the
world
,
and
they
are
driven
about
as
chaff
before
the
wind
.
They
were
once
a
delightsome
people
,
and
they
had
Christ
for
their
Shepherd
;
yea
,
they
were
led
even
by
God
,
the
Father
.
But
now
,
behold
they
are
led
about
by
satan
,
even'as
chaff
is
driven
before
the
wind
,
or
as
4
vessel
is
tossed
about
upon

waves
,
without
sail
orahchor
,
or
without
any
thing
wherewith
to
steer
her
;
and
even
as
she
is
,
soare
they
.
And
behold
,
the
Lord
hath
reserved
their
blessings
,
which
they
might
have
received
in
the
land
,
for
the
Gentiles
,
who
shall
possess
the
land
.
But
behold
,
it
shall
come
to
pass
Uthat
they
shall
be
driven
and
scattered
by
the
Gentiles
;
and
after
they
have
been
driven
and
scattered
by
the
Gentiles
,
behold
,
then
will
the
Lord
remember
the
covenant
which
he
made
unto
Abraham
,
and
unto
all
the
house
of
Isracl
.
And
also
the
Lord
will
remember'the
prayers
of
the
righteous
,
which
have
been
put
up
unto
him
for
them
.
And
then
,
O
ye
Gentiles
,
how
can
ye
stand
before
the
power
of
God
,
except
ye
shall
repent
and
turn
from
your
evil
ways
!
Know
ye
not
that
ye
are
in
the
hands
of
God
?
Know
ye
not
that
he
hath
all
power
,
and
at
his
great
command
the
earth
shall
be
rolled
together
as
a
scroll
?
Therefore
repent
ye
,
and
humble
yourselves
before
him
,
lest
he
shall
come
out
in
justice
against
you
;
lest
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
Jacob
shall
go
forth
among
you
as
a
lion
,
and
tear
you'in
pieces
,
and
there
is
none
to
deliver
.

CHAPTER
IIL
.
,
Axp
now
I
finish
my
record
concerning
the
destruction
of
my
people
,
the
Nephites
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
march
forth
before
the
Lamanites
,
And
T
Mormon
,
wrote
an'
epistle
unto
the
king
of
the
Lamanites
,
and
desired
of
him
that
he
would
grant
unto
us
that
we
might
gather
together
our
people
unto
the
land
of
Cumorah
,
by
a
bill
which
was
called
Cumorab
,
and
there
we
would
give
them
battle
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that'the
king
of
the
Lamanites
did
grant
unto
me
the
thing
which
[
desired
.
And
it
came
to
pags
that
wre
did
march
forth
to
the
land
of
Cumorah
,
and
.
we
did
piteh
our
tents
round
about
the
hill
Cumorah
;
and
it
was
in
a
land
of
many
waters
,
rivers
and
fountains
;
and
here
we
had
hope
to
gain
advantage
over
the
Lamanites
.
And
when
three
hundred
and
eighty
and
four
years
had
passed
away
,
we
had
gathered
in
all
the
remainder
of
our
people
unto
the
land
Cumorah
.
__
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
we
had
gathered
in
all
.
our
people
in
oneto
the
Jand
of
Cumorah
,
behold
I
,
Mormon
,
began
to
be
old
;
and
knowing
it
to
be
the
last
atruggle
of
my
people
,
and
having
:
been
commanded
of
the
Lord
that
I
should
not
suffer
that
.
the
records
which
had
been
hauded
down
by
our
fathers
,
which
were
sacred
,
to'
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
Lamanites
,
(
for
the
Lamanites
would
:
destroy
them
,)
therefore
I
made
this
record
out
of
the
plates
of
Nephi
,
and
hid
up
in
the
hill
Cumorah
,
all
the
records
.
which
had
-
been
entrusted
to
me
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
,
save
it
.
were
these
few
plates
which
I
gave
unto
my
son
Moroni
.
And
it
:
came
.
to
pass
that
my
people
,
with
their
wives
and'their
children
,
did'
now
behold
.
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
marching
towards
them
:
and
with
.
that
awful
:
fear
of
death
which
fills
the
breasts
.
of
all
the
wick
ed
,
did
they
await
to
receive
them
.
.
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
they
come
to
:
battle
against

ua
,
and
every
soul
was
filled
with
terror
,
because
of
the
greatness
.
of
their
nambers
..
And
it
-
came
to
pass
that
they
.
did
fall
upon
my
people
with

the
swordy
and
:
with

the
bow
,
and
with
the
arrow
,:
and
with

with

of

of

And

it

came'
to

pass
that
my

were
hewn
down
,

even
my
ten

who
were
with

,
and
I
fell
wounded
in
the
midst
:
and
they
passed
by
me
that
they
did
not
put
an
end
to
my
life

And
when

had
gone
through

hewn
down

the

these

And
now
behold

I
would
speak
somewhat
unto

it
so
be
that
God

may
give

CHAPTER
Iv
.
Brnoxn
I
,
Moroni
,
do
finish
the
record
of
my
Father
Mormon
.
Behold
,
I
have
but
few
things
to
write
,
which
things
I
have
been
commanded
of
my
father
.
And
now
it
came
to
pags
that
after
the
great
and
tremendous
battle
at
Cumorah
,
behold
,
the
Nephites
who
had
escaped
into
the
country
southward
,
were
hunted
by
the
Lamanites
,
until
they
were
all
destroyed
;
and
my
father
also
was
killed
by
them
;
and
I
,
even
remain
alone
to
write
the
sad
tale
of
the
destruction
of
my
people
.
But
behold
,
they
are
gone
,
and
I
fulfil
the
commandment
of
my
father
,
And
whether
they
will
slay
me
,
I
know
noty
:
therefore
I
will
write
and
.
hide
up
the
records
in
the
earth
,
and
whither
I
go
it
mattereth
not
.
Behold
,
my
father
hath
made
this
record
,
and
he
-
hath
written
the
intent
thereof
.
And
behold
,
I
.
would
write
it
also
,
if
1
had
room
.
upon
the
plates
;
but
{
have
not
;
and
ore
I
have
none
,
for
I
am
alone
;
my
father
hath
been
slain
in
battle
,
and
all
my
kins
ks
,
and
have
not
friends
nor
whither
to
go
;
and
how
long
the
Lord
will
suffer
that
I
may
live
,
I
know
not
.
Behold
,
four
hundred
years
have
passed
away
since
the
coming
of
our
Lord
and
Saviour
.
And
behold
,
the
Lamanites
have
hunted
my
people
,
the
Nephites
,
down
from
city
to
city
,
and
from
place
to
place
,
even
until
they
are
no
more
;
and
great
has
been
their
fall
;
yea
,
great
and
marvelous
is
the
destruction
of
people
,
the
Nephites
.
And
behold
,
it
is
the
hand
of
the
Lord
which
hath
done
it
.
And
behold
also
,
the
Lamanites
are
at
war
one
with
another
;
and
the
whole
face
of
this
land
is
one
continual
round
of
murder
and
bloodshed
:
and
no
one
knoweth
the
end
of
the
war
.
And
now
behold
,
gay
no
more
concerning
them
,
for
there
are
none
,
save
it
be
the
Lamanites
and
.
robbers
,
that
do
exist
upon
the
face
of
the
land
;
and
there
are
none
that
do
know
the
true
God
,
save
it
be
the
disciPles
of
Jesus
,
who
did
tarry
in
the
land
until
the
wickedness
of
the
people
was
so
great
,
that
the
Lord
would
hot
suffer
them
to
remain
with
the
people
;
and
whetherthey
be
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
no
man
knoweth
.
But
behold
,
my
father
and
I
have
seen
them
,
and
they
have
ministered
unto
us
.
And
whoso
receiveth
this
record
,
and
shall
not
condemn
it
because
of
the
imperfections
which
are
in
it
,
thesame
shall
know
of
greater
things
than
these
.
Behold
,
I
aniâ
Moroni
;
and
were
it
possible
,
I
would
make
all
things
known
unto
you
.
[File:560]
Behold
,
I
make
an
end'
of
:
speaking
concerning
this
people
.
Iam
the
son
of
Mormon
,
and
my
father
was
a
desceridant
of
Nephi
;
'
and
I
am
the
same
who
hideth
up
this
record
-
unto
the
Lord
;
the
plates
thereof
are
of
no
worth
,
becouse
.
of
the
commandment
of
-
the
Lord
,
For
he
truly
saith
,
that
no
one
shall
have
them
to
pet
gain
;
but
the
record
thereof
is
:
of
great
worth
:
and
whoso
shall
bring
it
to
light
,;-
him
will
the
-
Lord
-
bless
,
For
none
can
hdve
power
to
bring
it
to
light
,
save
it
be
given
himiof
God
;
for
God
will'
that
it
shall
be
done
with
an
eye
single'
to
-
his
glory
,
or
the
welfare
of
the
ancient
and
long
dispersed
covenant
people
of
the
Lord
.
And
blessed
be
him
that
shall
bring
this
thing
to
light
;
for
it
shall
be
brought
out
of
darkness
unto
light
,
according
to
the
word
of
God
;
yea
,
it
shall
be
brought
out
of
the
earthy
and
it
shall
shine
forth
out
of
darkness
,
and
come
unto
the
knowledge
of
the
people
;
and
it
shall
be
done
by
the
power
of
God
;
and
if
there
be
faults
,
they
be
the
faults
of
a
man
.
But
behold
,
we
know
no
fault
.
Nevertheless
,
God
knoweth
all
things
;
therefore
he
that
eondemneth
,
let
him
be
aware
lest
he
shall
b2
in
danger
of
hell
fire
.
And
he
that
sayeth
,
shew
unto
me
,
or
ye
shall
be
smitten
,
let
-
him
beware
lest
he
coraracmnioll
that
which
is
forbidden
of
the
Lord
.
For
behold
,
the
same
that
judgeth'rashly
,
shall
be
judged
rashly
again
;
for
according
to
his
works
shall
his
wages
be
;
therefore
,
he
that
smiteth
,
shall
be
smitten
-
again
of
the
Lord
.
Behold
what
the
scripture
says
man
.
shall
:
not'sinite
,
neither
shall
he
judge
;
for
judgment
is
mine
,
saith
the
Lord
;
and
vengeance
is
mine
also
,
and
J
will
repay
.
And
he
that
shall
breathe
out
wrath
and
strifes
against
the
work
of
the
Lord
,
and
against
the
covenant
people
of
the
Lord
,
who
are
the
house
of
Israel
,
and
shall
say
,
we
willdestroy
the
work
of
the
Lord
,
and
the
Lord
will
not
remember
his
covenant
which
he
hath'made
unto
the
house
of
Israel
,
the
same
is
in
danger
to
be
hewn
down
and
cast
into
the
fire
;
for
the
eternal
purposes
of
the
Lord
shall
rol
!
on
,
until
all
his
promises
shall
be
falfilled
:
Search
the
propiecies
of
Isaiah
..
Behold
,
I
cannot
write
them
.
Yea
,
behold
I
say
unto
rou
,
that
those
saints
who
have
gone
before
me
,
who
ave
possessedâ¢this
land
,
shall
ery
;
yea
,
even
from
the
dust
will
they
cry
unto
the
Lord
;
and
:
as
the
Lord
liveth
,
he
will
remember
the'
covenant
which
the'hath
made
with
them
.
And
he
knoweth
their
prayers
,
that
they
were
in
behalf
of
their
brethren
,
And
he
know
[File:561]
@th
their
faith
;
for
in
his
name
could
they
remove
tains
;
and
in
his
name
could
they
cause
the
1
to
shake
;
and
by
the
power
of
his
word
did
they
cause
prisons
to
tumble
to
the
earth
;
yea
,
even
the
fiery
furnace
could
not
harm
them
;
neither
wild
beasts
,
nor
poisonous
serpents
,
because
of
the
power
of
his
word
.
And
behold
,
their
prayers
were
also
ih
behalf
of
him
that
the
Lord
should
suffer
to
brin
these
things
forth
,
And
no
one
need
say
,
they
shal
not
-
come
,
for
they
surely
shall
,
for
the
Lord
hath
spoken
it
;
for
out
of
the
earth
shall
they
come
,
by
the
hand
of
.
the
Lord
,
and
none
can
stay
it
;
and
it
shall
come
in
a
day
when
it
shall
be
said
that
miracles
are
done
away
;
and
it
shall
come
even
as
if
one
should
speak
from
the
dead
.
And
it
shall
come
in
a
day
when
the
blood
of
saints
shall
cry
unto
the
Lord
,
because
of
secret
:
combinations
and
the
works
of
darkness
;
yea
,
it
shall
come
im
a
day
when
the
power
of

shall
be
denied
,
and

become
defiled
,
and

be
lifted

in
the
pride

;
yea
,
even
aday
when

of

and

in
the
pride
of
their
hearts
,
even
to
the
envying
of

who

day
when

and
there
shall
also
be

of

and

of

and
earthquakes
in

places
;
yea
;
it
shall
come
in
a
day
when
there

pollitions
upon

there
shall

and

But

do

value
of

than
that
miscry
which
never
dies
,
because
of
the
praise
of
the
world
.
Why
do
ye
adom
yourselves
with
that
which
hath
no
life
,
and
yet
suffer
the
hungry
,
and
the
needy
,
and
the
:
naked
,
and
the
sick
,
and
the
afflicted
to

by

Yea

why
do
ye
build
up
your
secret
abominstions
to
get
:
gain
,
and
cause
that
widows
should
moura
before
the
Lord
,
and
also
orphans
to
mourn
before
the
Lord
;
and
also
the
blood
of
their
fathers
and
their
husbands
to
cry
unto
the
Lord
from
.
the
ground
,
for
vengeance
upon
your
heads
?
Behold
,
the
sword
of
vengeance
hangeth
over
you
;
and
the
time
soon
cometh
that
he
avengeth
the
blood
of
the
saints
upon
you
,
for
he
will
not
suffer
their
cries
any
longer
.
And
now
,
I
speak
also
concerning
those
who
do
not
believe
in
Christ
...
Behold
,
will
ye
believe
in
the
day
af
your
visitation
,
behold
,
when
the
Lord
shall
come
;
yea
,
even
that
great
day
when
the
earth
shall
be
rolled
together
as
ascroll
,
and
the

shall
melt
with

heat
;
yea
;
in
that
great
day
when
ye
shall
be
brought
to
stand
before
the
Lamb
of
God
,
then
will
ye
say
that
there
is
no
God
?
Then
will
ye
longer
deny
the
Christ
,
or
can
ye
behold
the
Lamb
of
God
?
Do
ye
suppose
that
ye
shall
dwell
with
him
under

consciousness
of

.
be
.
brought
to
see
your
nakedness
before
God
,
and
also
the
glory
of
God
,
and
the
holiness
of
Jesus
Christ
,
it
will
kindle
a
flame
of
.
unquenchable
fire
uponyou
.
O
then
ye
unbelieving
,
turn
ye
unto
the
Lord
;
ery
mightily
unto'the
Father
in
the
name
of
Jesus
,
that
perhaps
ye
may
be
found
spotless
,
pure
,
fair
and
white
,
having
been
cleansed
by
the
blood
of
the
Lamb
,
at
that
great
and
last
day
.
And
again
I
speak
unto
you
,
who
deny
the
revelations
of
God
,
and
say
that
they
are
done
away
,
that
there
are
no
revelations
,
nor
prophecies
,
nor
gifts
,
nor
healing
,
nor
speak5
tongues
,
and
the
interpretation
of
tongues
.
Behold
[I
say
unto
you
,
he
that
denieth
these
thmgs
;
knoweth
not
the
gospel
of
Christ
;
yea
,
he
has
not
read
the
scriptures
;
if
so
,
he
does
not
understand
them
.
For
do
we
not
read
that
God
is
the
same
yesterday
,
easy
,
and
forever
;
and
in
him
there
is
no
variablefess
neither
shadow
.
ot
changing
.
And
now
,
if
ye
have
imagined
up
unto
yourselves
.
a
god
who
doth
vary
,
and
in
him
there
is
shadow
of
changing
,
then
have
ye
imagined
up
unto
yourselves
a
god
whois
nota
Ged
of
miracles
.
But
behold
,
I
will
shew
unto
you
a
God
of
miracles
,
even
the
God
of
Abraham
,
and
the
God
of
Isaac
,
and
the
God
of
Jacob
;
and
it
is
that
same
God
who
created
the
heavens
and
the
earth
,
and
all
things
that
in
.
them
are
.
Behold
,
he
created
Adam
;
and
by
Adam
came
the
fall
of
man
.
And
because
of
the
fall
.
of
man
,
came
Jesus
Christ
,
even
the
Father
and
the
Son
;
and
because
of
Jesus
Christ
came
the
redemption
of
man
.
And
because
of
the
redemption
of
man
,
which
came
by
Jesus
Christ
,
they
are
brought
back
into
the
presence
of
the
Lord
;
yea
,
this
is
wherein
-
all
men
are
redeemed
,
because
the
death
of
Christ
bringeth
to
pass
the
resurrection
,
which
bring
eth
to
pass
a
redemption
from
-
an
endless
sleep
,
from
which
sleep
all
men
shall
be
awoke
by
the
power
of
Ged
;
when
the
tramp
shall
sound
;
and
they
shall
come
forth
,
both
saat
and
great
,
and
all
shall
stand
before
his
bar
,
being
redeemed
and
loosed
from
this
eternal
band
.
of
death
,
which
death
is
a
temporal
death
;
and
then
cometh
the
judgment
of
the
Holy
One
upon
them
;
and
then
cometh
the
time
that
he
that
is
filthy
shall
-
be
filthy
:
still
;
and
he
that
is
righteous
,
shall
.
be
righteous
atill
;:
he
that
is
happy
,
shall
be
happy
still
;
[File:564]
sud
he
that
is
unhappy
,
shall
be
unhappy
still
.
And
now
,
'O
-
all
ye
that
have
imagined
up
unto
yourselves
a
god
who
can
dono
miracles
,
I
would
ask
of
you
,
have
all'
these
things
past
,
of
which
J
have
spoken
?.
Has
the
end
come
yet
?
Behold'
say
unto
you
,
nay
;
and
God
has
not
ceased
to
be
a
God
of
miracles
.
De

,
are
not
(
he
things
that
God
hath
wrought

velous
in
our
eyes
?
Ven
:
and
who
can
comprehend
the
marvelous
works
.
of
God
?
Whoshall
say
that
-
it
was
nota
miracle
,
that
by
his
word
the
heaven
and
the
earth
should
be
;
and
by
the
power
of
his
word
,
man
was
created
of
the
dust
of
the
earth
;
and
by
tie
power'of
his
word
,
hath
miracl
:
s
been
wrought
?
And
who
shall
say
that
Jesus
Christ
did
not
do
many
mighty
miracles
?
And
there
were
many
.
mighty
suritacles
wrought
by
thehands
of
the
apostles
.
And'if
there
were
miracles
wrought
,
then
why
has'God
ceased
-
to
bea
God
of
miractes
,
and
yet
be
an
unchangable
being
.
And
behold
I'say
unto
you
,
he
changeth
not
;
if
80
,
he
would
cease
to
be
God
;
and
hie
ceaseth
-
not
to
be
God
,
and
is
a
God
-
of
miracleg
.
'
:
And
the
reason
why
he
ceaseth
to
.
do
miracles
among
the
children
of
men
,
is
:
because
that
they
-
dwindle
im
unbelief
,
and
depart
from
the
right
way
,
and
know
not
the
God
in
whom
they
should
trust

Beliold
[say
unto

that
whoso'

that

'
proceed
to
give
an
account
of
those
.
ancient
inhabitants
who
were
destroyed
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
upon
the
face
ofthis
north
country
.
And
.
I
take
mine
account
from
the
twenty
and
fou
plates
which
were
found
by
the
people
of
Limhi
,
which
is
called
the
book
of
Ether
.
And
as
I
suppose
that
the
first
.
part
of
this
record
,
which
speaks
.
concerning
the
creation
of
the
world
,
and
also
.
of
Adam
,
and
an
account
from
that
time
even
to
the
great
tower
,
and
whatsoever
things
transpired
among
the
children
of
men
until
that
time
,
is
had
among
the
Jews
,
therefore
I
do
not
write
those
things
which
transpired
from
the
days
of
Adam
until
that
time
;
but
they
are
had
upon
the
plates
;
and
whoso
findeth
them
,
the
same
will
have
power
that
he
may
get
the
full
account
.
But
behold
,
I
give
not
the
full
account
,
but
a
part
of
the
account
give
,
from
the
:
tower
down
until
they
were
destroyed
.

came
forth
with
his
brother
and
their
families
,
with
some
others
and
their
families
,
from
the
great
tower
,
at
the
time
the
Lord
confounded
the
language
of
the
people
,
and
swear
in
-
his
wrath
.
that
they
should
be
scattered
upon
all
the
face
.
of
the
earth
;
and
according
to
the
word
of
the
Lord
the
people
were
scattered
.
And
the
brother
of
Jared
,
being
a
large
and
a
mighty
man
,
and
being
a
man
highly
favored
of
the
Lord
:
for
Jared
his
brother
said
unto
him
,
ery
unto
the
Lord
,
that
he
will
not
confound
us
that
we
may
not
understand
our
words

And

pass
that
the
brother
of
{Jared
did
ery
unto
the
Lord
,
and
the
Lord
had
compassion
upon
Jared
;
therefore
he
did
not
confound
the
language
of
Jated
;
and
Jared
and
his
brother
were
not
confounded

Then
Jared
said
unto
his
brother
,
cry
again
unto
the
Lord
,
and
it
may
be
that
he
will
turn
away
his
anger
from
them

wno

are
our
friends
,
that
he
confound
not
their

And
it
came
to
pass
that
the

did
cry
unto
the
Lord
,
and
the
Lord
had
compassion
upon
their
friends
,
and
-
their
families
also
,
that
they
were
not
confounded

And
-
it
came
to
pass
that
Jared
.
spake
again
unto
his

,
saying
,
go
and
inguire
of
the
Lord
:
whether
he
will
drive
us
out
of

Jand
,

if
he
will
drive
us
out
of
the
land
,
ery
unto
him

whither
we
shall
go

And
who
knoweth

.
the
Lord
will
carry
us
forth
into
a
land
whichis
choice
above
all
the
earth
.
Andif
it
so'be
,
let
-
us
be
faithful
unto
the
Lord
,
that
we
may
receive
it
for
our
inheritance
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
Jared
did
ery
unto
the
Lord
according
to
that
which
had
been
spoken
by
.
the
mouth
of
Jared
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
hear
the
brother
of
Jared
,
and
had
compassion
upon
him
,
and
said
unto
him
,
go
to
and
gather
-
together
thy
flocks
,
both
male

female
,
of

And
when
thou
hast
done
this
,
thou
shalt
go
at
the
head
of
them
down
into
.
the
valley
,
which
is
northward
.
And
there'
will
.
J
meet
:
thee
,
and
I
will
go
before
thee
into
a
land
which
is
choice
above
-
all
.
the
land
of
the
earth
...
And
there
will
I
bless
thee'and
thy
seed
,
and
raise
up
unto
[File:568]
me

thy
.
seed
,
and
of
the
seed
of
thy
brother
,
and
they
who
shall
.
go
with
thee
,
a
-
great
nation
.
And
there
shall
.
be
none
greater
than
the
nation
which
I
will
raise
up
unto
me
of
thy
seed
,
upon
all
the
face
of
the
earth
.
And
thus
I
will
do
unto
thee
because
this
long
time
ye
have
cried
unto
me
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Jared
,
and
his
brother
,
and
their
families
,
and
also
the
friends
of
Jared
and
his
brother
,
and
their
families
,
went
down
into
the
valley
which
was
northward
,
(
and
the
name
of
the
valley
was
Nimrod
,
being
called
after
the
mighty
hunter
,)
with
their
flocks
which
they
had
gathered
together
,
male
and
female
,
of
every
kind
.
And
they
did
also
lay
snares
and
catch
fowls
of
the
air
,
and
they
did
also
prepare
a
vessel
,
in
which
they
did
carry
with
them
the
fish
of
the
waters
;
and
they
did
also
carry
with
them
deseret
,
which
,
by
interpretation
,
isa
honey
bee
;
and
thus
they
did
carry
with
them
swarms
of
bees
,
and
all
manner
of
that
which
was
.
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
seeds
of
every
kind
.
And
it'came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
come
down
into
the
-
valley
of
Nimrod
,
the
Lord
came
down
and
talked
with
the
brother
.
of
Jared
;
and
he
was
inacloud
,
and
the
brother
of
Jared
saw
him
not
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
commanded
them
that
they
should
go
forth
into
the
wilderness
,
yea
,
into
that
quarter
where
there
never
had
man
been
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
go
before
them
,
and
did
talk
with
them
as
he
stood
in
a
cloud
,
and
gave
directions
whither
they
should
travel
.
And
it
came
to
-
pass
that
they
did
travel
in
the
wilderness
,
and
did
build
barges
,
in
which
they
did
cross
many
waters
,
being
directed
continually
by
the
hand
of
the
Lord
.
And
the
Lord
would
not
:
suffer
that
they
should
stop
beyond
-
the
sea
in
the
wilderness
,
but
he
would
that
they
should
come
forth
even
unto
the
land
of
promise
,-
which
was
choice
above
all
other
lands
which
the
Lord
God
had
preserved
for'a
righteous
people
;
and
he
had
sworn
in
his
wrath
unto
the
brother
of
Jared
;
that
:
whogo
should
possess
this
land
of
promise
,
from
that
time
henceforth
and
forever
;
should
serve
him
,
the
true
and
.
only
God
,
or
they
should
be
swept
off
when
the
fulness
of
his
wrath'
should
come
upon
them
.
And
now
we
can
:
behold
the
decrees
of
God
concerning
this
land
,
that
it
is'a
land
of
promise
,
and
.
whatsoever
nation
shall
possess
it
,
shall
serve
God
,
or
they
-
shall
be
swept
off
when
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
shall
come
upon
them
.
And'
the
fulness
of
his
[File:569]
wrath
cometh
upon
them
when
they
are
ripened
in
iniquity
;
for
behold
,
this
is
aland
which
is
choice
above
all
other
lands
;
wherefore
he
that
doth
possess
it
shall
serve
God
,
or
shall
be
swept
off
;
for
it
is
the
everlasting
decree
of
God
.
Andit
is
not
until
the
fulness
of
iniquity
among
the
children
of
the
land
,
that
they
are
swept
off
.
And
this
cometh
unto
you
,
O
ye
Gentiles
,
that
ye
may
know
the
decrees
of
God
,
that
ye
may
repent
,
and
not
continue
in
your
iniquities
untl
the
fulness
come
,
that
ye
may
not
bring
down
the
fulness
of
the
wrath
of
God
upon
you
,
as
the
inhabit
ants
of
the
land
hath
hitherto
done
.
Behold
,
this'is
a
choice
land
,
and
whatsoever
nation
shall
possess
it
,
shall
be
free
from
bondage
,
and
from
captivity
,
and
from
all
other
nations
under
heaven
,
if
they
will
but
serve
the
God
of
the
land
,
who
is
Jesus
Christ
,
who
hath
been
manifested
by
the
things
which
we
have
written
.
And
now
I
proceed
with
my
record
;
for
behold
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
did
bring
Jared
and
his
brethren
forth
even
to
that
great
sea
which
divideth
the
lands
.
And
as
they
came
to
the
sea
,
they
pitched
their
tents
;
and
they
called
the
name
of
the
place
Moriancumer
;
and
they
dwelt
in
tents
:
and
dwelt
in
tents
upon
the
seashore
for
the
space
of
four
years
..
And
it
came
to
pass
at
the
end
of
four
years
,
that
the
Lord
came
again
unto
the
brother
of
Jared
,
and
stood
in
a
cloud
and
talked
with
him
.
And
for
the
space
of
three
hours
did
the
Lord
talk
with
the
brother
of
Jazed
,
and
chastened
him
because
he
remembered
not
to
call
upon
the
name
of'
the
Lord
.
And
the
brother
of
Jared
repented
of
the
evil
which
he
had
done
,
and
did
call
upon
the
name
of
the
Lord
for
his
brethren
who
were
with
him
.
And
the
Lord
said
unto
him
;-
I
will
forgive
thee
and
thy
brethren
of
their
sins
;
but
thou
shalt
not
sin
any
more
,
for
ye
shall
remember
that
my
spirit
will
not
always
strive
with
man
;
wherefore
if
ye
will'sin
until
ye
are
fully
ripe
,
ye
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
.
And
these
are
my
.
thoughts
upon
the
land
whichI
shall
give
you
for
your
inheritance
;
for
it
shall
be
a
land
choice
above
all
other
lands
.
And
the
Lord
said
,
goto
work
and
build
,
afterjthe
manner
of
barges
which
ye
.
have
hitherto
built
.
'
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
Jared
did
goto
:
work
,
and
also
his
brethren
,
and
built
barges
after
the
manner
which
.
they
had
built
,
according
:
to
the
instructions
of
the
Lord
.
And
they
:
were
smal}
,
and
they
were
light
upon
the
water
,
even
like
unto
the
[File:570]
lightness
of
.
a
fowl
upon
:
the
--
water
;
and
they
were
built
after
a
manner
.
that
they
were
.
exceeding
tight
,
even
that
they
,
would
hold
-
water
like
unto
-
a
dish
;
and
the
bottom
thereof
-
was
tight
like
un{o
a
dish
;
and
the
sides
:
thereof
were
tight
like
unto
a
dish
;
and
the
ends
thereof
were
peaked
;
and
the
.
top
thereof
was
tight
like
unto
a
dish
;
and
the
length
thereof
was
the
length
of
a
tree
;
and
the
door
thereof
,
when
it
was
shut
,
was
tight
like
unto
adish
.
And
it
cume
.
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
Jared
cried
unto
the
Lord
,
saying
,
O
Lord
I
have
performed
the
work
which
thou
hast
commanded
me
,
and
.
have
made
the
barges
according
as
thou
hast
directed
:
me
.
.
And
behold
,
O
Lord
,
in
them
there
is
.
no
light
,
whither
shall
we
steer
.
And
also
we
shall
perish
,
for
:
in
them
we
cannot
breathe
,
save
it
is
the
air
which
is
in
them
;
therefore
we
shall
perish
.
And
the
Lord
said
unto
the
brother
of
Jared
,
behold
,
thou
shalt
make
a
hole
.
in
the
top
thereof
,
and
also
in
the
bottom
thereof
;
and
when
thou
shalt
suffer
for
air
;
thou
shalt
.
unstop
the
hole
thereof
,
and
receive
air
..
And
if
itso
be
that
the
water
come
in
upon
thee
,
behold
,
ye
shall
stop
.
the
hole
thereof
,
that
ye
may
not
perish
.
in
the
flood
.
And
itcame
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
.
Jared
did
so
,
according
as
the
Lord
had
commanded
.
And
he
cried
again
unto
the
Lord
,
saying
;
O
Lord
,
behold
}
have
done
even
as
thou
hast
commanded
me
;
and
I
have
prepared
:
the
vessels
for
my
people
,
and
behold
,
there
is
no
lightin
them
.
Behold
,
O
Lord
;
wilt
thou
suffer
that
we
shall
cross
.
this
great
water
in
darkness
?
And
the
Lord
said
unto
the
brother
of
Jared
,
what
will
ye
that
J
should
do
that
ye
may
have
.
light
in
your
vessels
?
'
For
behold
,
ye
cannot
have
.
windows
,
for
they
will
be
dashed
in
pieces
;
neither
shall
ye
take
fire
with
you
,
for
ye
shall
not
go
by
the
light
of
fire
;
for
behold
,
ye
shall
be
as
a
whale
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
;
for
the
-
mountain
.
waves
shall
dash
upon
you
,
~
Nevertheless
,
I
will
bring
you
:
up
again
out
of
the
depths
of
the
sea
;:
for
the
winds
have
gone
forth
.
out
of
my
mouth
,
and
also
the
rains
and
the
floods
have
I
sent
forth
..
And
behold
,
I
prepare
You
against
these
things
;
for
howbeit
;
ye
cannot
cross
this'great
deep
,
save
I
prepare

against

,
and

have
gone

and

And
if
:
came
to
:
pass
that
the
brother
of
Jared
,
(
now
the
number
of
the
vessels
which
had
been
prepared
,
was'
eight
,)
went
forth
unto
the
mount
,
which
:
they
ealled
the
mount
Shelem
,
because
of
-
its
exceeding
height
,
and
did
moulten
.
out
of
a
rock
sixteen
small
stones
;
and
they
were
white
and
clear
,
even
as
transparent
glass
;
and
he
did
carry
them
.
in
his
hands
upon
the
top
of
the
mount
,
and
cried
again
unto
the
Lord
,
saying
,
O
Lord
,
thou
hast
said
that
we
must
be
encompassed
about
by
the
floods
.
Now
behold
,
O
Lord
,
and
do
not'be
angry
with
thy
servant
because
of
his
weakness
before
thee
;
for
we
know
that
thou
art
holy
,
and
dwellest
in
the
heavens
;
and
that
we
are
unworthy
before
thes
;
because
of'
the
fall
,
our
natures
have
become
evil
continually
;
nevertheless
,
O
Lord
,
thon
hast
given
us
a
commandment
that
we
must
call
upon
thee
,
that
from
thee
we
may
receive
according
to
our
desires
.
Behold
,
O
Lord
,
thou
hast
smitten
us
because
of
our
iniquity
,
and
hath
driven
us
forth
,
and
for
this
many
years
we
have
been
in
the
wilderness
;
nevertheless
;
thou
hast
been
merciful
unto
us
,
O
Lord
,
look
upon
me
ia
pity
,
and
turn
away
thine
anger
from
this
thy
peeple
,
and
suffer
not
that
they
shall
go
forth
across
this
raging
deep
in
darkness
,
but
:
behold
these
things
which
have
moulten
out
of
the
rock
.
Andd
know
,
O
(
Lord
,
that
thou
bast
all
power
,
and
can
do
whatsoever
thou
wilt
for
the
benefitjof
man
;
therefore
touch
these
stones
,
O
Lord
;
with
thy
finger
,
and
prepare
them
that
they
may
shine
forth
in
darkness
;
and
they
shall
shine
forth
unto
.
us
in
the
vessels
which
we
have
prepared
,
that
we
may'have
light
while
we
shall
eross
the
sea
.
Behold
,
O
Lord
,
thou
canst
do
.
this
.
We
know
that
thou
art
able
to
shew
forth
great
:
powet
,
which
looks
small
unto
the
understanding
of
men
.
And
it
came
to
-
pass
that
when
-
the
brother
of
Jared
had
said
these
words
,
behold
,
the
Lord
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
touched
the
stones
,
one
by
one
,
with
his
finger
;
and
the
vail
was
taken
from
off
the
eyes
of
the
brotherof
Jared
,
and
he
saw
the
finger
of
the
Lord
;
and
it
was
as
the
finger
of
a
man
,
like
unto
flesh
and
blood
;
and
the
brother
of
Jared
fell
down
before
the
Uord
,
for
he
was'struck
with
fear
.
And
:
the
Lord
saw
that
the
.
brother
of
Jared
had
fallen
to
the
earth
;
and
the
Lord
said
unto
him
,
arise
,
why
hast
thou
fallen
?
And
.
heysaith
unto
the
Lord
,
I
saw
the
.
finger
of
the
Lord
,
and
I
feared
lest
he
should
smite
me
;:
for
L
knew
not
that
the
Lord
had
flesh
and
blood
...
And'
the
Lord
[File:572]
said
unto'
him
,
.
because
of
.
thy
faith'
thou
hast
.
seen
that
.
I
shall
take
upon
me
flesh
and
.
blood
;
and
never
has
man
come
before
me
with
such
exceeding
faith
as
thou
.
hast
;
for
were
it
not
so
,
ye
could
not
have
seen
my
finger
.
Sawest
thou
nore
than
this
?
And
he
answered
,
nay
,
Lord
,
shew
thyself
unto
me
.
And
the
Lord
said
unto
him
,
believest
thou
the
words
which
I
shall
speak
?
And
he
answered
,
yea
,
Lord
,
I
know
that
thou
speakest
the
truth
,
forthou
art
a
God
of
truth
,
and
canst
not
lie
.
And
when
he
had
said
these
words
,
behold
,
the
Lord
shewed
himself
unto
him
,
and
said
,
because
thou
knowest
these
things
,
ye
are
-
redeemed
from
the
fall
;
therefore
ye
are
brought
back
into
my
presence
;
therefore
I
shew
myself
unto
you
.
Behold
,
I
am
he
who
was
prepared
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
to
redeem
my
people
.
Behold
,
Tam
Jesus
Christ
..
Jam
the
Father
and
the
Son
..
In
me
shall
all
mankind
have
light
,
and
that
eternally
,
even
they
who
shall
believe
on'
my
name
;
and
they
shall
become
my
sons
and
my
daughters
.
And
never
have
I
shewed
myself
unto
man
whom
I
have
created
,
for
never
has
man
believed
in
meas
thou
hast
.
Seest
thou
that
ye
are
created
aftermine
ownimage
?
Yea
,
even
all
men
were
created
in
the
beginning
,
after
mine
own
image
...
Behold
,
this
body
,
which
ye
now
behold
,
is
the
body
of
my
spirit
;
and
man
have
I
created
after
the
body
of
my
spirit
;
and
even
as
I
appear
.
unto
thee
to
in
the
spirit
,
will
appear
unto
my
people
in
the
flesh
.
;
y
And
now
,
as
I
Moroni
,
said
I
could
not
make
a
full
account
of
these
things
which
are
written
,
therefore
it
.
sufficeth
me
to
say
,
that
Jesus
shewed
himself
unto
this
man
in
the
spirit
,
even
after
the
manner
and
in
the
likeness
of
the
same
body
,
even
as
he
shewed
himself
unto
the
Nephites
;
and
he
ministered
unto
him
,
even
as
he
ministered
unto
the
Nephites
;
and
all
this
,
that
this
man
,
knew
that
he
was
God
,
because
of
the
many
-
great
works
which
the
Lord
had
shewed
unto
~
him
.
And
-
because
of
the
knowledge
of
this
man
,
-
he
could
not
be
kept
from
beholding
within
the
vail
;
and
he
saw
the
finger
of
Jesus
,
which
,
when
he
saw
,
he
fell
with
fear
;
for
he
knew
that
it
was
the
,
finger
of
the
:
Lord
;
andhe
:
had
faith
no
:
donger
,
-
for
he
knew
,
nothing
doubting
;
wherefore
;-
having
this
perfect
knowledge

And
it
came
to
pass'
that
the
Lord
said
unto
the
brother
of
Jared
,
behold
,
thou
shalt
not
suffer
these
things
which
ye
have
geen
and
heard
,
to
go
forth
unto
the
world
,
until
the
time
-
cometh
that
I
shall
glorify
my
name
in
the
flesh'
;
wherefore
,
ye
shall
treasure
up
the
things
which
ye
.
have
seen
and
heard
,
and
shew
it
to'
no
man
.
And
behold
,
when
ye
shall
come
unto
me
;
ye
shall
write
them
and
shall
seal
them
up
,
that
no
one
can
interpret
them
;
for
:
ye
shall
write
them
in
alanguage
that
they
cannot
be
read
.
And
behold
,
these
two
stones
will
I
give
unto
thee
,
and
ye
shall
seal
them
up
also
,
with
the
things
which
ye
shall
write
.
For
behold
,
the
language
which
ye
shall
write
,
[have
confounded
;
wherefore
I
will
cause
in
mine
own
due
time
that
these
stones
shall
magnify
to
the
eyes
of
men
,
these
things
which
ye
shall
write
.
And
when
the
Lord
had
said
these
words
,
he
shewed
unto
the
brother
of
Jared
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
which
had
been
,
and
also
all
that
would
be
;
and
he
withheld
them
not
from
his
sight
,
even
unto
the
ends
ofthe
earth
;
for
he
had
gaid
unto
him
in
times
before
,
that
-
if
he
would
believe
in
him
,
that
he
could
shew
unto
him
all
things
.
it
should
be
shewn
unto
him
;
therefore
the
Lord
could
not
withhold
any
thing
from
him
;
for
he
knew
that
the
Lord
could
shew
him
all
things
.
And
the
Lord
said
unto
him
,
write
these
things
and
seal
them
up
,
and
I
will
shew
them
in
mine
own
due
time
unto
the
children
of
men
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
commanded
him
that
he
should
seal
up
the
two
stones
which
he
had
received
,
and
shew
them
not
,
until
the
Lord
should
shew
them
unto
the
children
of
men
.
And
the
Lord
commanded
the
brother
of
Jared
to
go
down
out
of
the
mount
from
the
presence
of
the
Lord
,
and
write
the
things
which
he
had
seen
;
and
they
were
forbidden
to
:;
come
unto
the
children
of
men
,
until
after
that
he
should
be
lifted
up
upon
the
cross
;
and
for
this
cause
did
king
Benjamin
keep
them
,
that
they
should
not
come
unto
the
world
until
atter
Christ
shouldshew
himself
unto
his
people
.
And
after
Christ
truly
had
shewed
himself
unto
his
people
,
he
commanded
that
they
should
-
be
made
manifest
.
And
now
,
after
that
,
they
have
all
dwindled
in
unbelief
:
and
there
is
none
,
save
it
.
be'the
Lamanites
,
andthey
have
rejected
the
gospel
of
Christ
;
therefore
Tam
commanded
that
T
should
:
hide
them
up'again
in'
the'
earth
.
Behold
,
I
have
written
upon
these
plates
the
very
things
which
[File:574]
the
:
brother
.
of
Jared
:
saw
;
there
never
was
greater
things
made
manifest
;
than
that
.
which
.
was
made
manlfest
,
unto
the
brother
of
Jared
;
wherefore
,
the
Lord
hath
commanded
me
to
write
them
;
and
I
have
written
them
,
~And
he
commanded
me
that
I
should
seal
them
up
;
and
he
also
hath
commanded
that
I
should
seal
up
the
interpretation
.
thereof
;
wherefore
I
have
sealed
up
the
interpreters
,
according
to
the
commandment
of
the
Lord
.
For
the
Lord
said
unto
.
me
,
they
shall
not
go
forth
unto
the
Gentiles
until
the
day
that
they
shall
repent
of
.
their
iniquity
,
and
.
become
clean
before
the
Lord
;
and
in
that
day
that
they
shall
exercise
faith
in
me
,
saith
the
Lord
,
even
as
the
brother
of
Jared
did
,
that
they
,
may
become
sanctified
in
me
,
then
.
will
I
.
manifest
unto
them
the
things
which
the
brother
of
Jared
saw
,
even
to
the
unfolding
unto
them
all
my
revelations
;
saith
Jesus
Christ
,
the
Son
of
God
,
the
Father
of
the
heavens
and
of
the
earth
,
and
all
things
,
that
in
them
are
.
And
he
that
will
contend
against
the
word
.
of
the
Lord
,
let
him
be
accursed
;
and
he
that
shall
deny
these
things
,
let
him
be
accursed
;
for
unto
them
will
I
.
shew
no
greater
things
,
saith
Jesus
Christ
,
for

and
at

the

thereof
shall
pass
away
,
even
so
as
by
fire
;
and
he
that
believeth
not
my
words
,
beleiveth
not
my
disciples
;
and
if
it
so
be
that
I
do

judge
ye
;
for

know

For

CHAPTER
IIL
.
Ann
.
now
I
,.
Moroni
,
proceed
to
give
the
record
of
Jared
and
his
brother
.
For
it
came
to
pass
afler
the
Lord
had
prepared
the
stones
which
the
brother
of
Jared
had
carried
up
into
the
mount
,.
the
brother
of
Jared
came
down
out
of
the
mount
,
and
he
did
put
forth
the
stenes
into
the
vessels
which
were
prepared
,
one
in
each
end
thereof
;
and
behold
,
they
did
give
light
unto
the
vessels
:
thereof
,
And
thus
the
Lord
caused
stones
to
,
shine
,
in
darkness
,
to
give
light
unto
men
,
women
and
children
,
that
they
might
not
cross
,
the
great
waters
in
darkness
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
prepared
all
manner
of
food
,
that
therehy
they
might
subsist
upon
the
water
,
and
also
food
for
their
flocks
and
herds
,
and
whatsoever
.
beast
,
or
animal
,
or
fowl
that
they
should
carry
with
them
...
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
done
all
these
things
,
they
got
aboard
of
their
vessels
or
barges
,
and
set
forth
into
the
sea
,
commending
themselves
unto
the
Lord
their
God
..
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
the
Lord
God
caused
that
there
should
a
furious
wind
blow
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
,
towards
the
promised
land
;
and
thus
they
were
tossed
upon
the
waves
ofthe
sea
before
the
wind
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
were
many
times
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
,
because
of
the
mountain
waves
which
broke
upon
them
,
and
also
the
great
and
terrible
tempests
which
were
caused
by
the
fierceness
of

_
And
it
came
to
pass
.
that
when
they
were
buried
in
re
.
wasno
water
that
.
could
.
burt
them
,
ls
being
tight
like
unto
adish
,
and
also
they'
[File:577]
were
tight
like
unto
the
ark
of
Noah
;
therefore
when
they
were
encompassed
about
by
many
waters
,
they
did
ery
unto
the
Lord
and
he
did
bring
them
forth
again'
upon
the
top
of
the
waters
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
wind
did
never
cease
to
blow
towards
the
promised
land
,
while
they
were
upon
the
waters
;
and
thus
they
were
driven
forth
before
the
wind
;
and
they
did
sing
praises
unto
the
Lord
;
yea
,
the
brother
of
Jared
did
sing
praises
unto
the
Lord
,
and
he
did'
thank
and
praise
the
Lord
all
the
day
long
;
and
when
the
night
came
,
they
did
not
cease
to
praise
the
Lord
.
And
thus
they
were
driven
forth
;
and
no
monster
of
the
sea
could
break
them
,
neither
whale
that
could
mar
them
;
and
they
did
have
light
continually
,
whether
it
was
above
the
water
or
under
the
water
.
And
thus
they
were
driven
torth
,
three
hundred
and
forty
and
four
days
upon
the
water
;
and
they
did
land
up
on
the
shore
of
the
promised
land
.
And
when
they
had
set
their
feet
upon
the
shores
of
the
promised
land
,
they
bowed
themselves
down
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
did
humble
themselves
before
the
Lord
,
and
did
shed
tears
of
joy
before
the
Lord
,
because
of
the
multitude
of
his
tender
mercies
over
them
.
_
-
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
went
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
began
to
till
the
earth
.
And
Ja
redhad
four
sons
;
and
they
.
were
called
Jacom
,
and
Gilgah
,
and
Mahah
,
and
Orihah
.
And
the
brother
of
Jared
also
begatsons
and
daughters
.
And
the
friends
of
Jared
and
his
brother
;
were
in
number
about
twen
ty
and
two
souls
;
and
they
also
begat
sons
and
daugh
ters
,
before
they
came
to
the
promised
land
;
and
there
fore
they
began
to
be
many
.
And
they
were
taught
to
walk
hambly
before
the
Lord
;
and
they
were
also
taught
from
on
high
.
And
it'came
to
pass
that
they
began
to
spread
upon
the'
face
of
the
land
,
and
to
multiply
and
to
till
the
earth
;
and
they
did
wax
strong
in
the
land
.
And
the
brother
of
Jared
began
to
be
old
,
and
saw
that
he
must
soon
go
down
to
the
grave
;
wherefore
he
said
unto
Jared
,
let
us
:
gather
together
our
people
that
we
may
number
them
,
that
we
may
know
of
them
what
they
:
will
desire
of
us
before
we
go
down
to
our
graves
.
.
And'
accordingly
the
.
people
were
gathered
together
.
Now
the
number
of
the
sons
and
the
daughters
of
the
brother
of
Jared
were'
twenty
and
two'souls
;
and
the
_fumberof
the'sons
and
daughters
of
Jared
were
twelve
,
he
having
four
sons
.
Â©
And
itcame
to
pass
that
they
[File:578]
'
did
number
-
their
people
;
aud
.
after
that
they
badnumbered
them
,
they
did
desire
,
of
them
the
:-
tbings
which
they
:
would
that

they
should

do
before

down
.
to

graves
,,
And
it
.
came
to
pass
that

the

people
desired
of
.
them
that
they
should

one
of

And
-
now
behold
,
this
Was

grievous
unto
them

But
the

brother

of

Jared
said

And

exceeding
,
old
;
nevertheless
Kib
sbegat
Shule
in
his
old
age
,
while
he
was

yet
in
captivity
.
And
it
eame
;
to

that
Shule
was
angry
with

;-
and
Shule
waxed
strong
,
and
became
mighty
,
as
:
'to
{he
strength
of
a
man
;
and
he
was
also
mighty
in

.
Wherefore
he
came
to

,
and
:
hedid
moulten
out

hill
,
and
made
swords
out
of

he
returned

and
gave
battle
unto
his

,
by
which
-
means
he
obtained
the
kingdom
,
And
-
restoredit
unto
his
father
Kib
,
.
And
now
because
of
the
thing
which
Shule
had
done
,
his
father
bestow
-
.
ed
upon
him
the
kingdom
;
therefore
he
began
to
reign
inthe
stead
of
-
his
father
.
And
it
came
.
to
pass
that
he
:
did
execute
judgment
in
righteousness
;
and
he
did
spread
his
kingdom
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
,.
for
the

people

:
become
exceeding
numerous
.
And
it
came
to

that
Shule
also
begat
many
sons
.
and
daughters
.
And
Corihor
repented
of
the
many
evils
which
he
:
lad
-
done
;
wherefore
Shule
gave
him
power
in
his
kingdom
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Corihor
had
many
sons
and
daughters
.
And
.
among
the
sons
.
of
Corihor
there
was
one
whose
name
was
Noah
.
And
it
came
.
to
-
pass
that
Neah
rebelled
against
Shule
,
the
king
,
and
also
his
father
Corihor
,
and
drew
away
:
Cohor
his
brother
,
and
-
also
all
his
brethren
and
.
.
many
of
the
people
.
And
he
gave
battle
unto
Shule
,
the
:
king
,
in
which
he
did
obtain
the
land
of
their
first
inheritance
;
and
he
became
.
a
king
over
that
part
.
of
.
the
land
.
Andit
came
to
pass
that
he
gave
:
battle
again
unto
Shule
the
:
king
;
and
he
took
Shule
the
king
;
and
carried
him
away
captive
into
Moron
.
And
it
:
came
to
pass
as
hevwas
about
to
put
him
to
death
,
the
sens
of
Shule
crept
.
into
the
house
of
Noah
by
night
and
slew
.
him
,
and
broke
down
the
door
of
the
prisonand
brought
out
their
father
,
and
,
placed
him
upon
his
throne
in
his
own
kingdom
;
wherefore
the
son
of
Noah
did
build
up
his
kingdom
in
.
his
stead
;
nevertheless
they
.
did
not
gain
power
any
more
over
Shule
the
king
:
sand
the
people
who
.
were
under
the
reigniof
:
Shule
the
king
,
did
.
prosper
exceedingly
and
Wax
great
.,
And
the
country
was
divided
;
and
:
thero
were
:
two
kingdoms
,
the
kingdom
of
Shule
,
and
the
[File:580]
kingdom
of
Cohor
,
the
son
of
Noah
.
And
Cohor
,
the
son
of
Noah
,
caused
that
his
people
should
give
battle
unto
Shule
,
in
which
Shule
did
beat
them
,
and
did
sey
Cohor
:
.
And
now
Cohor
had
ason
who
was
called
Nimrod
;
and
Nimrod
.
gave
up
the
kingdom
of
Cohor
unto
Shule
,
and
he
did
gain
favor
in
the
eyes
of
Shule
;
wherefore
Shule
did
bestow
great
favors
upon
him
,
and
he
,
did
do
in
the
kingdom
of
Shule
aceording
to
his
desires
;
and
also
in
the'
reign
of
Shule
there
came
prophets
among
the
people
,
whe
were
sent
from
the
Lord
,
prophesying
that
the
wickedness
and
adolatry
of
the
people
was
bringing
a
curse
upon
the
land
,
and
they
should
be
destroyed
,
if
they
did
not
repent
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
did
revile
against
the
prophets
,
and
did
mock
:
them
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
king
Shule
did
execute
judgment
against
all
those
who
did
revile
against
the
prophets
;
and
he
did
execute
a
law
throughout
all
the
land
,
which
gave
power
unto
the
prophets
that
they
should
go
whithersoever
they
would
;
and
by
ihis
cause
the
people
were
brought
unto
repentance
.
And
because
the
people
did
repent
of
their
imiquities
and
idolatries
,
the
Lord
did
spare
them
,
and
they
began
to
prosper
again
in
the
land
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Shule
begat
sons
.
and
daughters
in
his
old
age
..
And
there
were
no
more
wars
in
the
days
of
Shule
;
and
he
remembered
the
great
ee
the
Lord
.
had
done
for
his
fathers
in
bringing
them
across
tlie
great
deep
into
the
promised
land
;
'
wherefore
he
.
did
execute
judgment
in
righteousness
all
his
days
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
begat
Omer
,
and
Omer
reigned
inhis
stead
.
And
Omer
begat
Jared
;
and
Jared
begat
-
sons
and
daughters
.
And
Jared
rebelled
against
his
father
,
and'came
and
dwelt
!
in
the
land
ot
Heth
.
And
it
came
:
to
.
pass
that
he
-
did
flatter
many
people
,
because
of
his
cunning
words
;
until
he
had
gained
the
half
of
the
kingdom
.
And
when
he
had
-
gained
the
half
of
the
kingdom
,
he
gave
battle
unto
bis
father
;
and'he
did
arry
away
his
father
into
cap
:
tivity
,
and
did
make'
him
serve
in
captivity
..
And
now
in
the
days
of
the
reign
of
:
Omer
,
he
was
in
-
captivity
the
half
of
his
days
.
And
it
came
to
pass
:
that
he'
begat
sons'
and
daughters
,
among
whom
were
Esrom
and
Coriantumr
;
and
:
they
:
were
exceeding
angry
because'
of
the
doings
of
Jared
their
brother
,
insomuch
that
they
did
raise
an
army
,:
and
gave
battle
unto
Ja
[File:581]
red
..
And
it
came
-
to
,
pass
that
they
did
give
battle
unto
him
by
night
.
And
it
came
te
pass
that
.
when
they
.
had
slain
the
army
of
Jared
,
they
were
about
to
slay
,
him
.
also
;
and
he
plead
with
them
that
they
would
not
slay
him
,
and
he
would
give
up
the
kingdom
unto
his
father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
did
grant
unto
him
his
life
.
And
now
Jared
became
exceeding
sorrowful
because
of
the
loss
of
the
kingdom
,
for
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
the
kingdom
,
and
upon
the
.
glory
of
the
world
.
Now
the
daughter
of
Jared
being
exceeding
expert
,
and
seeing
the
sorrows
of
her
father
,
thought
to
devise
a
plan
whereby
she
could
.
redeem
.
the
kingdom
unto
her
father
.
Now
the
daughter
of
Jared
was
exceeding
fair
.
And
it
came
.
to
pass
that
.
she
did
talk
with
her
father
,
and
said
unto
him
,
whereby
bath
my
father
so
much
sorrow
?
Hath
he
not
.
read
the
record
which
our
fathers
brought
across
the
great
deep
?
Belold
,
is
there
not
an
account
concerning
them
of
old
,
that
they
by
their
secret
plang
did
obtain
kingdoms
and
great
glory
?
And
-
now
therefore
,
letamy
father
send
for
Akish
,
the'son
of
Kimnor
;
and
behold
,
[
am
.
fair
,
and
I
will
dance
before
.
him
,
and
I
will
please
him
,
that
he
will
desire
me
to
wife
;
wherefore
if
he
shall
.
desire
of
thee
that
ye
shall
give
unto
him
me
to
wife
,
then
shall
ye
say
,
I
will
give
her
if
ye
will
bring
unto
me
the
head
of
my
father
,
the
king
..
And
now
Omer
was
a
friend
to
Akish
,
wherefore
when
Jared
had
sent
for
Akish
,
the
daughter
.
of
Jared
danced
before
him
,
that
she
pleased
him
,
insomuch
that
he
desired
her
to
wife
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
said
unto
Jared
,
give
her
unto
me
to
wife
.
And
Jared
said
unte'
him
,
I
will
give
her
unto
you
,
if
ye
will
bring
unto
.
me
the
head
of
my
father
,
the
king
.
And
it
came
.
to
pass
that
Akish
gathered
in
unto
the
house
of
Jared
all
his
kinsfolks
,
and
said
unto
them
,
will
-
ye
Swear
unto
me
that
ye
will
be
faithful
unto
me
in
the
thing
which
I
shall
desire
of
you
?
And
it
came
-
to
pass
.
that
they
all
sware
unto
him
,
by
the
God
of
heayen
,.
and
also
by
the
heavens
,
and
also
by
the
earth
,
and
by
.
their
.
heads
,
that
whoso
should
vary
from
the
assistance
,
which
.
Akish
desired
,
should
lose
his
head
;
and
whogo
.
should
divulge
whatsoever
thing
Akish
.
made
known
unto
.
them
,
fine
same
should
lose
his
life
.
And
it
-
came
to
.
pass
that
thus
they
did
agree
with
Akish
.
And
:
Akish
did
administer
unto
them
the
oaths
which
were
.
given
by
.
them
,
of
..
old
,
who
also
.
sought
power
,
which
had
.
been
.
handed
.
down
even
.
from
Cain
;
.
who
[File:582]
was
a
murderer
from
the
beginning
.
â
And
they
were
kept
up
by
the
power
of
the
devil
to
administer
these
oaths
unto
the
people
,-
to
keep
them
in
darkness
,
to
help
such
as
sought
power
,
to
gain
power
,
and
to
mur
.
der
,
and'
to
:
plunder
,
and
to
lie
,
and
to
commit
all
manner
of
wickedness
and
whoredoms
.
And
it
was
the
daughter
of
Jared
who'put
it
into
his
heart
to
search
up
these
things
of
old
;
and
Jared
put
it
-
into
the
heart
of
Akish
:
wherefore
Akish
administered
.
it
unto'his
kindreds
and
triends
,
leading
them
away
by
fair
promises
to
do
whatsoever
thing
he
desired
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
formed
a'secret
-
combination
,
even
as
they
of
old
;
which
combination
is
most
abominable
and
wicked
above
all
,
in
.
the
sight
of
God
;
for
the
Lord
worketh
not
in
secret
combinations
,
neither
doth
he
will
that
man
should
shed
blood
,
but
in
all
things
hath
forbidden
it
,
from
-
the
beginning
-
of
man
:
And
now
I
,
Moroni
,
do
not
write
the
manner
of
their
oaths
and
combinations
,
for
it
hath
been
made
known
unto
me
that
they
arehad
among
all
people
,
'and
they
are
had
among
the
Lamanites
,
and
they
have
caused
the
destruction
of
this
people
of
whom

am
now
rpeaking

also
the
destruction

to

;
until
they
shall
spread
over

they
shall
be
destroyed
,
for
the
Lord
will
not

shall

ery
unto

from

ground
for

upon

and
:
yet
he
avenge

not
;
wherefore
,
O
ye
Gentiles
;
it
is
wisdom
in
God
that
these
things
should
be
shewn
unto
you
;
that'thereby
ye
may
repent
of
your
sins
,
and
suffer
:
not
that'

which
arebuilt

and
the
work

even

shall
fall

to

CHAPTER

Axp
now

,
Moroni
,
proceed
with
my
record
..
Therefore
behold
,
it
cathe
to
pass
that
hecause
of
the
secret
combinations
of
Akish
and
his
friends
,
beliold
they
did
overthrow
the
kingdom
of
Omer
;
nevertheless
,
the
Lord
was
shaven
unto
Omer
,
and
also
to
his
sons
and
to
his
daughters
,
who
did
not
seek
his
destruction
.
And
the
Lord
warned
Omer
in
a
dream
that
he
should
depart
out
of
the
land
;
wherefore
Omer
departed
out
of
the
Jand
with
his
family
,
and
traveled
many
days
,
and
came
over
and
passed
by
the
hill
of
Shim
,
and
came
over
bythe
place
where
the
Nephites
were
destroyed
,
and
from
thence
eastward
,
and
came
to'a
place
which
was
called
Ablom
,
by
the
seashore
,
and
there
he'pitched
his
tent
,
and
also
his
sons
and
his
daughters
,
and
all
his
household
,
save
it
were
Jared
and
his
family
.
oi
And
it~
came
to
pass
that
Jared
was
ariointed
king
over
the
people
,
by
the
hand
of
wickedness
;
and
he
gave
urite
Akish'his
daughter
to
wife
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Akish
sought
the
life
of
his
father
-
in
-
law
;
and
he
applied
unto
those
whom
he
had
sworn
by
the
Oath
of
the
ancients
,
and
they
obtained
the
head
of
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
as
he
sat
upon
his
throne
,
giving
audience
to
his
people
;
for'so
great
had
been
the
spreading
of
this
wicked
and
secret
society
,
that
it
had
eor
:
ropted
:
the
hearts
of
all
the'
people
;
therefore
Jared
[File:584]
was
murdered
upon
his
throne
,
and
Akish
reigned
in
his
stead
.
And
it
came
{o
.
pass
that
Akish
began
-
to
be
.
jealous
of
his
.
son
,
therefore
he
shut
him
up
in
prison
,
and
kept
him
upon
little
or
.
no
food
,
until
he
.
had
suffered
:
death
..
And
now
the
brother
,
of
him
that
suf
fered
death
,
(
and
-
his
,
name
was
Nimrah
,)
was
angry
with
his
father
,
because
.
of
that
which
his
father
had
done
unto
his
brother
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Nimrah
gathered
together
a
small
number
of
men
,
and
fled
out
of
the
land
,
and
.
came
-
over
and
dwelt
with
Omer
,
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Akish
begat
other
sons
,
and
they
won
the
.
hearts
of
the
people
,
notwithstanding
they
-
had
sworn
unto
him
to
do
.
all
manner
of
iniquity
,
according
to
that
which
he
desired
.
Now
.
the
people
of
Akish
were
desirous
for
gain
,
even
as
Akish
was
desirous
for
power
;
wherefore
the
sons
of
Akish
did
offer
them
money
,
by
which
means
they
drew
away
the
more
part
of
the
people
after
them
;
and
there
began
to
be
a
war
between
the
sons
of
Akish
and
Akish
,
which
lasted
for
the
space
of
many
years
;
yea
,
unto
the
destruction
of
nearly
all
the
people
of
the
kingdom
;
yea
,
even
all
,
save
it
were
.
thirty
soulsyand
they
who
fled
with
the
house
,
of
Omer
;
wherefore
Omer
was
restored
again
to
the
land
of
his
inheritance
.
Andit
came
to
pass
that
Omer
began
to
be
old
,
nevertheless
,
in
his
old
.
age
he
begat
Emer
;
and
he
anointed
Emer
to
be
king
.
to
reign
inhis
stead
.
And
after
that
he
had
.
anointed
Emer
to
be
.
king
,
he
.
saw
peace
in
the
land
for
.
the
.
space
of
two
years
,
and
.
he
died
,
having
seen
-
exceeding
many
days
,
which
were
full
of
sorrow
.
And
it
-
came
to
.
pass
that
Emer
did
reign
in
his
stead
,
and
did
fill
the
steps
of
his
father
.
.
And
the
Lord
begap
again
to
take
the
curse
from
off
.
the
land
,
and
the
house
of
Emer
did
prosper
exceedingly
under
the
reign
of
Emer
;
and
.
in
the
space
of
.
sixty
and
two
Years
,
they
had
become
exceeding
strong
,
insomuch
that
they
became
exceeding
rich
,
having
all
manner
of
fruit
,
and
of
gin
and
of
silks
,
and
of
fine
linen
,
and
of
gold
,
and'
of
silver
,
and
of
precious
things
,
and
also
all
manner
.
of
cattle
,
of
:
oxen
,
and
cows
,
and
of
sheep
,
and
of
swine
,
and
of
goats
,
and
also
many
other
kind
of
animals
which
.
were
useful
for
,
the
food
.
of
man
;
and
they
also
had
horses
,
and
.
asses
,
and
there
were
elephants
,
and
.
cureloms
,
and
cumoms
:
all
of
which
were
useful
unto
man
,
and
more
:
especially
the
elephants
,
and
cureloms
;
and
:
cumoms
,,,
And
thus
the
Lord
.
did
pour
out
his
blessings
.
upon
.
this
land
,
which
was
.
choice
abore
[File:585]
all
other
lands
;
and
he
commanded
that
whoso
should
possess
the
land
,
should
possess
it
unto'
the
Lord
,
or
they
,
should
be
destroyed
when
:
they
were
ripened
-
in'
iniquity
;
for
upon
such
,
saith
the
Loa
,
I
will
pour
out
the
fulness
of
my
wrath
.
And
Emer
did
execute
judgment
in
righteousness
,
all
his
days
,
and
he
begat
many
sons
and
daughters
;
and
he
begat
Coriantum
;
and
he
anointed
Coriantum
to
reign
in
his
stead
.
And
after
he
had
anointed
Coriantum
to
reign
in
his
stead
,
he
lived
four
years
,
and
he
saw
peace
in
the
land
;
yea
,
and
he
even
saw
the
Son
of
righteousness
,
and
did
rejoice
and
glory
in
his
day
;
and
he
died'in
peace
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Coriantum
did
walk
in
the
steps
of
his
father
,
and
did
build
many
mighty
cities
,
and
did
administer
that
which
was
:-
good
unto
his
people
,
in
all
bis
days
.
And
it
.
came
to
pess
that
he
had
no
children
,
even
until
he
was
exceeding
old
.
And
it
.
came
to
pass
that
his
wife
died
,
being
an
hundred
and
two
years
old
.
And
it
came
-
to
pass
that
Coriantum
took
to
.
wife
,
in
his
old
age
,
a
young
maid
,
and
begat
sons
and
daughters
;
wherefore
he
lived
until
he
was
an
hundred
and
forty
and
two
years
old
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
.
he
begat
Com
,
and
Com
reigned
in
his
stead
;
and
he
reigned
forty
and
nine
years
,
and
:
he
begat
Heth
;
and
he
also
begat
other
sons
and
daugh

ters
;
And
the
people
-
had
spread
again
overall
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
there
began
again
to
be
an
ex

ceeding
great
wickedness
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
Heth
began
to
embrace
the
secret
plans
again
of
old
,
to
destroy
his
father
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
he
did
dethrone
his
father
;
for
he
slew
him
with
his
own
sword
;
and
he
did
reign
in
bis
stead
.
And
there
came
prophets
inthe
hind
again
,
crying
repentance
unto'
them
;
that
:
they
must
prepare
the
:
way
of

the
Lord
,
or
there
should
come
a
curse
upon

land
;.
yea
,
even
there
should
bea
great
famine
,
in
Which
they
should
be
destroyed
,
if
they
did
not
-
repent
.
But
the
people
believed
not
the
words
of
:
the
prophets
,
but
.
they
cast
them
out
;
and
some
of
them
they
.
cast
-
into
pits
,
and
left
them
to
perish
.
.
And
it
came
to'
pass
that
they
done
all
these
things
according
to
the
:
conmandment
of
the
king
Heth
.
And
it
came
.
to'paes
that
there
began
to
bea
great
dearth
upon

land
,
and
the
inhabitants
began
to
be

fast
,
because
of

for

Upon

;
and
there
came

was

And

it
came

there

,
that
the

;
that
whoso
should
attempt
to

,
might
fall
by

And
it
came
to

that
the

did
follow

of

and
did
devour
the

Now
when
the
people
ww

that
they
must
perish
,
they
began
to
repent
of
their
iniquities
,
and
cry
unto
the
Lord
.
.
And
it
came
ss
that
when
they
had
humbled
themselves
sufficiently
before

did
remember
the
destruction
of

,
and
-
he
did
build
up

,
for

And
it
came

that
he
did
afflict

people
with

abominations
;
and
when

he
had

the

insomueh
that

And
it
came
to

,
after

years
,
Morianton
,:
(
he
being
a
descendant
of
Riplakish
,)
gathered
together
an
army
of
outcasts
,
and
went
forth
and
gave

unto

;
and
he
gained

and
the

And
he
did
do
justice

And

CHAPTER

Anp
it
came
to

that
the
days
of

were
in

days
of

;
and
Coriantumr
was
king
oyer
all
the
land
.
And
Ether
was'a
prophet
of
the
Lord
;
wherefore
Ether
came
-.
forth
in
the
days
of
Corianiumr
,
and
began
to
prophesy
unto
the
people
,
for
he
could
not
be
restrained
because
ofthe
spirit
of
the
Lord
which
was
in
.
him
;
for
he
did
ery
from
the
morning
,
even
.
until
the
going
down
of
the
sun
,
exhorting
the
people
to
,
believe
in
-
God
unto
repentance
,
lest
they
should
be
.
destroyed
,
saying
unto
them
,
that
by
faith
all
things
are
fulfilled
;
wherefore
,
whoso
believeth
in
God
,
might
with
surety
hope'
for
a
better
world
,
yea
,
even
a
place
at
the
right
hand
of
God
,
which
hope
cometh
of
faith
,
maketh
an
anchor
to
the
souls
of
men
,
which
would
make
them
sure
and
steadfast
,
always
abounding
in
good
works
,
being
led
to
glotify
God
.,
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
Ether
did
prophesy
great
.
and
marvelous
things
unto
the
people
,
which
they
did
not
believe
,
because
they
saw
them
not
.
.
And
now
.
I
,
Moroni
,
would
.
speak
somewhat
concernin
these
things
;.
I
would
shew
unto
the
world
.
that
faith
is
:
things
which
are
hoped
for
and
not
seen
;
wherefore
,..
.
dispute
not
becanse
ye
see
not
,
for
ye
receive
no
witness
until
.
after
the
trial
of
your
faith
,
for
it
.
was
by
:
faith
that
.
Christ
shewed
himself
unto
our
fathers
,
after
he'had
xisen
.
from
the
dead
;
and
he
shewed
not
him
[File:592]
self
unto
them
,
until
after
they
had
faith
in
him
;
wherefore
it
must
,
needs
be
that
some
had
faith
in
him
,
for
he
shewed
himself
not
unto
the
world
.
But
because
of
the
faith
of
men
,
he
has
shewn
himself
unto
the
world
,
and
glorified
the
name
of
the
Father
,
and
prepared
a
way
that
thereby
others
might
be
partakers
of
the
heavenly
gift
,
that
they
might
hope
for
those
things
which
they
have
not
seen
;
wherefore
ye
may
also
have
hope
,
and
be
partakers
of
the
gift
,
if
ye
will
but
have
faith
.
Behold
,-
it
was
by
faith
that
they
ot
old
:
were
called
after
the
hdly
order
of
God
;
wherefore
,
by
faith
,
was
the
law
of
Moses
given
.
But
im
the
gift
of
his
Son
,
hath
.
God
prepared
,
a
-
more
excellent
way
;
and
it
is
by
faith
that
it
hath
been
fulfilled
;
forif
there
be
no
faith
among
the
children
of
men
,
God
can
do
no
iniracle
among
them
;
wherefore
he
shewed
not
nimself
until
after
their
faith
.
Behold
,
it
was
the
faith
of
Al
-:
ma
and
Amulek
that
caused
the
prison
to
tumble
to
the
earth
.
Behold
,
it
was'the
faith
of
Nephi
and
Lehi
,
that
wrought
the
change
upon
the
Lamanites
,
that
they
were
baptized
with
fire
and
with
the
Holy
Ghost
.
Behold
,
it
was
the
faith
of
Ammon
and
his
brethren
,
which
wrought
so
great
amiracle
among
the
Lamanites
;
yea
,
and
even
all
they
-
who
wrought
miracles
,
wrought
them
by
.
faith
,
even
those
who
were'
before
Christ
,
and'algo
them
who
wore
after
.
And
it
was
by
faith
that
the
three
disciples
obtained
a
promise
that
they
should
not
taste
of
death
;
and
they
obtained
not
the
promise
until
after
their
faith
.
And
neither
,
at
any
time
hath/any
wrought
miracles
until
after
their
faith
;
wherefore
they
first
:
believed
in
the
Son
of
God
,
And
there
were
fnany
whose
faith
wasso
exceeding
strong
even
before
Christ
came
who
could
not
be
kept
from
within
,
the
veil
,
but
truly
saw
with
their
eyes
the
things
which
they
had
beheld
with
an
eye
of
faith
,
and
they
were
glad
.
And
behold
,
we
have
seen
in
this
record
,
that
one
of
these
was
the
brother
of
Jared
;
for
so
great
was
his
faith
in
God
,
that
when
God
put
forth
his
finger
,
he
could
not
hide
it
from
the
sight
of
the
brother
of
Jared
,
because
of
his
word'which
he
had
spoken
unto
him
,
which
word
he
had
obtained
by
faith
.
And
after
the
brotherof
Jared
had
heheld
the
finger
of
the
Lord
,
because
of
the
promise
which
the
broth
-
er
of
Jared
had
obtained
by
faith
,
the
Lord
could
not
withhold
any
thing
from
his
sight
;.
wherefore
he
shewed
:
him
all
things
,
for
he
could
no'
longer
be
kept
without
the
veil
.
And
:
it
is
by
faith
that
my
fa
[File:593]
thers
have
obtained
the
promise
that
these
things
should
come
unto
their
brethren
through
the
Gentiles
;
therefore
the
Lord
hath
commanded
:
me
,
yea
,
even
Jesus
Christ
.
.
And
I
said
unto
him
,
Lord
,
the
Gentiles
will
mock
at
tliese
things
,
because
of
our
weaknessin
writing
;
for
Lord
;
thou
hast
made
us
mighty
in
word
by
faith
,
but
thou
hast
not
made
us
mighty
in
writing
;
for
thou
hast
made
all
this
people
that
the
could
speak
much
,
because
of
the
Holy
Ghost
whic
theu
hast
given
them
;
and
thou
hast
made
us
that
we
could
write
but
little
,
because
of
the
awkwardness
of
our
hands
.
Behold
,
thou
bast
not
made
us
mighty
in
writing
like
unto
the
brother
of
Jared
,
for
thou
madest
him
that
the
things
which
he
wrote
,
were
mighty
even
as
thou
art
,
unto
the
overpowering
of
man
to
read
them
.
Thou
hast
-
also
made
our
words
powerful
and
great
,
even
that
we
cannot
write
them
;
wherefore
,
when
we
write
,
we
behold
our
weakness
,
and
stumble
because
of
the
placing
of
our
words
;
and
I
fear
lest
the
Gentiles
shall
mock
at
our
words
.
And
when
I
had
said
this
,
the
Lord
spake
unto
me
,
saying
,
fools
mock
,
but
they
shall
mourn
;
and
my
grace
is
sufficient
for
the
meek
,
that
they
shall
take
no
advantage
of
your
weakness
;
and
if
men
come
unto
me
,
]
will
shew
unto
them
their
weakness
.
I
give
unto
men
weakness
,
that
they
may
be
humble
;
and
my
grace
is
.
sufficient
for
all
men
that
humble
themselves
before
me
;
for
if
they
humble
themselves
.
before
me
,
and
have
faith
in
me
,
then
will
I
make
weak
things
become
strong
unto
them
..
Behold
;
I
will
shew
unto
the
Gentiles
their
weakness
,
and
I
will
shew
unto
them
that
faith
,
hope
,
and
charity
,
bringeth
unto
me
the
fountain
of
all
righteousness
.
And
I
,
Moroni
,
having
heard
these
words
,
was
comforted
,
and
said
,
O
Lord
,
thy
righteous
will
be
done
,
for
I
know
that
thou
workest
unto
the
children
of
men
according
to
their
faith
;
for
the
brother'of
-
Jared
said
-
unto
the
mountain
Zerin
,
remove
,
and
it
was
removed
.
And
if
he
had
not
had
faith
,
it
would
not
have
moved
;
wherefore
thou
workest
after
men
have
faith
;
for
thus
did
thou
manifest
thyself
unto
thy
disciples
.
For
after
they
had
faith
,
and
did
speak
in
thy
name
,
thou
didst
shew
thyself
unto
them
in
great
power
;
and
I
also
remember
that
thou
hast
said
that
thou
hast
prepared
.
a
house
for
man
;
yea
,
even
among
the
mansions
of
thy
Father
,
in
which
man
might
:
have
.
a
;
more
excellent
hope
;
wherefore
.:
man
must
hope
,
or
!
he
.
cannot
receive
an
inheritance'in
the
[File:594]
place
which
thow
hast
prepared
,
And
again
l
remember
that
thow
hast
said
that'
thou
hast
loved
the
world
,
even
unto
thelaying
down
of
thy
life
for
the
world
,
that
thot
mightest
,
take
it
again
to
prepare
a
place
for
the
children
of
men
.
And
now
T
know
that
this
love
which
thou
hast
hat
for
the
children
of
men
,
is
charity
;
wherefore
,
except'
men
shall
haye
charity
,
'
they
cannot
inherit
that
place
which
thou
hast
repared
in
the
mansions
of
thy
fatiier
.
-
Wherefore
,
I
know
by
.
this
.
thing
which
thou
hast
said
,
that
if
the
Gentiles
have
not
charity
,
because
of
our
weakness
,
that
thou
wilt
prove
them
,
and
take
away

And
it
came
to

that
I
prayed
.
unto'
the
Lord
that
he
would
give
unto
the'Gentiles
:
grace
,
that
they
might
have
charity
.
.
And
it
came'
to

that
the

said
unto
me
,
if

have

it

:
eth'
not

thou'hast

For
behold
,
they
rejected
all
the
words
of
Ether}
for
he
truly
told
thenv
of
:
all
things
,
from
the
beginning
of
man
;
and
that
after
the
waters
had
receded
from
off
the
face
of
this
land
,
it
became
a
choice
land
above
all
other
lands
,
a'chosen
land
of
the
Lord
;
wherefore
the
Lord
would
have'that
all
men
should
serve
him
,
who
dwell
upon
the
face
thereof
:
and
that
it
was
the
place'of
the
New
Jerusalem
,
which
should
come
down
out
of
heaven
,
and
the
holy
sanetuary
of
the
Lord
.
Behold
,
Ether
saw
the
days
of
Christ
,
and
he
spake
concerning
a
New
Jerusalem
upon
this
land
;
and
he
spake
also
concerning
the
house
of
Israel
,
and
the
Jerusalem
from
whence
Lehi
should
come
;
after
it
should
be
destroyed
,
it
should
:
be
built
up
again
a
holy
city
unto
the
Lord
:
wherefore
:
it
could
not
be
a
New
Jerusalem
,
for
it
had
been
ina
time
of
old
,
but
it
should
be
built
up
again
,
and
become
aholy
city
of
the
Lord
:
and
it
should
be
built
up
unto
:
the
house
of
Israel
;
and
that
a
New
Jerasalem
should
be
built
up
upon
this
land
,
unto
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
Joseph
,
for
whicly
things
there
has'
been'
a
type
;
for
as
Joseph
:
brought
his
father
down
into
the
land
of
Egypt
,
even
so
he
died
there
;
wherefore
the
Ford
brought
a
remnant
of
the
seed
of
Joseph
out
.
of
the
land
of
Jerusalem
,
that'
heimight
be
merciful
unto
the
seed
of
Joseph
,
that
they
should
:
perish
:
not
,
even
as
he
was
merciful
unto
the
father
of
Joseph
,
that
he
should
:
perish
not
;
wherefore
the
remnant
of
the
house
of
Joseph
shall
be
built
upor
this
lavid
;.
and
it
shall
be
a
land
of
their
inheritance
;
and
they'
shall
build'up'a'
holy
city
unto
the
Lord
,
like
unto'the
Jerusalem'of
old
;
and
they
shall'
no
more
be
confounded
,
until
the
end
come
,
when
the
earth
shall
:
pass
away
.
And
there'shall
be
a
new
heaven
and
anew
earth
;
and
they
shall
be
like
unto
the
old
,
save
the
old
:
have
passed
away
,
and
all
things
have
become
new
.
And
then
eometh
the
New
Jerusalem
;
and
blessed
are
they
who
.
dwell
therein
;
for
it
is
they
whose
garments
are
white
through
the
blood
of
the
Lamb
;
and
they
are
they
who
are
numbered
among
the
remnant
of
the
seed
of
Joseph
,
who
were
of
the
house
of
Israel
.
And
:
then
alsa
cometh
the
Jerusalem
of
old
;
and
the
inhabitants
thereof
,
blessed
are
they
,
for
they
have
been
washed
in
the
bloodof
the
Lamb
;
and'they'are
they
who
were
seattered
and
gathered
in
from
the
four
quarters'
of
the
eatth
,
and
from
the
north
countries
,
and
are
partakers
of
the
fulfilling
of
the
covenant
which
-
God
made
with
[File:596]
their
father
Abraham
.
And
when
these
things
,
come
,
bringeth
to
.
pass
the
soripture
which
saith
,
there
are
they
who
were

,
who
shall
be

and
there
are
they
who

Â©
And
I
was
about
to
write
more
,
but
I
am
forbidden
;
but
great
and
marvelous
were
the
prophecies
of
Ether
,
but
wey
esteemed
him
as
-
nought
,
and
cast
him
out
,
and
he
hid
himself
in
the
cavity
of
a
rock
by
day
,
and
by
night
he
went
forth
viewing
the
things
which
should
come
upon
the
people
.
And
as
he
dwelt
in
the
oavity
of
a
rock
,
he
made
the
remainder
of
this
record
,
viewing
the
deetructions
which
came
upon
,
the
people
by
night
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
in
-
that
same
year
which
he
was
cast
out
from
among
the
people
,
there
began
to
be
a
great
war
among
the
people
,
for
there
were
many
who
rose
up
who
were
mighty
men
,
and
sought
to
destroy
Coriantumr
by
their
secret
plans
of
wickedness
,
of
which
.
hath
been
spoken
.
And
now
Coriantumr
,
having
studied
himself
in
all
the
arts
of
war
,
and
all
the
cunning
of
the
world
,
wherefore
he
gave
battle
unto
them
who
sought
to
destroy
him
;
but
he
repented
not
,
neither
his
fair
sons
nor
daughters
;
neither
the
fair
sons
and
daughters
of
Cohor
;
neither
the
fair
sons
and
daughters
of
Corihor
;
and
in
fine
,
there
was
none
of
the
fair
sons
and
daughters
upon
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
,
who
repented
of
their
sins
:
wherefore
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
first
year
that
Ether
dwelt
in
the
cavity
of
a
rock
,
there
was
many
people
who
were
slain'
by
.
the
sword
of
those
secret'
combinations
fighting
against
Coriantumr
,
that
they
might
obtain
the
kingdom
..
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
the
sons
of
Coriantumr
fought
much
,
and
bled
much
.
'
And
.
in
the
second
year
,
the
word
of
the
Lord
came
to
Ether
,
that
he
should
go
and
prophesy
unto
.
Coriantumr
,
that
if
he
would
repent
,
and
all
his
household
,
the
Lord
would
give
unto
him
.
bis
kingdom
,
and
spare'
the
people
,
otherwise
they
should
be
.
destroyed
,
and
all
his
household
,
save
it
were
himself
,
and
le
should'
only
live
.
to
see'the
fulfilling
of
the
prophecies
which
had
.
been
spoken
:
concerning
another
people
receiving
the
land
for
their
-
inheritance
;-:
and
Coriantumr
should
receive
4
burialby
:
them
;
:
and
.
every
soul
should
be
destroyed
save
it
were
Coriantumr
...
And
it
:
came
.,
to
,
pass
that
Coriantamr
.
repented
not
,
neither
-
his
-
household
,
:
neither
the
people
;
and
the
:
wars
ceased
not
;
and
they
~~
govght
te
kill
Ether
,
but
he
fled
from
:
before
them
,
4
[File:597]
and
:
hid
again
in
the
cavity
.
ofthe
rock
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
there
arose
up
Shared
,
and
-
he
also
gave
battle
unto
Coriantumr
;
and
he
did
beat
:
him
,
insomuch
that
in
the
third
year
-
he
did
bring
him
.
into
captivity
.
And
the
sons
of
Coriantumr
,
in
the
fourth
year
,
did
beat
Shared
,
and
did
obtain
the
-
kingdom
again
unto
their
father
.
Now
there
began
to
be
a
war
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
,
every
man
with
his
band
,
fighting
for
that
which
he
desired
.
And
:
there
were
robbers
,
and
in
fine
,
all
manner
of
wickedness
upon'
all
the
face
of
the
land
.
And
it
came
td
pass
that
Coriantumr
was
exceeeding
-
angry
with
Shared
,
and
he
went
against
,
him
with
his
armies
,
to
.
battle
;
and
.
they
did
meet
in
great
anger
;
and
they
-
did
meet
in'the
valley
of
Gilgal
;
and
the
battle
became
exceeding'sore
..
And
it
came
to
pass
that'
Shared'
fought
against
him
for
the
space
of
three
days
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Coriantumr
beat
him
,
and
did
pursue
him
until
-
he
came
to
the
plains
of
Heshlon
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Shared
gave
him
battle
again
upon
the
plains
;
and
behold
,
he
did
beat
Coriantumr
,
and
drove
him
:
back
:
agate
to
-
the
valley
of
Gilgal
.
-
And
Coriantumr'gaveShared
battle
again
in
the
valley
of
Gilgal
,
in
which
he
beat
Shared
,
and
slew
him
.
-
And
Shared
wounded
Coriantumr
,
in
his
thigh
,
that
he
did
not
go
to
battle
again
for
the
space
of
two
years
,
in
which
time
all
the
people
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
were
shedding
blood
,
and
there
was
none
.
to
restrain
them
.
And
now
there
began
to
bea
great
eurse
upon
all
the
land
,
because'
of
the
iniquity
of
the
people
,
in
which
,
ifa
man
should
lay
his
tool
or
his
sword
upon
his
shelf
,
or
upon
the
place
whither
he
-
would
keep
it
,
and
behold
,
upon
the
inorrow
,
he
could
not
find
it
,
so
great
was
the
curse
upon
the
land
,
Wherefore
every
man
did
cleave
unto
.
that
which
.
was
-
his
own
,
with
.
his
hands
,
and
:
would
not
borrow
,
neither
would
he
lend
:
and
every
man
kept
the
hilt
of
his
sword
thereof
,
in
his
right
-
hand
,
in
the
defence
of
his
property
and
his
own
life
;-
and'of
his
wives
and
children
.
And
now
after
the'spaee
of
two
years
,
and'
after
the
death
of
Shared
,
behold
,
there
arose
the
brother
of
Shared
,
and'he
gave
battle
anto
Coriantumr
,
in
which
Coriantumr
did
beat
him
,
and
did
pursue
him
to
the
.
wilderness
:
of'
Akish
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
brother
of
Shared
did
give
battle
unto'
him
in
the
wilderness
of
Akish
;
and
the
.
battle
became
exceeding
sore
,
and
many'
thousands
fell
by
the
sword
:
And
it
oame
to
pass'
that
[File:598]
Coriantumr
did
lay
siege
to
the
wilderness
,
and
the
-
brother
of
Shared
did
march
forth
out
of
the
wilderness
by
night
,
and
slew
a
part
of
the
army
of
Coriantumr
,
as
they
were
drunken
.
And
he
came
forth
to
the
Jand
.
of
Moron
,
and
placed
himself
upon
.
the
throne
of
;
Coriantumr
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Coriantumr
dwelt
with
his
army
in
the
wilderness
,
for
the
space
of
two
years
,
in
which
he
did'
receive
great
strength
to
his
army
.
Now
the
brother
of
Shared
,
whose
name
was
Gilead
,
also
received
,
great
strength
to
his
army
,
because
of
secret
combinations
.
And
it
eame
to
pass
that
his
high
priest
murdered
him
as
he
satuponhis
throne
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
one
.
of
the
secret
combinations
,
murdered
him
.
in
a
secret
pass
,
and
obtained
unto
himself
the
kingdom
;
and
his
name
was
Lib
;
and
Lib
was
.
a
man
of
great
stature
,
more
than
any
other
man
among
all
the
people
.
And
it
came'to
pass
that
in
the
first
year
of
Lib
,
Coriantumr
came
up
unto
the
land
of
Moron
,
and
gave
battle
unto
Lib
.
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
he
fought
with
Lib
,
in
-
which
Lib
did
smite
upon
his
arm
.
that
he
was
wounded
;
-
neyertheless
,
the
army
of
Coriantymr
.
did
_press
forward
upon
Lib
,
that
he
fled
to
the
borders
upon
the
seashore
.
.
And
it
came
to
.
pass
that
Coriantumr
pursued
him
;
and
.
Lib
gave
battle
unto
him
upon
the
seashore
.
-
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Lib
did
smite
the
army
of
Coriantumr
,
that
they
fled
again
to
the
wildernes
of
Akish
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Lib
did
pursue
him
until
he
came
to
the
plains
of
Agosh
.
And
Coriantumr
had
taken
all
.
the
.
people
with
him
,
as
he
fled
before
Lib
,
in
that
quarter
.
of
the
Jand
whither
he
fled
.
And
when
he
had
come
to
the
plains
of
Aposh
,
he
gave
battle
unto
Lib
,
and
he
smote
upon
him
until
he
died
;
nevertheless
,
the
:
brother
.
of
Lib
did
come
against
Coriantumr
in
the
stead
thereof
,
and
the
battle
became
.
exceeding
.
sore
,
in
the
which
Coriantumr
fled
again
before
the
army
of
the
brother
of
Lib
,
Now
the
name
-
of
the
brother
of
Lib
wasealled
Shiz
.
And
.
it
came
to
.
pass
that
Shiz
pursued
afler
Coriantumr
,
and
he
did
.
overthrow
many
cities
,
and
.
he
did
.
slay
both
women
and
children
,
and
he
did
burn
the
cities
thereof
;
and
.
there
went
a
fear
of
Shiz
throughout
all
the
land
;
yea
,.
a
cry
went
forth
throughout
the
land
,
who
cam
stand
.
before
the
army
of
Shiz
?:
Behold
,
he
sweepeth
.
the
earth
before
him
!
And
it
.
came
1o
pass
that
the
people
began
to
flock
together
in
armies
,
throughout
all
the
face
of
the
Jand
.
[File:599]
And
.
they
were
divided
,
and
a
part
of
them
fled
to
the
army
of
Shiz
,
and
.
a
part
of
them
fled
to
the
army
of
Coriantumr
.
And
so
great
and
lasting
had
been
the
war
,
and
so
long
had
been
the
scene
of
bloodshed
and
carnage
,
that
the
whole
face
of
the
land
was
covered
with
the
bodies
of
the
dead
;
and
so
swift
.
and
speed
was
the
war
,
that
there
was
none
left
to
bury
the
dead
,
but
:
they
did
march
forth
from
the
shedding
of
blood
,
to
the
shedding
of
blood
,
leaving
the
hodies
of
both
men
,
women
and
children
,
strewed
upon
,
the
face
of
the
land
,
to
become
a
prey
to
the
worms
of
the
flesh
;
and
the
scent
thereof
went
forth
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
even
upon
all
the
face
of
the
land
;
wherefore
the
people
became
troubled
by
day
and
by
night
,
because
of
the
scent
thereof
;
nevertheless
,
Shiz
did
not
ease
to
pursue
Coriantumr
,
for
he
had
sworn
to
avenge
himself
upon
Coriantumr
of
the
blood
of
his
-
brother
,
who
had
been
slain
,
and
the
word
of
the
Lord
which
came
to
Ether
,
that
Coriantamr
should
not
falk
by
the
sword
.
And
thus
we
see
that
the
Lord
did
visit
them
in
the
fulness
of
his
wrath
,
and
their
-
wickedness
and
abominations
,
had
prepared
away
for
their
everlasting
destruction
.
-
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Shiz
did
pursue
Coriantumr
eastward
,-
eyen
to
the
borders
of
the
seashore
,
and
there
he
gave
battle
unto
Shiz
for
the
space
of
three
days
;
and
so
terrible
was
the
destruction
among
the
armies
of
Shiz
,
that
the
people
began
.
to
be
frightened
,
and
began
to
flee
before
the
armies
of
Coriantumr
;
and
they
fled
to
the
Jand
of
Corihor
,
and
swept
off
the
inhabitants
.
before
them
,
all
they
that
would
not
join
them
;
and
they
pitched
their
tents
in
the
valley
of
Corihor
.
And
Coriantumr
pitched
his
tents
in
the
valley
of
Shurr
.
Now
the
valley
of
Shurr
was
near
the
hill
Comnor
;
wherefore
.
Coriantumr
did
gather
his
armies
together
,
upon
the
hill
Comnor
,
and
did
sound
a
trumpet
unto
the
armies
of
Shiz
,
to
invite
them
forth
to
battle
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
forth
,
but
were
driven
again
;
and
they
eame
the
second
time
;
and
they
were
driven
again
the
second
time
.
_And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
came
again
the
third
time
,
and
the
battle
became
exceeding
sore
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Shiz
.
smote
upon
Coriantumr
,
that
he
gave
him
many
deep
wounds
.
.
Aad
Coriantumr
haying
lost
his
blood
,
fainted
,
and
was
carried
away
as
though
he
were
dead
.
.
Now
:
the
loss
.
of
men
,
women
and
:
child~
[File:600]
ren
,
on
both
sides
,
was'so
great
that
Shiz'
commanded
his
people
that
they
should
:-
not
:
pursue
the
armies
of
Coriantumr
;
'
wherefore
they
returned
to
their
camp
.
:
:
And
it
came
to
pass
,
when
Coriantumr
had
.
recover
.
ed
of
his
wounds
,
he
began
to
remember
the
words
which
Ether
had
spoken
unto
him
;
he
saw
that
there
had
been
slain
by
the
sword
:
already
nearly
two
millions
of
his
people
,
and
he
began
:
to
-
sorrow
in
his
heart
;
yea
,
there
had
been
slain
two
millions
of
mighty
men
,
and
also
their
wives
and
their
-
children
.
He
began
to
repent
of
the
evil
which
he
had
done
;
he
betoxremember
the
words
which
had
been
:
spoken
by
the
mouth
ofall
the
.
prophets
,
and
he
saw
them
that
they
were
fulfilled
,
thus
far
,
every
whit
:
and
his
soul
:
mourned
,
and
refused
to
be
comforted
.
'
And
it
eame
to
pass
that
he
wrote
an
epistle
unto
:
Shiz
,
de
.
siring
him
that
he
:
would
spare
the
people
,.
and
he
would
give
up
the
kingdom
for
the
sake
of
the
lives
of
the
people
,
And
:
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Shiz
:
had
received
:
his
:
epistle
,
he
wrote
-
anespistle
:
unto
Coriantun
,
thatdf
:
he
-
would
give
himself
up
,
that
-
he
might
slay
him
with
his
own
sword
,
that
he
wouldspare
the
lives
of
the
:
people
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
people
repented
not
of
their
iniquity
;
and
the
peopleof
Coriantumr
were'stirred
up
to'anger
against
the
people
of
Shiz
;
'and
the
people
of
Shiz
were
stirred
up
to
-
anger
against
the
people
of
Coriantamr
;
wherefore
the
people
of
Shiz
did
give
battle
unto
the
people
of
Coriantumr
.
.
And
:
when
Coriantumr
:
saw
that
he
was
about
'to
fall
;
he
fled
again
before
the
people
of
Shiz
.
And
it
came
to
:
pass
that
he
came
to
the
waters
of
-
Riplianeum
,
which
,
by
interpretation
,
is
large
,
orto
exceed
-
all
;
wherefore
,
when
they
came
to
these
waters
,
they
pitched
their
tents
;
and
:
Shiz
also'
pitched
his
tents
near
unto
them
;
and
:
therefore
on
the
morrow
,
-
they
did
come
to
battle
..
And
:
it
.
came
to
pass
that
they
fought
an
exceeding
sore
battle
,
in
which
Coriantumr
was
wounded
again
,
and
:
He
fainted
with
the
loss
of
-
blood
.
.
And
:
it
came
to
:
pass
:
that
the
armies
of
Coriantumr
did
press
upon
the
armies
:
of
Shiz
,
that
:-
they
beat
them
,-
that
they
,
caused
them
:
torflee
before
them
;
and
they
did
flee
:
southward
;
and
did
pitch
their
tents
<in
.
a
-
place
which
was
:
called
Ogathy
And
it
came
to
pass
that
the
army
:
of
Coriantumr
did
pitch
their
tents
-
by
the
hill
Ramah
;
anditowas
:
that
same
hill
:
where
my
father
Mormon
did
hide
up
the
records
unto
the
[File:601]
Lord
,
which
were
.
saered
;.,
And
..
it
.
came
to
pass
that
they
did
gather
together
all
,
the
people
,
upon
all
the
iace
.
of
the
Jand
,
who
had
.
not
.
been
slain
,
save
it
was
Ether
.
..
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Ether
did
behold'all
the
doings
of
the
people
;
and
he
beheld
that
the
people
:
who
were
for
Coriantumr
,
were
gathered
together
to
.
the
army
of
Coriantumz
;
and
the
people
who
.
were
for
Shiz
,
were
gathered
together
to
the
army
.
of
Shiz
;
wherefore
they
were
for
the
space
of
four
years
,
gathering
together
the
people
,
that
they
might
get
all
who
were
upon
the
face
of
the
land
,
and
that
.
they
.
might
receive
;
all
the
strength
which
it
was
.
possible
:
that
they
could
receive
.
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
were
all
.
gathered
:
together
,
every
one
to
the
army
which
.
he
would
,
with
their
wives
,
and
their
children
;
both
men
,
women

and
children
being
armed
with
weapons
of

,
having
shields
,
and
breast

plates
,
and
head
-
plates
,
and
being
clothed
after
the
manner
of
war
,
they
.
did
march
forth
one
against
another
,
to
battle
;
and
tiey
fought
all
that
day
,
and
.
conquered
not

And
it
,
ame
to
pass
that
when
it
was
night
theywere
weary
;
and
retired
to
their
camps
;
and
after
they
had
retired
to
their
camps
,
they
took
up
.
a
howling
and
.
a
lamentation
for
the
loss
of
the
slain
of
their
people
;
.
and
so
great
were
theircries
,
their
howlings
and
lamentations
;
that
.
it
did
rend
the
air
exceedingly
...
And
it
came
to
.
pass
that
on
the
morrow
they
did
.
go
again
to
battle
,
and
great
and
terrible
was
that
day
;
nevertheless
they
conquered
not
,
and
when
the
night
came
,
again
,
they
did
rend
,
the
air
with
.
their
series
,
and
.
their
howlings
,
and
their
mournings
,
for
the
loss
of
the
slain

of

people
.
i
MS
And
.
it
;
came
to
pass
..
that
Coriantumr
.
wrote
again
anepistle
-
unto
Shiz
,
desiring
that
he
would
not
come
again
.
to
battle
,
but
.
that
he
would
take
the
kingdom
,
and
spare
the
.
lives
of
the
people
...
But
behold
,
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
.
had
ceased
striving
with
them
,
and
satan
:
had
full
.
power
over
the
hearts
.
of
the
people
,
for
they
.
were
given
up
unto
the
hardness
of
their
-
hearts
,
and
the
blindness
of
their
minds
,
that
they
might
be
destroyed
;
wherefore
they
went
again
to
battle
.
And
it
came
.
to'
pass
:
that
they
fought
ali
that
day
,
and
when
the
night
came
they
slept
upon
their
swords
;
and
on
the
morrow
they
fought
even
until
the
night
came
;
and
when
the
night
came
they
were
drunken
with
anger
,
even
as
a
man
who
is
drunken
with
wine
;
and
they
slept
again
upon
their
swords
;
and
on
the
[File:602]
morrow
they
fought
again
;
and
when
the
night
came
they
had
all
fallen
by
the
sword
,
save
it
were
fifty
and
two
of
the
people'of
Coriantumr
,
and
sixty
and
nine
of
the
people
of
Shiz
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
glept
upon
their
swords
that
night
,
and
on
the
morrow
they
fought
again
,
and
they
contended
in
their
mights
with
their
swords
,
and
with
their
shields
,
all
that
day
;
and
when
the
night
came
there
were
thirty
and
two
of
the
peopleof
Shiz
,
and
twenty
and
seven
of
the
people
of
Coriantumr
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
ate
and
slept
,
and
prepared
for
death
on
the
morrow
.
And
they
were
large
and
mighty
men
,
as
to
the
strength
of
men
.
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
they
fought
for
:
the
space
of
three
hours
,
and
they
fainted
with
the
loss
of
blood
.
And
.
it
came
to
pass
that
when
the
men
of
Coriantumr
had
received
sufficient
strength
,
that
they
could
walk
,
they
were
about
to
-
fiee
for
their
lives
,
but
behold
,
Shiz
arose
,
and
also
his
men
,
and
he
swore
in
his
:
wrath
that
be
.
would
slay
Coriantumr
,
'
or
he
would
perish
by
the
sword
;
wherefore
he
did
-
pursue
them
,
and
onthe
morrow
he
did
overtake
them
;
'
and
they
fought
again
with
the
sword
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
they
had
all
fallen
by
the
sword
,
save
it
were
Coriantumr
and_
Shiz
,
behold
,
Shizhad
.
fainted
with
loss
of
blood
..
And
it
came
to
pass
that
when
Coriantumr
had
leaned
upon
his
sword
,
that
he
rested
a
little
,
he
smote
off
the
head
of
Shiz
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
afler
he
had
smote'off'the
head
of
Shiz
,
that
Shiz
-
raised
upon
his
hands
and
fell
;
and
after
that
he
had
struggled
for
breath
,
he
died
.
And
it
came
to
pass
that
Coriantumr
fell
to
the
earth
,
and
became
as
if
he
had
no
life
.
And
the
Lord
spake
unto
Ether
,
and
said
unto
him
,
go
forth
...
And
he
went
forth
;
and
beheld
that
the
words
of
the
Lord
:
had
all
been
fulfilled
;
and
-
he
finished
:
his
record
;

CHAPTER
I
.
Now
I
,
Moroni
,
after
having
made
an
end
of
abridging
the
account
of
the
people
of
Jared
,
I
had
supposed
not
to
have
written
more
,
but
I
have
not
as
yet
perished
;
and
I
make
not
myself
known
to
the
Lamanites
,
lest
they
should
destroy
me
.
For
behold
,
their
wars
are
exceeding
fierce
.
among
themselves
;
and
because
of
their
hatied
,
they
put
to
death
every
Nephite
that
will
not
deny
the
Christ
.
And
I
,
Moroni
,
will
not
deny
the
Christ
;
wherefore
,
[
wander
whithersoever
I
can
,
for
the
safety
of
mine
own
life
.
Wherefore
I
write
a
few
more
things
,
contrary
to
that
which
Lhad
supposed
;
for
I
had
supposed
not
to
have
written
any
more
;
but
I
write
a
few
more
things
,
that
peo
they
may
be
of
worth
unto
my
brethren
,
the
nites
,
in
some
future
day
,
according
to
the
will
of
the
Lord
.

Tx
words
of
Christ
,
which
he
spake
unto
his
:
disciples
,
the
twelve
whom
he
had
chosen
,
as
he
laid
hig
hands
upon
them
,
And
he
called
them
by
name
,
saying
,
ye
shall
call
on
the
Father
in
my
name
,
in
mighty
prayer
;
and
after
ye
have
done
this
,
ye
shall
have

power
that
on

whom
ye
shall
lay

ye
shall
give
the
Holy
Ghost
;
and
in
my
name
:
shall
ye
give
it
,
for
thus
de
mine
apostles
.
Now
Christ
spake
these
words
unto
them
at
the
time
of
his
first
appearing
;
and
the
multitude
heard
it
not
,
but
the
disciples
heard
it
;

on
as
many
.
as
they
laid

Axnp
now
I
speak
concerning

.
Behold
,
elders
,
priests
,
and
.
teachers
.
were
baptized
;
and
they
were
-
not
baptized
,
save
they
brought
forth
fruit
meet
that
they
were
worthy
of
it
;
neither
did
.
they
receive
any
unto
baptism
,
save
they
came
forth
with
a
broken
heart
and
a
contrite
.
spirit
,
and
,
witnessed
unto
the
church
that
they
truly
repented
of
all
their
sins
,
And
none
were
received
unto
baptism
,
save
they
took
upon
them
the
name
of
Christ
,
having
a
determination
to
gerve
him
to
the
end
.
And
after
they
had
been
received
,
unto
baptism
,.
and
were
wrought
upon
and
cleansed
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
they
were
numbered
among
the
people
of
the
church
of
Christ
,
and
their
names
were
taken
,
that
they
might
be
.
remembered
and
nourished
by
.
the
good
word
.
of
God
,
to
keep

them
in
the
right
way
,
to
keep
them
continually

unto
prayer
,
relying
alone
upon
the
merits
of
Christ
,
who
was
the
author
and
the
finisher
of
their
faith
,
.
And
.
the
church
did
.
meet
together
oft
,
to
fast
and
to
.
pray
,
and
to
speak
one
with
another
concerning
.
the
welfare
of
their
souls
;
and
they
did
meet
to
ther
oft
.
to
partake
of
bread
and
.
wine
,.
in

rememae
of
the
Lord
.
Jesus
;
and
they
.
were
strict
to
observe
that
.
there
should
be
no
iniquity
among
them
;
and
.
whoso
.
was
found
to
commit
.
iniquity
,
and
three
witnesses
of
the
church
:
did
condemn
them
before
the
elders
;
and
if
they
repented
not
,
and
confessed
not
,
their
names
were
blotted
out
,
and
.
they
were
not
numbered
among
the
people

of
Christ
;
but
as
oft
as
.
they
repented
,
and
.
sought
forgiveness
,
with
real
intent
,
they
-
were
forgiven
.
.
And
-
their
meetings
were
conducted
by
the
church

manner

Ghost
led
them

,
or
to
pray

CHAPTER
VII
.
Axp
now
I
,
Moroni
,
write
a
few
of
the
words
of
my
father
Mormon
,
which
he
spake
concerning
faith
,
hope
and
charity
;
for
after
this
manner
did
he
speak
unto
the
people
,
as
he
taught
them
in
the
synagogue
which
they
had
built
for
the
place
of
worship
.
And
now
,
I
,
Mormon
,
speak
unto
you
,
my
-
beloved
breth
-:
ren
;
and
it
is
by
the
grace
of
God
,
the
Father
,
and
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
,
and
his
holy
will
,
because
of
the
ee
of
his
calling
unto
me
,
that
J
am
permitted
to
speak
unto
you
at
this
time
;
wherefore
I
would
speak
unto
you
that
are
of
the
church
,
that
are
the
peace
,
able
followers
of
Christ
,
and
that
have
obtained
a
sufficient
hope
,
by
which
ye
can
enter
into
the
rest
of
the
Lord
,
from
this
time
henceforth
,
until
ye
shall
rest
with
him
in
heaven
.
And
now
my
brethren
,
I
judge
these
things
of
you
because
of
your
peaceable
w
with
the
children
of
men
;
for
I
remember
the
word
of
God
,
which
saith
,
by
their
works
ye
shall
know
them
;
for
if
their
works
be
good
,
then
they
are
good
also
,
For
behold
,
God
hath
said
,.
a
man
being
evil
,
cannot
do
that
which
is
good
;
for
if
he
offereth
a
gift
,
or
prayeth
unto
God
,
except
he
shall
do
it
with
real
intent
,
it
profiteth
him
nothing
.
For
behold
,
it
is
not
counted
unto
him
for
righteousness
,
For
behold
,
ifa
man
being
evil
,
giveth
a
gift
,
he
doth
it
gredgingly
:
wherefore
it
is
counted
unto
him
the
same
as
it
he
had
retained
the
gift
;
wherefore
he
is
counted
evil
before
God
.
And
likewise
also
is
it
counted
evil
unto
a
man
,
if
he
shall
pray
,
and
not
with
real
intent
of
heart
;
yea
,
and
it
profiteth
him
nothing
:
for
God
receiveth
none
such
;
wherefore
,
a
man
being
evil
,
cannot
do
that
which
is
good
;
neither
will
he
gre
a
good
gift
.
For
behold
,
a
bitter
fountain
cannot
.
bring
forth
good
water
;
neither
can
a
good
fountain
bring
forth
bitter
water
;
whereforea
man
being
a
servant
of
the
devil
,
eannot
follow
Christ
;
and
if
he
follow
Christ
,
[File:607]
he
cannot
be
a
servant
of
the
devil
..
Wherefore
,
all
things
which
are
good
,
cometh
of
God
;
and
that
which
is
evil
,
cometh
of
the
devil
;
for
the
devil
is
an
enemy
unto
God
,
and
fighteth
against
him
continually
,
and
inviteth
and
enticeth
to
sin
,
and
to
do
that
which
'is
evil
continually
.
But
behold
,
that
which
is
of
God
,
inviteth
and
enticeth
to
do
good
continually
;
wherefore
,
every
thing
which
inviteth
and
enticeth
to
-
do
good
,
and
to
love
God
,
and
to
serve
him
,
is
inspired
of
God
.
Wherefore
take
heed
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
that
ye
do
not
judge
that
which
is
evil
to
be
of
God
,
or
that
which
is
good
and
ef
God
,
to
be
of
the
devil
.
For
behold
,
my
brethren
,
it
is
given
unto
you
to
judge
,
that
ye
may
know
good
from
evil
;
and
the
way
to
judge
is
as
plain
,
that
ye
may
know
with
a
perfect
ane
eet
as
the
daylight
is
from
the
dark
night
.
For
behold
,
the
spirit
of
Christ
is
given
to
every
man
,
that
they
may
know
good
from
evil
;
wherefore
I
shew
unto
you
the
way
to
judge
:
for
every
thing
which
inviteth
to
.
do
good
,
and
to
persuade
to
believe
in
Christ
,
is
sent
forth
by
the
power
and
gift
of
Christ
;
wherefore
ye
may
know
with
a
perfect
.
knowledge
,
it
is
of
God
;
but
whatsoever
thing
persuadeth
men
to
do
evil
,
and
believe
not
in
Christ
,
and
deny
him
,
and
serve
not
God
,
then
ye
may
know
with
a
perfect
knowledge
it
is
of
the
devil
,
for
after
this
manner
doth
the
devil
work
,
for
he
persuadeth
no
man
to
do
good
,
no
not
one
;
neither
doth
his
angels
;
neither
do
they
who
subject
themselves
unto
him
.
Koi
now
my
brethren
,
seeing
that
ye
know
the
light
by
.
which
ye
may
judge
,
which
light
is
the
light
of
Christ
,
see
that
.
ye
do
not
judge
wrongfully
;
for
with
that
same
judgment
which
ye
judge
,
ye
shall
also
be
judged
.
Wherefore
I
beseech
of
you
,
brethren
,
that
ye
should
search
diligently
in
the
hight
of
Christ
,
that
ye
may
know
good
from
evil
;
and
if
ye
will
lay
hold
upon
every
good
thing
,
and
condemn
it
not
,
ye
certainly
will
be
a
child
of
Christ
.
And
now
,
my
brethren
,
how
is
it
possible
that
ye
can
lay
hold
upon
every
good
thing
?
And
now
I
come
to
that
faith
,
of
ny
said
I
would
speak
;
and
I
will
tell
.
you
the
way
whereby
ye
may
lay
hold
on
every
good
:
thing
.
For
behold
,
God
knowing
all
things
,
being
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
,
behold
,
he
sent
angels
to
minister
unto
-
the
children
of
men
,
to
make
manifest
concerning
the
coming
:
of
Christ
;
and
in
Christ
there
should
come
:
every
good
thing
.
And
God
also
declar
apt
[File:608]
ed
unto
prophets
,
by
his
own
.
month
,
'
that
:
Christ
should
come
.
And
behold
,
there
were
diverse
ways
that
he
did
manifest
things
unto
the
children
of
men
,
which
were
good
;
and
all
things
which
are
good
,
cometh
of
Christ
,
otherwise
men
were
fallen
,
and
there
could
no
good
thing
come
unto
them
.
Wherefore
,
by
the
ministering
of
angels
,
and
by
every
word
which
proceeded
forth
out
of
the
mouth
of
God
,
men
began
:
1o
-
exercise
faithin
Christ
;
and
-
thus
by
faith
,
they'did
lay
hold
upon
every
good
thing
;
and
thus
it
was
until
.
the
coming
of
Christ
.
And
after
that
he
came
,
mien
also
were
saved
by
faith
in
his
name
;
and
by
.
faith
,
they
-
become
the
sons
of
God
...
And
as
sure
as
Christ
liveth
,
he
spake
these
words
unto
our
fathers
,
saying
,
whatsoever
thing
ye
shall
ask
the
Father
in
my
name
;
which
is
good
,
in
faith'
believing
that
:
ye
suall
receive
,
behold
,
it
shall
be
done
unto
you
.
Wherefore
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
hath
miracles
ceased
,
because
Christ
:
hath
ascended
into
heaven
,
and
hath
set
down
on
the
:
right
hand
of
God
,
to
-
claim
of
the
Father
his
rights
of
mercy
which
he
hath
upon
the
children
of
men
;
for
he
hath
answered
the
ends
of
_
thedaw
,
and
he
claimeth
all
those
who
have
faith
in
him
;
and
they
who
have
faith
in
him
,
will
cleave
unto
-
every
good
thing
;
wherefore
he
:-
advocateth
the
cause
of
the
children
of
men
;
and
he
dwelleth
eternally
.
in
the
heavens
.,
And
-
because
he
hath
done
.
thie
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
hath
miracles
ceased
?
Behold
I
say
unto
you
,
nay
;
neither
have
-
angels
ceased
.
to
minister
unto
the
children
of
men
.:
For
behold
,
they
are
subject
unto
him
,
to
:
minister
according
to
the
word
of
his
command
,
shewing
themselves
unto
them
of
strong
faith
and
a
firm
mind
,
in
every
form'of
gadliness
.
-
And
the
office
of
their
ministry
is
,
to~
call
..
Men
unto
repentance
,
and
to
fulfil
and
to
do
the
work
of
the
covenants
of
the
Father
which'
he
hath
made
unto
the
children
of

to
prepare

way
among
the
children
of
men
,
by
deelaring
the
word
of
Christ
unto
the
chosen
vensake

Lund
,
that
they

may
bear
testimony
of
him
;
and
by
so
doing
,
the
Lord
God
:
prepareth
the

that
the

that

and
after
this
manner
bringetl

to

the
Father

:
which
-
he
hath

made

unto
the
children

And'
Christ

;
if

And
he
hath
said

all
ye
ends
of
the
earth
,
and
:
come
unto
me
and
be
baptized
:
in
my
name
,
and'have
faith
in
me
,
that
ye
may
be
saved
,
And
now
my
beloved
bretliren
,
if
this
:
be
the
.
case
that
:
these
things
are
true
which
I
have
spoken
unto
you
,
and
God
will
shew
unto
you
with
power
and
great
glory
at
:
the
Jast
day
,
that
they
are
true
;
andif
they
are
true
,
has
the
day
of
miracles
ceased
?
or
have
angels
ceased
to
appear
unto
the
children
of
men
?.
or
has
he
withheld
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
from
them
?
or
will
he
,
so
-
long
.
as
time
shail
last
,
or
the
earth
shall
stand
,
or
there
shall
be
one
man
upon
the
face
thereof
to
be
saved
?)
Behold
I
say
unto
you
:
nay
;
for
it
-
is
by
faith
that
miracles
are
wrought
;
and
.
it
18
by
faith
that
angels
appear
and
minister
-
unto
men
;
wherefore
if
these
things
have
ceased
,
wo
be
unto
the
children
of
men
,
for
itis
because
of
unbelief
,
and
all
is
vain
;
for
no
man
can
b2
saved
,
according
to
the
words
of
Christ
,
saveithey
shall
have
faith
in
his
name
;
wherefore
,
if
these
things
have
ceased
,
then
has
faith
ceased
also
;
and
awful
is
the
state
of
man
;
for
they
are
as
though
there
-
had
been
no
redemption
made
..
But
behold
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
I
judge
better
things
of
-
you
,
for
I
judge
that
yehave
faith
in
Christ
-
because
of
your
meekness
;
for
if
ye
have
not
faith
in
him
,
then
ye
ate
not
fit'to
be
numbered
among
the
people
of
his
church
.
And
again
my
beloved
brethren
,
1
.
would
speak
unto
you
concerning
hope
.
.
How
is
it
that
-
ye
can
attain
unto
faith
,
save
ye
shall
have
hope
?
And
what
is
it
that
ye
shall
hope
for
?.
Behold
say
unto
you
,
that
ye
shall
have
hope
through
the
atonement
of
Christ
-
and
the
power
of
bis
resurrection
,
tobe
raised
unto'
life
eternal
;
and
this
because
of
your
faith
in
him
according
to
the
:
promise
;
wherefore
,
if
:
a
man
drave
faith
,
he
must
needs
have
hope
;
-
for
-
without
faith
there
cannot
be
any
hope
.
And
again
,
behold
I
say
unto
you
,
that
he
cannot
have
faith
and
hope
;
save
:
he
shall
be
meek
,
and
lowly
of
heart
;
ifso
,
his
faith
and
hope
is'vain
,
for
:
none
is
acceptable
before
God
,
save
the'meek>
and
-
lowly
of
heart
;
and
if
a
man
be
meek
and
lowly
in
heart
,
and
confesses
by
:
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;
that
Jesus
:
is
tle
.
Christ
,
he
must
:
needs
have
-
charity
;
for
if
hehave
not
charity
,
he
is
nothing
;
wherefore
he
must
needs
have
charity
...
And
:
charity
suffereth
long
,
and
is
kind
,
and
envieth
not
,
andis
not

and

,
beareth
all

,:
believeth
all
things
,
hopeth
all
things
,
endureth

things
;
wherefore
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
if
ye
have
not
charity
,
ye
are
nothing
,
for
charity
:
never

faileth
.;
Wherefore
,
cleave
unto
charity
,
which
isthe
greatest
of
all
,
for
all
things
must
fail
;
but
charity
is
the
pure
love
of
Christ
and
it
endureth
forever
;
and
whoso
is
found
possessed
of
it
at
the
last
day
,
it
shall
be
well
with
them
.
Wherefore
,
my
beloved
.
brethren
,
pray
unto
the
Father
with
all
the
energy
of
heart
,
that
ye
may
be
filled
with
this
love
which
he
hath
bestowed
upon
all
who
are
true
followers
of
his
Son
Jesus
Chriat
,
that
ye
may
become
the
sons
of
God
,
that
when
he
shall
appear
,
we
shall
be
like
him
;
for
we
shall
-
see
him
as
he
is
,
that
we
may
have
this
hope
,
that
we
may
be
purified
even
ashe
is
pure
.
Amen

CHAPTER
VIII
.
An
epistle
of
my
father
Mormon
,
written
to
me
Moroni
;
and
it
was
written
unto
me
soon
after
my
calling
to
the
ministry
.
And
on
this
wise
did
he
write
unto
me
,
saying
,
my
belovedson
Moroni
,
[
rejoice
exceedingly
that
your
Lord
Jesus
Christ
hath
been
mindful
of
you
,
and
hath
called
you
to
his
ministry
,
and
to
his
holy
work
.
Iam
mindful
.
of
you
always
in
my
prayers
,
continually
praying
unto
God
the
Father
in
the
name
of
his
holy
Sian
that
he
,
through
his
infinite
goodness
and
grace
,
will
keep
you
through
the
endurance
of
faith
on
his
name
to
the
end
.

And
now
my
son
I
speak
unto
you
concerning
that
which
grieveth
me
exceedingly
;
for
it
:
grieveth
:
me
that
there
should
disputations
rise
.
among
you
.
For
if
Thave
-
learned
the
truth
,
there
has
been
:
disputations
among
you
\oncerning
the
:
baptism
.
of
your
little
children
,
And
now
.
my
son
,
1
desire
that
ye
should
labor
diligently
,
that
:
this
gross
error
should
be
removed
fromamong
you
;
for
,
for
this
intent
I
lave
written
this
.
epistle
..
For
immediately
.
after
I
had
learned
__
these
things
of
you
,
inquired
of
the
Lord
concerning
the
matter
.
'
And
the
.
word
of
;
the
Lord
.
came
to
me
by
the
power
-
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
aging
inten
tothe
words
of
Christ
,
:
your'
Redeemer
,
your
Lord
and
your
[File:611]
God
.
Behold
,
I
came
into
the
world
not
to
call
the
righteous
,
but
sinners
to
repentance
;
the
whole
need
no
physician
,
but
they
that
-
are
sick
;
wherefore
little
children
are
whole
,
for
they
.
are
not
capable
of
commit
ting
sin
;
wherefore
the
curse
of
Adam
is
taken
from
them
in
me
,
that
it
hath
no
power
over
them
;
and
the
law
of
circumcision
is
done
away
in
me
,
And
after
this
manner
did
the
Holy
Ghost
manifest
the
word
of
God
unto
me
;
wherefore
my
beloved
son
,
I
know
that
itis
solemn
mockery
before
God
,
that
ye
should
baptize
little
children
.
Behold
Lsay
unto
you
,
that
this
thing
shall
ye
teach
,
repentance
and
baptism
unto
those
who
are
accountable
and
capable
of
committing
sin
;
yea
,
teach
parents
that
they
must
repent
and
be
baptized
,
and
humble
themselves
as
their
little
children
,
and
they
shall
all
be
saved
with
their
little
children
;
and
their
little
children
need
no
repentance
,
neither
baptism
.
Behold
,
baptism
is
unto
repentance
to
the
fulfilling
the
commandments
unto
the
remission
of
sins
.
But
little
children
are
alive
in
Christ
,
even
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
;
if
not
so
,
God
isa
partial
God
,
and
also'a
changable
God
,
and
a
respecter
to
persons
;
for
how
many
little
children
have
died
without
baptism
.
Wherefore
,
if
little
children
couid
not
be
saved
without
baptism
,
these
must
have
gone
to
an
endless
hell
.
Behold
:
I
say
unto
you
,
that'
he
that
supposeth
that
little
children
need
baptism
,
is
in
the
gall
of
bitterness
,
and
in
the
bonds
of
iniquity
;
for
~
he
hath
neither
faith
,
hope
,
nor
charity
;
wherefore
,
should
he
be
cut
off
while
in
the
thought
,
he
must
go
down
(
o
-
hell
.
For
awful
is
the
wickedness
to
suppose
that
God
saveth
one
child
because
of
baptism
,
and
the
other
must
perish
because
he
hath
no
baptism
.
Wo
be
unto
him
that
shall
pervert
the
ways
of
the
Lord
after
this
manner
,
for
they
shall
perish
,
except
they
repent
.
Behold
,
I
speak
with
boldness
,
having
authority
from
God
;
and
I
fear
not
what
man
can
do
;.
for
perfect
love
casteth
out
all
fear
;.
and
I
am
filled
.
with
charity
,
which
is
.
everlasting
:
love
;
wherefore
all
children
arealike
unto
me
;
wherefore
I
love
little
children
with
:
a
perfect
.
love
;.
and
they
are
all
alike
,
and
partakers
of
salvation
...
For
I
.
know
that
.
God
.
is
:
not
a
partial
God
,
neithera
changable
being
;
but
he
is
unchangable
from
all
eternity
to
alleternity
.
Little
children
cannot
repent
;
wherefore
itis
awful
wickedness
to
.
deny
the
pure
mercies
of
God
unto
them
,
for
they
are
all
alive
in
-
him
because
of
his
mercy
.
And
he
that
[File:612]
saith
that
little
children
:
need
baptism
,
denieth
the
mercies
of
Christ
,
and
setteth
at
nought
the
atonement
of
him
and
the
powerof
his
redemption
.
Wo
unto
such
,
for
.
they
.
are
in
danger
of
death
,
-
hell
,
and
an
endless
.
torment
.
I
speak
it
boldly
,
God
hath
ecommanded
me
.
Listen
unto
them
:
and
give
heed
,
or
they
stand
against
-
you
at
the
judgment
seat
of
Christ
..
Por
behold
that
:
all
little
children
are
alive
in
.
Christ
,
and
aiso
all
they
that
are
without
the
law
.
For
the
power
of
redemption
cometh
on
all
they
that
have
no
Jaw
;
wherefore
,
he
that
ig
not
condemned
,
or
he
that
is
under
no
-
condemnation
,
cannot
repent
;
and
unto
such
baptism
availeth
nothing
,
But
it
is
mockery
before
God
,
denying
the
mercies
of
Christ
;
and
the
powerof
his
holy
spirit
,
and
putting
trust
in
dead
works
.
Behold
,
my
son
;
this
thing
ought
not
to
be
;
for
repentance
js
unto
them
.
that
are
under
condemnation
,
and
under
the
curse
of
a
broken
law
.
And
the
first
fruits
of
repentanceis
:
baptism
;
and
baptism
cometh
by
faith
,
unto
the
fulfilling
the
commandments
;
and
the
fulfilling
the
commandments
bringeth
remission
of
sins
;
/and
the
remission
of
sins'bringeth
meekness
,
and
lowliness
of
heart
;
and
because
of
meekness
and
lowliness
of
heart
,
cometh
the
visitation
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
which
comforter
filleth
with
hope
and
:
perfect
love
,
which
Joye
endureth
by
diligence
unto
prayer
,
until
the'
end
-
shali
come
,
when
all
-
the
saints
shall
dwell
with
:
God
.
Behold
;
my
:
son
,
I
will
write
unto
you
again
,
if
I
go
not
out
soon
against
the
Lamanites
..
Behold
,
the
pride
of
this
nation
,
or
-
the
people
of
the
Nephites
;
hath
proven
their
destruction
,
except
they
should
repent
.
~
Pray
for
them
,
my
\son
,
that
repentance
may
come
:
unto
them
.
Â©
But
behold
,
I
fear
lest
the
spirit
hath
ceased
striving
with
:
them
;
and
in
this
part
of
the
land
they
are
also
seeking
to
put
down
all
power
and
:
authority
,
which
cometh
from
God
;
and
they
:
are
denying
the
Holy
Ghost
.
And
after
rejecting
so
-
greata
knowledge
,
my
son
,
they
must
perish
soon
,
unto
the
fulfilling
of
the
prophecies
-
which
were
spoken
by
the
prophets
,
as
well
aa
the
words'of

CHAPTER
IX
,
The
second
cpistle
of
Mormon
to
his
.
son
Moroni
.
My
beloved
son
,
I
write
unto
you
again
,
that
-
ye
may
know
that
I
am
yet
alive
;
but
write
somewhat
that
which
is
grievous
.
For
behold
,
I
have
had
asore
battle
with
the
Lamanites
,
in
which
we
did
-
not
.
conquer
;
and
Archeantus
has
fallen
by
the
sword
,
and
also
;
Luramand
Emron
;
yea
,
and
we
have
lost
agreat
number
of
our
.
choice
men
..
And
now
behold
,
my
son
,
I
fear
lest
the
Lamanites
shall
destroy
this
people
,
for
they
de
not
repent
,
and
satan
stirreth
them
up
continually
to
anger
,
one
with
another
...
Behold
,
1
am
laboring
with
them
continually
;
and
when
I
speak
.
the
word
of
God
with
.
sharpness
,
they
tremble
and
anger
against
me
;
and
when
Luse
no
sharpness
,
they
harden
.
their
hearts
.
against
it
;
wherefore
1
fear
lest
the
spirit
of
the
Lord
hath
ceased
striving
with
them
..
For
so
exceedingly
do
they
anger
,
that
it
seemeth
me
that
they
have
no
fear
of
death
;
and
they
have
lost
their
love
,
one
towards
another
;
and
.
they
thirst
after
blood
and
revenge
continually
...
And
now
my
beloved
-
son
,
notwithstanding
their
hardness
,
let
us
labor
diligently
;
for
if
we
should
cease
to
labor
,
we
should
be
brought
under
condemnation
;
fer
we
have
aabor
to
perform
whilst
.
in
this
tabernacle
of
clay
,
that
we
may
conquer
the
enemy
of
all
righteousness
,
and
rest
our
souls
in
the
kingdom
of
God
.
And
now
I
write
somewhat
concerning
the
sufferings
or
this
people
.
For
according
to
the
knowledge
which
.
I
have
received
from
Amoron
,
behold
,
the
Lamanites
have
many
prisoners
,
which
they
took
from
the
tower
of
Sherrizah
;
and
there
were
men
,
women
and'children
..
And
the
husbands
and
fathers
of
those
women
and
.
children
they
have
slain
;
and
.
they
.
feed
the
women
.
upon
:
the
flesh
of
their
husbands
,..
and
the
children
upon
the
flesh
of
their
fathers
;
and
no
water
,
save
a
little
,
do
they
give
unto
them
.
And
notwith
standing
:
this
:
great
abomination
of
the
Lamanites
,
it
doth
not
-
exceed
that
.
of
our
people
.
in
Moriantum
,.
For
behold
,
many
of
the
daughters
of
the
Lamuanites
have
they
taken
prisoners
;
and
after
depriving
them
of
that
which
was
most
dear
and
precious
above
all
things
,
which
is
chastity
and
virtue
;
and
after
they
had
done
this
thing
;
they
did
murder
them
ina
most
.
cruel
manner
,
torturing
their
bodies
even
unto
death
;
and
after
,
Pee
tye
JOAN
[File:614]
they
have
done
this
,
they
devour
their
flesh
like
unto
wild
beasts
,
because
of
the
hardness
of
their
hearts
;
and
they
do
it
fora
token
of
bravery
.
O
my
beloved
son
,
how
can
a
people
like
this
,
that
are
without
civilization
;
(
and
only
a
few
years
have
passed
away
,
and
they
were
a
civil
and
adelightsome
people
;)
but
O
my
son
,
how
can
a
people
like
this
,
whose
delight
is
in
so
much
abomination
,
how
can
we
expect
that
.
God
will
stay
.
his
hand
in
judgment
against
us
?
Behold
,
my
heart
cries
wo
unto
this
people
.
Come
outsin
judgment
,
O
God
,
and
hide
their
sins
,
and
wickedness
,
and
abominations
from
before
thy
face
.
And
again
,
my
son
,
there
are
many
widows
and
their
daughters
,
who
remain
in
Sherrizah
;
and
that
,
part
of
the
provisions
whick
the
Lamanites
.
did
not
carry
away
,
behold
,
the
army
of
Zenephi
has
carried
away
,
and
left
them
to
wander
whithersoever
they
can
for
food
;
and
many
old
women
do
faint
by
the
way
and
die
.
And
the
army
which
is
with
me
,
is
weak
;
and
the
armies
of
the
Lamanites
are
betwixt
Sherrizah
and
me
;
and
as
many
as
have
fledto
the
army
of
Aaron
,
have
fallen
yvictims
to
their
awful
brutality
.
O
the
depravity
of
my
eople
!
they
are
without
order
and
without
mercy
..
Behold
,
I
am
but
a
man
,
and
I
have
but
.
the
strength
of
.
a
man
,
and
I
cannot
any
longer
enforce
my
commands
;
and
they
haye
become
strong
in
their
perversion
;
and
they
are
alike
brutaly
sparing
none
,
neither
old
nor
young
;
and
they
delight
in
every
thing
save
that
which
is
good
;
and
the
sufferings
of
our
women
and
our
children
upon
:
all
the
face
of
this
land
,
doth
exceed
every
thing
;
yea
,
tongue
cannot
tell
,
neither
can
it
be
written
.
And
now
my'son
,
I
dwell
-
no
longer
upon
this
horrible
scene
.
Behold
,
thou
knowest
the
wickedness
of
this
people
;
thou
knowest
that
they
are
.
without
principle
,
and
past
feeling
;
and
their
wickedness
doth
exceed
that
of
the
Lamanites
,
-
Behold
,
my
son
,
I
cannot
.
recommend
-
them
unto
.
God
lest
be
should
smite
me
.
But
behold
,
my
.
son
,
I
recommend
thee
unto
.
God
,
and
T
trust
.
in
Christ
that
,
thou
wilt
be
saved
;
and
J
pray
unto
God
that
he
would
spare
thy
life
,
to
witness
the
return
of
his
people
unto
him
,
or
their
utter
destruction
;
for
I
know
that
they
must
perish
,
except
they
repent
-
and
return
unto
him
;
and
if
they
perish
it
will
be
like
unto
the
Jaredites
,
because
of
the
wilfulness
of
their
hearts
,
seeking
for
blood
and
-
revenge
.
Andif
it
so
bethat
they
perish
,
.
we
know
that
.
many
of
our
brethren
have
dissented
a
RE
[File:615]
over
unto
the
Lamanites
,
and
many
more
will
also
dissent
over
unto
them
;
wherefore
,
write
somewhat
a
few
things
,
if
thou
art
spared
;
and
I
shall
perish
and
not
see
thee
;
but
I
trust
that
[
may
see
thee
soon
;
for
I
have
sacred
records
that
I
would
deliver
up
unto
thee
.
My
son
,
be
taithful
in
Christ
;
and
may
not
the
things
which
I
have
written
,
grieve
thee
,
to
weigh
thee
down
unto
death
,
but
may
Christ
lift
thee
up
,
and
may
his
sufferings
and
death
,
and
the
shewing
his
body
unto
our
fathers
,
and
his
mercy
and
long
suffering
,
and
the
hope
of
his
glory
and
of
eternal
lif
,
rest
in
your
mind
forever
.
And
may
the
grace
of
God
the
Father
,
whose
throne
is
high
in
the
heavens
,
and
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
,
who
sitteth
on
the
right
hand
of
his
power
,
until
all
things
shall
become
subject
unto
him
,
be
,
and
abide
with
you
forever
.
Amen
.

CHAPTER
X
.
Now
I
,
Moroni
,
write
somewhat
as
seemeth
me
good
;
and
I'write
unto
my
brethren
,
the
Lamanites
;
and
I
would
that
they
should
know
that
more
than
four
hundred
and
twenty
years
have
passed
away
,
since
the
sign
was
given
of
the
coming
of
Christ
..
And
I
seal
up
these
records
,
after
I
have
spoken
a
few
words
by
way
of
exhortation
unto
you
.
Behold
,
I
would
exhort
you
that
when
ye
shall
read
these
things
if
it
be
wisdom
in
God
that
ye
should
read
them
,
that
ye
would
remember
how
merciful
the
Lord
hath
been
unto
the
children
of
men
,
from
the
creation
of
Adam
;
even
down
.
until
the
time
that
ye
shall
receive
these
things
,
and
ponder
it
in
your
hearts
,
And
when
ye
shall
r
receive
these
things
,
I
would
exhort
Jo
that
ye
would
ask
God
,
the
.
eternal
Father
,
in
the
name
of
Christ
,
if
these
things
are
not
true
;
and
if
ye
shall
ask
with
a
sincere
heart
,
with
real
intent
,
having
faith
in
Christ
,
he
will
manifest
the
truth
of
it
unto
you
,
by
the
powerof
the
Holy
Ghost
;
and
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
,
ye
may
know
the
truth
of
all
things
.
And
whatsoever
thing
is
good
,
is
just
and
true
;
wherefore
,
nothing
that
is
good
:
denieth
the
Christ
,
but
acAmowledgeth
that
he
is
.
And
ye
may
know
that
he
Bis
[File:616]
is
,
by
the
power
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;
wherefore
I
would
exhort
you
,
that
ye
deny
not
the
power
of
God
;
for
he
worketh
by
power
,
according
to
the
faith
of
the
children
of
men
,
the
same
to-day
and
to
-
morrow
,
and
forever
.
And
again
IT
exhort
you
,
my
brethren
,
that
ye
deny
not
the
gifts
of
God
,
for
they
are
many
;
and
they
come
from
the
same
God
.
And
there
are
differs
ent
ways
that
these
gifts
are
administered
;.
but
it
is
the
same
God
who
worketh
all
in
all
;
and
they
are
given
by
the
manifestations
of
the
spirit
of
God
unto
men
,
to
profit
them
.
For
behold
,
to
one
is
given
by
the
spirit
of
God
,
that
he
may
teach
the
word
of
wisdom
;
and
to
another
,
that
he
may
teach
the
word
of
knowledge
by
the
same
spirit
;
and
to
another
,
exceeding
great
faith
;
and
to
another
,
the
gifts
of
healing
by
the
same
spirit
.
And
again
,
to
another
,
that
he
may
work
mighty
miracles
;
and
again
,
to
another
that
he
may
prophesy
concerning
all
things
;
and
again
,
to
another
,
the
beholding
of
angels
and
ministering
spirits
;
and
again
,
to
another
,
all
kinds
of
tongues
;
and
again
,
to
another
,
the
interpretation
of
languages
and
af
divers
kinds
of
tongues
.
And
all
these
gifts
come
by
the
spirit
of
Christ
;
and
they
come
unto
every
man
severally
,
according
as
he
will
.
And
I
would'exhort
you
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
that
ye
remember
that
every
good
gift
cometh
of
Christ
.
And
I
would
exhort
you
,
my
beloved
brethren
,
that
ye
remember
that
he
is
the
same
yesterday
,
to-day
,
and
forever
,
and
that
all
these
gifts
of
which
I
have
spoken
,
which
are
spiritual
,
never
will
be
done
away
,
even
as
long
as
the
world
shall
stand
,
only
according
to
the
unbelief
of
the
children
of
men
.
Wherefore
,
there
must
be
faith
;
and
if
there
must
be
faith
,
there
must
also
be
hope
;
and
if
there
must
be
hope
,
there
must
also
be
charity
;
and
except
ye
have
charity
,
ye
can
in
no
wise
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
God
;
neither
can
ye
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
God
,
if
-
ye
have
not
faith
;
neither
can
ye
if
ye
have
no
hope
;
and
if
ye
have
no
hope
,
ye
must
needs
be
in
despair
;
and
despair
cometh
because
,
of
iniquity
.
And
Christ
truly
said
unto
our
fathers
,
if
ye
have
faith
,
ye
can
do
all
things
.
which
is
expedient
unto
me
.
And
now
I
speak
unto
all
the
:
ends
of
the
earth
,
that
if
the
day
cometh
that
the
power
and
gifts
of
God
shall
be
done
away
among
you
,
it
shall
be
because
of
unbelief
.
And
wo
.
be
unto
the
.
children
of
men
,
if
this
be
the
case
;.
for
there
shall
be
none
that
doeth
good
among
you
,
no
not
-
one
.
For
if
there
be
[File:617]
one
among
you
that
doeth
good
,
he
shall
work
by
the
power
and
gifts
of
God
.
And
wounto
them
who
shall
do
these
things
away
and
die
,
for
they
die
in
their
sins
,
and
they
cannot
be
saved
in
the
kingdom
of
God
;
and
I
speak
it
according
to
the
words
of
Christ
,
and
I
lienot
.
And
I
exhort
you
to
remember
these
things
;
for
the
time
speedily
cometh
that
ye
shall
know
that
Tlie
not
,
for
ye
shall
see
me
at
the
bar
of
God
,
and
the
Lord
God
will
say
unto
you
,
did
I
not
declare
my
words
unto
you
,
which
were
written
by
this
man
,
like
as
one
crying
from
the
dead
?
yea
,
even
as
one
speaking
out
of
the
dust
?
I
declare
these
things
unto
.
the
fulfilling
of
the
prophecies
.
And
behold
,
they
.
shall
proceed
forth
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
everlasting
God
;
and
hig
word
shall
hiss
forth
from
generation
to
generation
.
And
God
shall
shew
unto
you
,
that
.
that
which
I
have
written
,
is
true
.
And
again
I
would
exhort
you
,
that
ye
would
come
:
unto
Christ
,
and
lay
hold
upon
every
good
gift
,
and
touch
not
the
evil
gift
,
nor
the
unclean
thing
.
And
awake
,
and
arise
from
the
dust
,
O
:
Jerusalem
;
yea
,
and
put
on
thy
beautiful
garments
,
QO
daughter
of
Zion
,.
and
strengthen
thy
stakes
;
and
enlarge
thy
borders
forever
,
that
thou
mayest
:
no
more
be
confounded
,
that
the
covenants
.
of
the
eternal
Father
which
he
hath
made
unto
thee
,
O
house
of
Israel
,
may
be
fulfilled
.
Yea
,
come
unto
Christ
,
and
he
perfected
in
him
,
and
-
deny
yourselves
of
all
ungodliness
,
and
if
ye
shall
deny
yourselves
of
all
ungodliness
,
and
love
God
with
all
your
might
,
mind
and
strength
,
then
is
his
grace
sufficient
for
you
,
amg
A
his
grace
ye
may
be
perfect
in
Christ
;
and
if
by
grace
of
God
ye
are
perfect
in
Christ
,
ye
can
in
no
wise
deny
the
power
of
God
.
And
again
,
if
ye
,
by
the
grace
of
God
are
perfect
in
Christ
,
and
deny
not
his
power
,
then
are
ye
sanctified
in
Christ
by
the
race
of
God
,
through
the
shedding
of
the
blood
of
Ghrist
,
which
is
in
the
covenant
of
the
Father
,
unto
the
remission
of
your
sins
,
that
ye
become
holy
without
spot
.
And
now
I
bid
unto
all
,
farewell
.
.
I
soon
to
rest
in
the
paradise
of
God
,
until
my
spirit
and
Paty
shall
again
reunite
,
and
I
am
brought
forth
triumphant
through
the
air
,
to
meet
you
before
the
pleasing
bar
of
the
great
Jehovah
,
the
eternal
Judge
of
both
_
Quick
and
dead
.
Amen
.
