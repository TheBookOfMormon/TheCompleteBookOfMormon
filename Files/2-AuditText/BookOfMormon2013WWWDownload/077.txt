14 Awake! and arise from the dust,
and hear the words of a trembling
parent, whose limbs ye must soon
lay down in the cold and silent
grave, from whence no traveler
can return; a few more days and
I go the way of all the earth.

15 But behold, the Lord hath redeemed
my soul from hell; I have
beheld his glory, and I am encircled
about eternally in the arms of his
love.

16 And I desire that ye should remember
to observe the statutes and
the judgments of the Lord; behold,
this hath been the anxiety of my
soul from the beginning.

17 My heart hath been weighed
down with sorrow from time to
time, for I have feared, lest for the
hardness of your hearts the Lord
your God should come out in the
fulness of his wrath upon you, that
ye be cut off and destroyed forever;

may not come down into captivity;

22 That ye may not be cursed with
a sore cursing; and also, that ye may
not incur the displeasure of a just
God upon you, unto the destruction,
yea, the eternal destruction of both
soul and body.

23 Awake, my sons; put on the armor
of righteousness. Shake off the
chains with which ye are bound,
and come forth out of obscurity,
and arise from the dust.

24 Rebel no more against your
brother, whose views have been
glorious, and who hath kept the
commandments from the time that
we left Jerusalem; and who hath
been an instrument in the hands of
God, in bringing us forth into the
land of promise; for were it not for
