understand the remainder of my
words which I shall speak unto you.

5 For behold, if the knowledge of
the goodness of God at this time has
awakened you to a sense of your
nothingness, and your worthless
and fallen state—

6 I say unto you, if ye have come
to a knowledge of the goodness of
God, and his matchless power, and
his wisdom, and his patience, and his
long-suffering towards the children
of men; and also, the atonement
which has been prepared from the
foundation of the world, that thereby
salvation might come to him that
should put his trust in the Lord,
and should be diligent in keeping his
commandments, and continue in the
faith even unto the end of his life, I
mean the life of the mortal body—

7 I say, that this is the man who
receiveth salvation, through the
atonement which was prepared
from the foundation of the world for
all mankind, which ever were since
the fall of Adam, or who are, or who
ever shall be, even unto the end of
the world.

8 And this is the means whereby
salvation cometh. And there is none
other salvation save this which hath
been spoken of; neither are there
any conditions whereby man can be
saved except the conditions which
I have told you.

9 Believe in God; believe that he
is, and that he created all things,
both in heaven and in earth; believe
that he has all wisdom, and all

heart that he would forgive you;
and now, if you believe all these
things see that ye do them.

11 And again I say unto you as I
have said before, that as ye have
come to the knowledge of the glory
of God, or if ye have known of his
goodness and have tasted of his
love, and have received a remission
of your sins, which causeth
such exceedingly great joy in your
souls, even so I would that ye should
remember, and always retain in remembrance,
the greatness of God,
and your own nothingness, and
his goodness and long-suffering
towards you, unworthy creatures,
and humble yourselves even in the
depths of humility, calling on the
name of the Lord daily, and standing
steadfastly in the faith of that
which is to come, which was spoken
by the mouth of the angel.

12 And behold, I say unto you that
if ye do this ye shall always rejoice,
and be filled with the love of God,
and always retain a remission of
your sins; and ye shall grow in the
knowledge of the glory of him that
created you, or in the knowledge of
that which is just and true.

13 And ye will not have a mind
to injure one another, but to live
peaceably, and to render to every
