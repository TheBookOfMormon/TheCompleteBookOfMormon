head with his own sword, I took the
garments of Laban and put them
upon mine own body; yea, even
every whit; and I did gird on his
armor about my loins.

20 And after I had done this, I went
forth unto the treasury of Laban.
And as I went forth towards the
treasury of Laban, behold, I saw the
servant of Laban who had the keys
of the treasury. And I commanded
him in the voice of Laban, that he
should go with me into the treasury.

21 And he supposed me to be his
master, Laban, for he beheld the
garments and also the sword girded
about my loins.

22 And he spake unto me concerning
the elders of the Jews, he
knowing that his master, Laban,
had been out by night among them.

23 And I spake unto him as if it
had been Laban.

24 And I also spake unto him that I
should carry the engravings, which
were upon the plates of brass, to
my elder brethren, who were without
the walls.

25 And I also bade him that he
should follow me.

26 And he, supposing that I spake
of the brethren of the church, and
that I was truly that Laban whom
I had slain, wherefore he did follow
me.

27 And he spake unto me many
times concerning the elders of the
Jews, as I went forth unto my brethren,
who were without the walls.

28 And it came to pass that when
Laman saw me he was exceedingly
frightened, and also Lemuel and
Sam. And they fled from before
my presence; for they supposed it
was Laban, and that he had slain
me and had sought to take away
their lives also.

29 And it came to pass that I called
after them, and they did hear me;
wherefore they did cease to flee
from my presence.

30 And it came to pass that when
the servant of Laban beheld my
brethren he began to tremble, and
was about to flee from before me
and return to the city of Jerusalem.

31 And now I, Nephi, being a man
large in stature, and also having received
much strength of the Lord,
therefore I did seize upon the servant
of Laban, and held him, that
he should not flee.

32 And it came to pass that I spake
with him, that if he would hearken
unto my words, as the Lord liveth,
and as I live, even so that if he would
hearken unto our words, we would
spare his life.

33 And I spake unto him, even
with an oath, that he need not fear;
that he should be a free man like
unto us if he would go down in the
wilderness with us.

34 And I also spake unto him,
saying: Surely the Lord hath commanded
us to do this thing; and shall
we not be diligent in keeping the
commandments of the Lord? Therefore,
if thou wilt go down into the
wilderness to my father thou shalt
have place with us.

35 And it came to pass that Zoram
did take courage at the words which
I spake. Now Zoram was the name of
the servant; and he promised that he
would go down into the wilderness
unto our father. Yea, and he also
made an oath unto us that he would
tarry with us from that time forth.

36 Now we were desirous that he
should tarry with us for this cause,
that the Jews might not know concerning
our flight into the wilderness,
lest they should pursue us and
destroy us.

37 And it came to pass that when
