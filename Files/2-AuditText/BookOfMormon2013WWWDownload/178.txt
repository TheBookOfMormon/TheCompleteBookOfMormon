man according to that which is
his due.

14 And ye will not suffer your
children that they go hungry, or
naked; neither will ye suffer that
they transgress the laws of God, and
fight and quarrel one with another,
and serve the devil, who is the master
of sin, or who is the evil spirit
which hath been spoken of by our
fathers, he being an enemy to all
righteousness.

15 But ye will teach them to walk
in the ways of truth and soberness;
ye will teach them to love one another,
and to serve one another.

16 And also, ye yourselves will
succor those that stand in need of
your succor; ye will administer
of your substance unto him that
standeth in need; and ye will not
suffer that the beggar putteth up
his petition to you in vain, and turn
him out to perish.

17 Perhaps thou shalt say: The
man has brought upon himself his
misery; therefore I will stay my
hand, and will not give unto him
of my food, nor impart unto him of
my substance that he may not suffer,
for his punishments are justâ€”

18 But I say unto you, O man,
whosoever doeth this the same hath
great cause to repent; and except
he repenteth of that which he hath
done he perisheth forever, and hath
no interest in the kingdom of God.

19 For behold, are we not all beggars?
Do we not all depend upon
the same Being, even God, for all
the substance which we have, for
both food and raiment, and for gold,
and for silver, and for all the riches
which we have of every kind?

20 And behold, even at this time,
ye have been calling on his name,
and begging for a remission of your
sins. And has he suffered that ye
have begged in vain? Nay; he has
poured out his Spirit upon you, and
has caused that your hearts should
be filled with joy, and has caused
that your mouths should be stopped
that ye could not find utterance,
so exceedingly great was your joy.

21 And now, if God, who has created
you, on whom you are dependent
for your lives and for all that
ye have and are, doth grant unto
you whatsoever ye ask that is right,
in faith, believing that ye shall receive,
O then, how ye ought to impart
of the substance that ye have
one to another.

22 And if ye judge the man who
putteth up his petition to you for
your substance that he perish not,
and condemn him, how much more
just will be your condemnation for
withholding your substance, which
doth not belong to you but to God,
to whom also your life belongeth;
and yet ye put up no petition, nor
repent of the thing which thou
hast done.

23 I say unto you, wo be unto that
man, for his substance shall perish
with him; and now, I say these things
unto those who are rich as pertaining
to the things of this world.

24 And again, I say unto the poor,
ye who have not and yet have sufficient,
that ye remain from day
to day; I mean all you who deny
