many miracles among the children
of men, how is it that he cannot instruct
me, that I should build a ship?

52 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, said many things unto my
brethren, insomuch that they were
confounded and could not contend
against me; neither durst they lay
their hands upon me nor touch
me with their fingers, even for
the space of many days. Now they
durst not do this lest they should
wither before me, so powerful was
the Spirit of God; and thus it had
wrought upon them.

53 And it came to pass that the
Lord said unto me: Stretch forth
thine hand again unto thy brethren,
and they shall not wither before
thee, but I will shock them,
saith the Lord, and this will I do,
that they may know that I am the
Lord their God.

54 And it came to pass that I
stretched forth my hand unto my
brethren, and they did not wither
before me; but the Lord did shake
them, even according to the word
which he had spoken.

55 And now, they said: We know
of a surety that the Lord is with
thee, for we know that it is the
power of the Lord that has shaken
us. And they fell down before me,
and were about to worship me, but
I would not suffer them, saying: I am
thy brother, yea, even thy younger
brother; wherefore, worship the
Lord thy God, and honor thy father
and thy mother, that thy days may
be long in the land which the Lord
thy God shall give thee.

CHAPTER 18

The ship is finished—The births of Jacob
and Joseph are mentioned—The
company embarks for the promised
land—The sons of Ishmael and their
wives join in revelry and rebellion—
Nephi is bound, and the ship is driven
back by a terrible tempest—Nephi
is freed, and by his prayer the storm
ceases—The people arrive in the promised
land. About 591-589 B.C.

And it came to pass that they did
worship the Lord, and did go forth
with me; and we did work timbers
of curious workmanship. And the
Lord did show me from time to time
after what manner I should work
the timbers of the ship.

2 Now I, Nephi, did not work the
timbers after the manner which
was learned by men, neither did
I build the ship after the manner
of men; but I did build it after the
manner which the Lord had shown
unto me; wherefore, it was not after
the manner of men.

3 And I, Nephi, did go into the
mount oft, and I did pray oft unto
the Lord; wherefore the Lord showed
unto me great things.

4 And it came to pass that after I had
finished the ship, according to the
word of the Lord, my brethren beheld
that it was good, and that the workmanship
thereof was exceedingly
fine; wherefore, they did humble
themselves again before the Lord.

5 And it came to pass that the voice
of the Lord came unto my father,
that we should arise and go down
into the ship.

6 And it came to pass that on the
morrow, after we had prepared all
things, much fruits and meat from
the wilderness, and honey in abundance,
and provisions according
to that which the Lord had commanded
us, we did go down into the
ship, with all our loading and our
