ye are only in the service of your
God.

18 Behold, ye have called me your
king; and if I, whom ye call your king,
do labor to serve you, then ought
not ye to labor to serve one another?

19 And behold also, if I, whom
ye call your king, who has spent
his days in your service, and yet
has been in the service of God, do
merit any thanks from you, O how
you ought to thank your heavenly
King!

20 I say unto you, my brethren, that
if you should render all the thanks
and praise which your whole soul
has power to possess, to that God
who has created you, and has kept
and preserved you, and has caused
that ye should rejoice, and has
granted that ye should live in peace
one with another—

21 I say unto you that if ye should
serve him who has created you
from the beginning, and is preserving
you from day to day, by
lending you breath, that ye may
live and move and do according to
your own will, and even supporting
you from one moment to another—I
say, if ye should serve him with all
your whole souls yet ye would be
unprofitable servants.

22 And behold, all that he requires
of you is to keep his commandments;
and he has promised
you that if ye would keep his commandments
ye should prosper in the
land; and he never doth vary from
that which he hath said; therefore,
if ye do keep his commandments
he doth bless you and prosper you.

23 And now, in the first place, he
hath created you, and granted unto
you your lives, for which ye are indebted
unto him.

24 And secondly, he doth require
that ye should do as he hath commanded
you; for which if ye do, he
doth immediately bless you; and
therefore he hath paid you. And
ye are still indebted unto him, and
are, and will be, forever and ever;
therefore, of what have ye to boast?

25 And now I ask, can ye say aught
of yourselves? I answer you, Nay.
Ye cannot say that ye are even as
much as the dust of the earth; yet
ye were created of the dust of the
earth; but behold, it belongeth to
him who created you.

26 And I, even I, whom ye call
your king, am no better than ye
yourselves are; for I am also of the
dust. And ye behold that I am old,
and am about to yield up this mortal
frame to its mother earth.

27 Therefore, as I said unto you that I
had served you, walking with a clear
conscience before God, even so I at
this time have caused that ye should
assemble yourselves together, that I
might be found blameless, and that
your blood should not come upon
me, when I shall stand to be judged
of God of the things whereof he hath
commanded me concerning you.

28 I say unto you that I have
caused that ye should assemble
yourselves together that I might
