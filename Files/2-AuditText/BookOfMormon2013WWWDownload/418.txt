Holy One—yea, and this because of
their ease, and their exceedingly
great prosperity.

3 And thus we see that except the
Lord doth chasten his people with
many afflictions, yea, except he doth
visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with all
manner of pestilence, they will not
remember him.

4 O how foolish, and how vain,
and how evil, and devilish, and how
quick to do iniquity, and how slow
to do good, are the children of men;
yea, how quick to hearken unto the
words of the evil one, and to set
their hearts upon the vain things of
the world!

5 Yea, how quick to be lifted up
in pride; yea, how quick to boast,
and do all manner of that which is
iniquity; and how slow are they to
remember the Lord their God, and
to give ear unto his counsels, yea,
how slow to walk in wisdom's paths!

6 Behold, they do not desire that
the Lord their God, who hath created them, should rule and reign
over them; notwithstanding his
great goodness and his mercy towards them, they do set at naught
his counsels, and they will not that
he should be their guide.

7 O how great is the nothingness of
the children of men; yea, even they
are less than the dust of the earth.

8 For behold, the dust of the earth
moveth hither and thither, to the
dividing asunder, at the command
of our great and everlasting God.

9 Yea, behold at his voice do the
hills and the mountains tremble
and quake.

10 And by the power of his voice
they are broken up, and become
smooth, yea, even like unto a valley.

11 Yea, by the power of his voice
doth the whole earth shake;

12 Yea, by the power of his voice,
do the foundations rock, even to
the very center.

13 Yea, and if he say unto the
earth—Move—it is moved.

14 Yea, if he say unto the earth—
Thou shalt go back, that it lengthen
out the day for many hours—it is
done;

15 And thus, according to his
word the earth goeth back, and it
appeareth unto man that the sun
standeth still; yea, and behold, this
is so; for surely it is the earth that
moveth and not the sun.

16 And behold, also, if he say unto
the waters of the great deep—Be
thou dried up—it is done.

17 Behold, if he say unto this
mountain—Be thou raised up, and
come over and fall upon that city,
that it be buried up—behold it is
done.

18 And behold, if a man hide up a
treasure in the earth, and the Lord
shall say—Let it be accursed, because of the iniquity of him who
hath hid it up—behold, it shall be
accursed.

19 And if the Lord shall say—Be
thou accursed, that no man shall
find thee from this time henceforth
and forever—behold, no man getteth
it henceforth and forever.
