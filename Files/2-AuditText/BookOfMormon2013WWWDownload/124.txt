him, by the power of the Holy
Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kindred,
tongue, and people, working
mighty miracles, signs, and wonders,
among the children of men
according to their faith.

14 But behold, I prophesy unto
you concerning the last days; concerning
the days when the Lord
God shall bring these things forth
unto the children of men.

15 After my seed and the seed of
my brethren shall have dwindled
in unbelief, and shall have been
smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after
the Lord God shall have camped
against them round about, and shall
have laid siege against them with
a mount, and raised forts against
them; and after they shall have been
brought down low in the dust, even
that they are not, yet the words of
the righteous shall be written, and
the prayers of the faithful shall
be heard, and all those who have
dwindled in unbelief shall not be
forgotten.

16 For those who shall be destroyed
shall speak unto them out of the
ground, and their speech shall be
low out of the dust, and their voice
shall be as one that hath a familiar

dwindled in unbelief shall not
have them, for they seek to destroy
the things of God.

18 Wherefore, as those who have
been destroyed have been destroyed
speedily; and the multitude of their
terrible ones shall be as chaff that
passeth away—yea, thus saith the
Lord God: It shall be at an instant,
suddenly—

19 And it shall come to pass, that
those who have dwindled in unbelief
shall be smitten by the hand
of the Gentiles.

20 And the Gentiles are lifted up
in the pride of their eyes, and have
stumbled, because of the greatness
of their stumbling block, that they
have built up many churches; nevertheless,
they put down the power
and miracles of God, and preach up
unto themselves their own wisdom
and their own learning, that they
may get gain and grind upon the
face of the poor.

21 And there are many churches
built up which cause envyings,
and strifes, and malice.

22 And there are also secret combinations,
even as in times of old,
according to the combinations of
the devil, for he is the founder of
