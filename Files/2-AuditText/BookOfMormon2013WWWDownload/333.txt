14 Therefore, my son, see that you
are merciful unto your brethren;
deal justly, judge righteously, and
do good continually; and if ye do
all these things then shall ye receive
your reward; yea, ye shall have
mercy restored unto you again;
ye shall have justice restored unto
you again; ye shall have a righteous
judgment restored unto you again;
and ye shall have good rewarded
unto you again.

15 For that which ye do send out
shall return unto you again, and be
restored; therefore, the word restoration more fully condemneth
the sinner, and justifieth him not
at all.

CHAPTER 42

Mortality is a probationary time to enable man to
repent and serve God—The
Fall brought temporal and spiritual
death upon all mankind—Redemption
comes through repentance—God Himself
atones for the sins of the world—Mercy
is for those who repent—All others are
subject to God's justice—Mercy comes
because of the Atonement—Only the
truly penitent are saved. About 74 B.C.

And now, my son, I perceive there
is somewhat more which doth
worry your mind, which ye cannot
understand—which is concerning
the justice of God in the punishment of the sinner; for ye do try
to suppose that it is injustice that
the sinner should be consigned to
a state of misery.

2 Now behold, my son, I will explain
this thing unto thee. For behold,
after the Lord God sent our first
parents forth from the garden of
Eden, to till the ground, from
whence they were taken—yea, he
drew out the man, and he placed at
the east end of the garden of Eden,
cherubim, and a flaming sword
which turned every way, to keep the
tree of life—

3 Now, we see that the man had
become as God, knowing good and
evil; and lest he should put forth
his hand, and take also of the tree
of life, and eat and live forever, the
Lord God placed cherubim and the
flaming sword, that he should not
partake of the fruit—

4 And thus we see, that there was
a time granted unto man to repent,
yea, a probationary time, a time to
repent and serve God.

5 For behold, if Adam had put forth
his hand immediately, and partaken of the tree of life, he would
have lived forever, according to the
word of God, having no space for
repentance; yea, and also the word
of God would have been void, and
the great plan of salvation would
have been frustrated.

6 But behold, it was appointed
unto man to die—therefore, as
they were cut off from the tree of
life they should be cut off from
the face of the earth—and man became lost forever, yea, they became
fallen man.

7 And now, ye see by this that
our first parents were cut off both
temporally and spiritually from the
presence of the Lord; and thus we
see they became subjects to follow
after their own will.

8 Now behold, it was not expedient
