before our eyes, that even our
fathers would have dwindled in
unbelief, and we should have been
like unto our brethren, the Lamanites,
who know nothing concerning
these things, or even do not believe
them when they are taught them,
because of the traditions of their
fathers, which are not correct.

6 O my sons, I would that ye should
remember that these sayings are
true, and also that these records
are true. And behold, also the plates
of Nephi, which contain the records
and the sayings of our fathers from
the time they left Jerusalem until
now, and they are true; and we can
know of their surety because we
have them before our eyes.

7 And now, my sons, I would that
ye should remember to search
them diligently, that ye may profit
thereby; and I would that ye should
keep the commandments of God,
that ye may prosper in the land
according to the promises which
the Lord made unto our fathers.

8 And many more things did king
Benjamin teach his sons, which are
not written in this book.

9 And it came to pass that after
king Benjamin had made an end
of teaching his sons, that he waxed
old, and he saw that he must very
soon go the way of all the earth;
therefore, he thought it expedient
that he should confer the kingdom
upon one of his sons.

10 Therefore, he had Mosiah
brought before him; and these are
the words which he spake unto
him, saying: My son, I would that
ye should make a proclamation
throughout all this land among all
this people, or the people of Zarahemla,
and the people of Mosiah
who dwell in the land, that thereby
they may be gathered together; for
on the morrow I shall proclaim unto
this my people out of mine own
mouth that thou art a king and a
ruler over this people, whom the
Lord our God hath given us.

11 And moreover, I shall give this
people a name, that thereby they
may be distinguished above all the
people which the Lord God hath
brought out of the land of Jerusalem;
and this I do because they have
been a diligent people in keeping
the commandments of the Lord.

12 And I give unto them a name
that never shall be blotted out, except
it be through transgression.

13 Yea, and moreover I say unto
you, that if this highly favored
people of the Lord should fall into
transgression, and become a wicked
and an adulterous people, that the
Lord will deliver them up, that
thereby they become weak like
unto their brethren; and he will no
more preserve them by his matchless
and marvelous power, as he
has hitherto preserved our fathers.

14 For I say unto you, that if he
had not extended his arm in the
preservation of our fathers they
must have fallen into the hands of
the Lamanites, and become victims
to their hatred.

15 And it came to pass that after
king Benjamin had made an end
of these sayings to his son, that he
gave him charge concerning all
the affairs of the kingdom.

16 And moreover, he also gave him
charge concerning the records which
