exalt my throne above the stars of
God; I will sit also upon the mount
of the congregation, in the sides of
the north;

14 I will ascend above the heights
of the clouds; I will be like the
Most High.

15 Yet thou shalt be brought down
to hell, to the sides of the pit.

16 They that see thee shall narrowly
look upon thee, and shall
consider thee, and shall say: Is this
the man that made the earth to
tremble, that did shake kingdoms?

17 And made the world as a wilderness,
and destroyed the cities
thereof, and opened not the house
of his prisoners?

18 All the kings of the nations, yea,
all of them, lie in glory, every one
of them in his own house.

19 But thou art cast out of thy
grave like an abominable branch,
and the remnant of those that are
slain, thrust through with a sword,
that go down to the stones of the
pit; as a carcass trodden under feet.

20 Thou shalt not be joined with
them in burial, because thou hast
destroyed thy land and slain thy
people; the seed of evil-doers
shall never be renowned.

21 Prepare slaughter for his children
for the iniquities of their
fathers, that they do not rise, nor
possess the land, nor fill the face
of the world with cities.

22 For I will rise up against them,
saith the Lord of Hosts, and cut off
from Babylon the name, and remnant,
and son, and nephew, saith
the Lord.

23 I will also make it a possession
for the bittern, and pools of water;
and I will sweep it with the besom of
destruction, saith the Lord of Hosts.

24 The Lord of Hosts hath sworn,
saying: Surely as I have thought, so
shall it come to pass; and as I have
purposed, so shall it stand—

25 That I will bring the Assyrian in
my land, and upon my mountains
tread him under foot; then shall his
yoke depart from off them, and
his burden depart from off their
shoulders.

26 This is the purpose that is purposed
upon the whole earth; and
this is the hand that is stretched
out upon all nations.

27 For the Lord of Hosts hath purposed,
and who shall disannul? And
his hand is stretched out, and who
shall turn it back?

28 In the year that king Ahaz died
was this burden.

29 Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina,
because the rod of him that
smote thee is broken; for out of
the serpent's root shall come forth
a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be
a fiery flying serpent.

30 And the firstborn of the poor
shall feed, and the needy shall lie
down in safety; and I will kill thy
root with famine, and he shall slay
thy remnant.

31 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou,
whole Palestina, art dissolved; for
there shall come from the north a
smoke, and none shall be alone in
his appointed times.

32 What shall then answer the
messengers of the nations? That
the Lord hath founded Zion, and
the poor of his people shall trust
in it.

prophecies will be understood in the
last days—The Jews will return from
Babylon, crucify the Messiah, and be
