they were changed from this body
of flesh into an immortal state,
that they could behold the things
of God.

16 But it came to pass that they
did again minister upon the face
of the earth; nevertheless they did
not minister of the things which
they had heard and seen, because
of the commandment which was
given them in heaven.

17 And now, whether they were
mortal or immortal, from the day
of their transfiguration, I know not;

18 But this much I know, according to the record which hath been
givenâ€”they did go forth upon the
face of the land, and did minister
unto all the people, uniting as many
to the church as would believe in
their preaching; baptizing them,
and as many as were baptized did
receive the Holy Ghost.

19 And they were cast into prison
by them who did not belong to the
church. And the prisons could not
hold them, for they were rent in
twain.

20 And they were cast down into
the earth; but they did smite the
earth with the word of God, insomuch that by his power they were
delivered out of the depths of the
earth; and therefore they could not
dig pits sufficient to hold them.

21 And thrice they were cast into
a furnace and received no harm.

22 And twice were they cast into
a den of wild beasts; and behold
they did play with the beasts as a
child with a suckling lamb, and received no harm.

23 And it came to pass that thus
they did go forth among all the
people of Nephi, and did preach
the gospel of Christ unto all people upon the face of the land; and
they were converted unto the Lord,
and were united unto the church of
Christ, and thus the people of that
generation were blessed, according
to the word of Jesus.

24 And now I, Mormon, make an
end of speaking concerning these
things for a time.

25 Behold, I was about to write the
names of those who were never to
taste of death, but the Lord forbade;
therefore I write them not, for they
are hid from the world.

26 But behold, I have seen them,
and they have ministered unto me.

27 And behold they will be among
the Gentiles, and the Gentiles shall
know them not.

28 They will also be among the
Jews, and the Jews shall know
them not.

29 And it shall come to pass, when
the Lord seeth fit in his wisdom
that they shall minister unto all the
scattered tribes of Israel, and unto
all nations, kindreds, tongues and
people, and shall bring out of them
unto Jesus many souls, that their
desire may be fulfilled, and also
because of the convincing power
of God which is in them.

30 And they are as the angels of
God, and if they shall pray unto the
Father in the name of Jesus they can
show themselves unto whatsoever
man it seemeth them good.

31 Therefore, great and marvelous
works shall be wrought by them,
before the great and coming day
when all people must surely stand
before the judgment-seat of Christ;

32 Yea even among the Gentiles
shall there be a great and marvelous work wrought by them, before
that judgment day.

33 And if ye had all the scriptures
which give an account of all the
