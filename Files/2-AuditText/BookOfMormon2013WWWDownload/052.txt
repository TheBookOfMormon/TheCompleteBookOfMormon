24 And behold, the things which
this apostle of the Lamb shall write
are many things which thou hast
seen; and behold, the remainder
shalt thou see.

25 But the things which thou shalt
see hereafter thou shalt not write;
for the Lord God hath ordained the
apostle of the Lamb of God that he
should write them.

26 And also others who have been,
to them hath he shown all things,
and they have written them; and
they are sealed up to come forth in
their purity, according to the truth
which is in the Lamb, in the own
due time of the Lord, unto the house
of Israel.

27 And I, Nephi, heard and bear
record, that the name of the apostle
of the Lamb was John, according
to the word of the angel.

28 And behold, I, Nephi, am forbidden
that I should write the remainder
of the things which I saw
and heard; wherefore the things
which I have written sufficeth me;
and I have written but a small part
of the things which I saw.

29 And I bear record that I saw
the things which my father saw,
and the angel of the Lord did make
them known unto me.

30 And now I make an end of
speaking concerning the things
which I saw while I was carried
away in the Spirit; and if all the
things which I saw are not written,
the things which I have written are
true. And thus it is. Amen.

CHAPTER 15

Lehi's seed are to receive the gospel from
the Gentiles in the latter days—The
gathering of Israel is likened unto an
olive tree whose natural branches will be
grafted in again—Nephi interprets the
vision of the tree of life and speaks of
the justice of God in dividing the wicked
from the righteous. About 600-592 B.C.

And it came to pass that after I,
Nephi, had been carried away in
the Spirit, and seen all these things,
I returned to the tent of my father.

2 And it came to pass that I beheld
my brethren, and they were disputing
one with another concerning
the things which my father had
spoken unto them.

3 For he truly spake many great
things unto them, which were hard
to be understood, save a man should
inquire of the Lord; and they being
hard in their hearts, therefore
they did not look unto the Lord as
they ought.

4 And now I, Nephi, was grieved
because of the hardness of their
hearts, and also, because of the
things which I had seen, and knew
they must unavoidably come to
pass because of the great wickedness
of the children of men.

5 And it came to pass that I was
overcome because of my afflictions,
for I considered that mine afflictions
were great above all, because
of the destruction of my people,
for I had beheld their fall.

6 And it came to pass that after I
had received strength I spake unto
my brethren, desiring to know of
them the cause of their disputations.

7 And they said: Behold, we cannot
understand the words which our
father hath spoken concerning the
natural branches of the olive tree,
and also concerning the Gentiles.

8 And I said unto them: Have ye
inquired of the Lord?
