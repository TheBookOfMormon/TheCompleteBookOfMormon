punishment affixed, and a repentance granted; which repentance,
mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice
claimeth the creature and executeth
the law, and the law inflicteth the
punishment; if not so, the works
of justice would be destroyed, and
God would cease to be God.

23 But God ceaseth not to be God,
and mercy claimeth the penitent,
and mercy cometh because of the
atonement; and the atonement
bringeth to pass the resurrection of
the dead; and the resurrection
of the dead bringeth back men
into the presence of God; and thus
they are restored into his presence,
to be judged according to their
works, according to the law and
justice.

24 For behold, justice exerciseth
all his demands, and also mercy
claimeth all which is her own; and
thus, none but the truly penitent
are saved.

25 What, do ye suppose that mercy
can rob justice? I say unto you,
Nay; not one whit. If so, God would
cease to be God.

26 And thus God bringeth about
his great and eternal purposes,
which were prepared from the
foundation of the world. And thus
cometh about the salvation and the
redemption of men, and also their
destruction and misery.

27 Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may come and partake of the waters of life freely;
and whosoever will not come the
same is not compelled to come; but
in the last day it shall be restored
unto him according to his deeds.

28 If he has desired to do evil,
and has not repented in his days,
behold, evil shall be done unto him,
according to the restoration of God.

29 And now, my son, I desire that
ye should let these things trouble
you no more, and only let your
sins trouble you, with that trouble
which shall bring you down unto
repentance.

30 O my son, I desire that ye should
deny the justice of God no more. Do
not endeavor to excuse yourself in
the least point because of your sins,
by denying the justice of God; but
do you let the justice of God, and
his mercy, and his long-suffering
have full sway in your heart; and
let it bring you down to the dust
in humility.

31 And now, O my son, ye are
called of God to preach the word
unto this people. And now, my son,
go thy way, declare the word with
truth and soberness, that thou mayest bring souls unto repentance,
that the great plan of mercy may
have claim upon them. And may
God grant unto you even according
to my words. Amen.
