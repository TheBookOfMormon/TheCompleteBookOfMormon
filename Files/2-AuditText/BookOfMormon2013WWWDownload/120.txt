generation according to their iniquities;
and never hath any of
them been destroyed save it were
foretold them by the prophets of
the Lord.

10 Wherefore, it hath been told
them concerning the destruction
which should come upon them, immediately
after my father left Jerusalem;
nevertheless, they hardened
their hearts; and according to my
prophecy they have been destroyed,
save it be those which are carried
away captive into Babylon.

11 And now this I speak because
of the spirit which is in me. And
notwithstanding they have been
carried away they shall return
again, and possess the land of Jerusalem;
wherefore, they shall be
restored again to the land of their
inheritance.

12 But, behold, they shall have
wars, and rumors of wars; and when
the day cometh that the Only Begotten
of the Father, yea, even the
Father of heaven and of earth, shall
manifest himself unto them in the
flesh, behold, they will reject him,
because of their iniquities, and the
hardness of their hearts, and the
stiffness of their necks.

13 Behold, they will crucify him;
and after he is laid in a sepulchre
for the space of three days he shall
rise from the dead, with healing in
his wings; and all those who shall
believe on his name shall be saved
in the kingdom of God. Wherefore,
my soul delighteth to prophesy concerning
him, for I have seen his
day, and my heart doth magnify
his holy name.

14 And behold it shall come to
pass that after the Messiah hath
risen from the dead, and hath
manifested himself unto his people,
unto as many as will believe on
his name, behold, Jerusalem shall
be destroyed again; for wo unto
them that fight against God and
the people of his church.

15 Wherefore, the Jews shall be
scattered among all nations; yea,
and also Babylon shall be destroyed;
wherefore, the Jews shall be
scattered by other nations.

16 And after they have been
scattered, and the Lord God hath
scourged them by other nations
for the space of many generations,
yea, even down from generation to
generation until they shall be persuaded
to believe in Christ, the Son
of God, and the atonement, which
is infinite for all mankindâ€”and
when that day shall come that they
shall believe in Christ, and worship
the Father in his name, with pure
hearts and clean hands, and look
not forward any more for another
Messiah, then, at that time, the day
will come that it must needs be expedient
that they should believe
these things.

17 And the Lord will set his hand
