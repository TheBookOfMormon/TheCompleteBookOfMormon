have, except he should possess the
power of God, which no man can;
yet a man may have great power
given him from God.

17 But a seer can know of things
which are past, and also of things
which are to come, and by them shall
all things be revealed, or, rather,
shall secret things be made manifest,
and hidden things shall come
to light, and things which are not
known shall be made known by
them, and also things shall be made
known by them which otherwise
could not be known.

18 Thus God has provided a means
that man, through faith, might
work mighty miracles; therefore
he becometh a great benefit to his
fellow beings.

19 And now, when Ammon had
made an end of speaking these words
the king rejoiced exceedingly, and
gave thanks to God, saying: Doubtless
a great mystery is contained
within these plates, and these interpreters
were doubtless prepared for
the purpose of unfolding all such
mysteries to the children of men.

20 O how marvelous are the works
of the Lord, and how long doth he
suffer with his people; yea, and
how blind and impenetrable are
the understandings of the children
of men; for they will not seek wisdom,
neither do they desire that
she should rule over them!

21 Yea, they are as a wild flock
which fleeth from the shepherd, and
scattereth, and are driven, and are
devoured by the beasts of the forest.



THE RECORD OF ZENIFF—An account
of his people, from the time they
left the land of Zarahemla until the
time that they were delivered out
of the hands of the Lamanites.
Comprising chapters 9 through 22.

CHAPTER 9

Zeniff leads a group from Zarahemla to
possess the land of Lehi-Nephi—The
Lamanite king permits them to inherit the
land—There is war between the Lamanites
and Zeniff's people. About 200-187 B.C.

I, Zeniff, having been taught in
all the language of the Nephites,
and having had a knowledge of the
land of Nephi, or of the land of our
fathers' first inheritance, and having
been sent as a spy among the
Lamanites that I might spy out their
forces, that our army might come
upon them and destroy them—but
when I saw that which was good
among them I was desirous that
they should not be destroyed.

2 Therefore, I contended with my
brethren in the wilderness, for I would
that our ruler should make a treaty
with them; but he being an austere
and a blood-thirsty man commanded
that I should be slain; but I was rescued
by the shedding of much blood;
for father fought against father, and
brother against brother, until the
greater number of our army was destroyed
in the wilderness; and we returned,
those of us that were spared,
to the land of Zarahemla, to relate that
tale to their wives and their children.

3 And yet, I being over-zealous
to inherit the land of our fathers,
collected as many as were desirous
to go up to possess the land, and
started again on our journey into
the wilderness to go up to the land;
but we were smitten with famine
and sore afflictions; for we were
slow to remember the Lord our God.

4 Nevertheless, after many days'
wandering in the wilderness we
pitched our tents in the place where
our brethren were slain, which was
near to the land of our fathers.

5 And it came to pass that I went
again with four of my men into the
