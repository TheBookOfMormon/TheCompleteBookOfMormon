seeds, and whatsoever thing we
had brought with us, every one according
to his age; wherefore, we
did all go down into the ship, with
our wives and our children.

7 And now, my father had begat
two sons in the wilderness; the elder
was called Jacob and the younger
Joseph.

8 And it came to pass after we had
all gone down into the ship, and had
taken with us our provisions and
things which had been commanded
us, we did put forth into the sea
and were driven forth before the
wind towards the promised land.

9 And after we had been driven
forth before the wind for the space
of many days, behold, my brethren
and the sons of Ishmael and also
their wives began to make themselves
merry, insomuch that they
began to dance, and to sing, and to
speak with much rudeness, yea, even
that they did forget by what power
they had been brought thither; yea,
they were lifted up unto exceeding
rudeness.

10 And I, Nephi, began to fear
exceedingly lest the Lord should
be angry with us, and smite us because
of our iniquity, that we should
be swallowed up in the depths of
the sea; wherefore, I, Nephi, began
to speak to them with much
soberness; but behold they were
angry with me, saying: We will not
that our younger brother shall be a
ruler over us.

11 And it came to pass that Laman
and Lemuel did take me and bind
me with cords, and they did treat
me with much harshness; nevertheless,
the Lord did suffer it that he
might show forth his power, unto the
fulfilling of his word which he had

12 And it came to pass that after
they had bound me insomuch that
I could not move, the compass,
which had been prepared of the
Lord, did cease to work.

13 Wherefore, they knew not
whither they should steer the ship,
insomuch that there arose a great
storm, yea, a great and terrible tempest,
and we were driven back upon
the waters for the space of three
days; and they began to be frightened
exceedingly lest they should
be drowned in the sea; nevertheless
they did not loose me.

14 And on the fourth day, which
we had been driven back, the tempest
began to be exceedingly sore.

15 And it came to pass that we
were about to be swallowed up in
the depths of the sea. And after
we had been driven back upon the
waters for the space of four days,
my brethren began to see that the
judgments of God were upon them,
and that they must perish save that
they should repent of their iniquities;
wherefore, they came unto
me, and loosed the bands which
were upon my wrists, and behold
they had swollen exceedingly; and
also mine ankles were much swollen,
and great was the soreness
thereof.

16 Nevertheless, I did look unto
my God, and I did praise him all
the day long; and I did not murmur
against the Lord because of mine
afflictions.

17 Now my father, Lehi, had said
many things unto them, and also
unto the sons of Ishmael; but, behold,
they did breathe out much
