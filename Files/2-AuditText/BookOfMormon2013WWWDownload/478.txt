spare them as a man spareth his
own son that serveth him.

18 Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the
wicked, between him that serveth
God and him that serveth him not.

CHAPTER 25

At the Second Coming, the proud and
wicked will be burned as stubble—
Elijah will return before that great and
dreadful day—Compare Malachi 4.
About A.D. 34.

For behold, the day cometh that
shall burn as an oven; and all the
proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day
that cometh shall burn them up,
saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall
leave them neither root nor branch.

2 But unto you that fear my name,
shall the Son of Righteousness
arise with healing in his wings; and
ye shall go forth and grow up as
calves in the stall.

3 And ye shall tread down the
wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day
that I shall do this, saith the Lord
of Hosts.

4 Remember ye the law of Moses,
my servant, which I commanded
unto him in Horeb for all Israel,
with the statutes and judgments.

5 Behold, I will send you Elijah
the prophet before the coming
of the great and dreadful day of
the Lord;

6 And he shall turn the heart of
the fathers to the children, and
the heart of the children to their
fathers, lest I come and smite the
earth with a curse.

CHAPTER 26

Jesus expounds all things from the beginning to the end—Babes and children
utter marvelous things that cannot be
written—Those in the Church of Christ
have all things in common among them.
About A.D. 34.

And now it came to pass that when
Jesus had told these things he expounded them unto the multitude;
and he did expound all things unto
them, both great and small.

2 And he saith: These scriptures,
which ye had not with you, the
Father commanded that I should
give unto you; for it was wisdom
in him that they should be given
unto future generations.

3 And he did expound all things,
even from the beginning until the
time that he should come in his
glory—yea, even all things which
should come upon the face of the
earth, even until the elements
should melt with fervent heat, and
the earth should be wrapt together
as a scroll, and the heavens and the
earth should pass away;

4 And even unto the great and last
day, when all people, and all kindreds, and all nations and tongues
shall stand before God, to be judged
