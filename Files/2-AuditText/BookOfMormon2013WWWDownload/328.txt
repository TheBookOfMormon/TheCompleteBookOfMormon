boasting in thy strength and thy
wisdom.

3 And this is not all, my son. Thou
didst do that which was grievous
unto me; for thou didst forsake the
ministry, and did go over into the
land of Siron among the borders
of the Lamanites, after the harlot
Isabel.

4 Yea, she did steal away the
hearts of many; but this was no excuse for thee, my son. Thou shouldst
have tended to the ministry wherewith thou wast entrusted.

5 Know ye not, my son, that these
things are an abomination in the
sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable
above all sins save it be the
shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?

6 For behold, if ye deny the Holy
Ghost when it once has had place
in you, and ye know that ye deny
it, behold, this is a sin which is
unpardonable; yea, and whosoever
murdereth against the light and
knowledge of God, it is not easy for
him to obtain forgiveness; yea, I
say unto you, my son, that it is not
easy for him to obtain a forgiveness.

7 And now, my son, I would to God
that ye had not been guilty of so
great a crime. I would not dwell
upon your crimes, to harrow up
your soul, if it were not for your
good.

8 But behold, ye cannot hide your
crimes from God; and except ye repent they will stand as a testimony
against you at the last day.

9 Now my son, I would that ye
should repent and forsake your sins,
and go no more after the lusts of
your eyes, but cross yourself in all
these things; for except ye do this ye
can in nowise inherit the kingdom
of God. Oh, remember, and take it
upon you, and cross yourself in
these things.

10 And I command you to take it
upon you to counsel with your elder
brothers in your undertakings; for
behold, thou art in thy youth, and
ye stand in need to be nourished
by your brothers. And give heed to
their counsel.

11 Suffer not yourself to be led
away by any vain or foolish thing;
suffer not the devil to lead away
your heart again after those wicked
harlots. Behold, O my son, how
great iniquity ye brought upon the
Zoramites; for when they saw your
conduct they would not believe in
my words.

12 And now the Spirit of the Lord
doth say unto me: Command thy
children to do good, lest they lead
away the hearts of many people to
destruction; therefore I command
you, my son, in the fear of God, that
ye refrain from your iniquities;

13 That ye turn to the Lord with
all your mind, might, and strength;
that ye lead away the hearts of no
more to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and acknowledge
your faults and that wrong which
ye have done.

14 Seek not after riches nor the
vain things of this world; for behold,
you cannot carry them with you.
