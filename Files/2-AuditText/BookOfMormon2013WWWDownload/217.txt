Nephi, as there were of the people
of Zarahemla, who was a descendant of Mulek, and those who came
with him into the wilderness.

3 And there were not so many of
the people of Nephi and of the people of Zarahemla as there were of
the Lamanites; yea, they were not
half so numerous.

4 And now all the people of Nephi
were assembled together, and also
all the people of Zarahemla, and
they were gathered together in
two bodies.

5 And it came to pass that Mosiah
did read, and caused to be read, the
records of Zeniff to his people; yea,
he read the records of the people
of Zeniff, from the time they left
the land of Zarahemla until they
returned again.

6 And he also read the account
of Alma and his brethren, and all
their afflictions, from the time they
left the land of Zarahemla until the
time they returned again.

7 And now, when Mosiah had made
an end of reading the records, his
people who tarried in the land were
struck with wonder and amazement.

8 For they knew not what to think;
for when they beheld those that
had been delivered out of bondage
they were filled with exceedingly
great joy.

9 And again, when they thought of
their brethren who had been slain
by the Lamanites they were filled
with sorrow, and even shed many
tears of sorrow.

10 And again, when they thought
of the immediate goodness of
God, and his power in delivering
Alma and his brethren out of the
hands of the Lamanites and of
bondage, they did raise their voices
and give thanks to God.

11 And again, when they thought
upon the Lamanites, who were their
brethren, of their sinful and polluted state, they were filled with
pain and anguish for the welfare
of their souls.

12 And it came to pass that those
who were the children of Amulon
and his brethren, who had taken to
wife the daughters of the Lamanites, were displeased with the
conduct of their fathers, and they
would no longer be called by the
names of their fathers, therefore
they took upon themselves the
name of Nephi, that they might be
called the children of Nephi and
be numbered among those who
were called Nephites.

13 And now all the people of
Zarahemla were numbered with
the Nephites, and this because the
kingdom had been conferred upon
none but those who were descendants of Nephi.

14 And now it came to pass that
when Mosiah had made an end of
speaking and reading to the people, he desired that Alma should
also speak to the people.

15 And Alma did speak unto them,
when they were assembled together
in large bodies, and he went from
one body to another, preaching unto
the people repentance and faith on
the Lord.

16 And he did exhort the people of
Limhi and his brethren, all those that
had been delivered out of bondage,
that they should remember that it
was the Lord that did deliver them.

17 And it came to pass that after
Alma had taught the people many
things, and had made an end of
speaking to them, that king Limhi
was desirous that he might be
baptized; and all his people were
