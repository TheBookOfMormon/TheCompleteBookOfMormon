24 And if they will not repent
and believe in his name, and be
baptized in his name, and endure
to the end, they must be damned;
for the Lord God, the Holy One of
Israel, has spoken it.

25 Wherefore, he has given a
law; and where there is no law
given there is no punishment; and
where there is no punishment there
is no condemnation; and where
there is no condemnation the mercies
of the Holy One of Israel have
claim upon them, because of the
atonement; for they are delivered
by the power of him.

26 For the atonement satisfieth
the demands of his justice upon all
those who have not the law given

rich as to the things of the world.
For because they are rich they despise
the poor, and they persecute
the meek, and their hearts are upon
their treasures; wherefore, their
treasure is their god. And behold,
their treasure shall perish with
them also.

31 And wo unto the deaf that will
not hear; for they shall perish.

32 Wo unto the blind that will
not see; for they shall perish also.

33 Wo unto the uncircumcised
of heart, for a knowledge of their
