life. And then may God grant unto
you that your burdens may be
light, through the joy of his Son. And
even all this can ye do if ye will.
Amen.

CHAPTER 34

Amulek testifies that the word is in
Christ unto salvation—Unless an
atonement is made, all mankind must
perish—The whole law of Moses points
toward the sacrifice of the Son of God—
The eternal plan of redemption is based
on faith and repentance—Pray for temporal
and spiritual blessings—This life
is the time for men to prepare to meet
God—Work out your salvation with
fear before God. About 74 B.C.

And now it came to pass that after
Alma had spoken these words unto
them he sat down upon the ground,
and Amulek arose and began to
teach them, saying:

2 My brethren, I think that it is
impossible that ye should be ignorant of the things which have been
spoken concerning the coming of
Christ, who is taught by us to be
the Son of God; yea, I know that
these things were taught unto you
bountifully before your dissension
from among us.

3 And as ye have desired of my beloved brother that he should make
known unto you what ye should
do, because of your afflictions; and
he hath spoken somewhat unto you
to prepare your minds; yea, and he
hath exhorted you unto faith and
to patience—

4 Yea, even that ye would have so
much faith as even to plant the
word in your hearts, that ye may
try the experiment of its goodness.

5 And we have beheld that the
great question which is in your
minds is whether the word be in the
Son of God, or whether there shall
be no Christ.

6 And ye also beheld that my
brother has proved unto you, in
many instances, that the word is
in Christ unto salvation.

7 My brother has called upon the
words of Zenos, that redemption
cometh through the Son of God, and
also upon the words of Zenock; and
also he has appealed unto Moses,
to prove that these things are true.

8 And now, behold, I will testify
unto you of myself that these things
are true. Behold, I say unto you, that
I do know that Christ shall come
among the children of men, to take
upon him the transgressions of his
people, and that he shall atone for
the sins of the world; for the Lord
God hath spoken it.

9 For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according
to the great plan of the Eternal God
there must be an atonement made,
or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened;
yea, all are fallen and are lost, and
must perish except it be through
the atonement which it is expedient
should be made.

10 For it is expedient that there
should be a great and last sacrifice;
yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither
of beast, neither of any manner of
fowl; for it shall not be a human
sacrifice; but it must be an infinite
and eternal sacrifice.
