wronged while in the land of their
first inheritance, after they had
crossed the sea, and all this because
that Nephi was more faithful in
keeping the commandments of the
Lord—therefore he was favored
of the Lord, for the Lord heard his
prayers and answered them, and
he took the lead of their journey
in the wilderness.

14 And his brethren were wroth
with him because they understood
not the dealings of the Lord; they
were also wroth with him upon the
waters because they hardened their
hearts against the Lord.

15 And again, they were wroth
with him when they had arrived
in the promised land, because they
said that he had taken the ruling
of the people out of their hands;
and they sought to kill him.

16 And again, they were wroth
with him because he departed
into the wilderness as the Lord
had commanded him, and took the
records which were engraven on
the plates of brass, for they said
that he robbed them.

17 And thus they have taught
their children that they should hate
them, and that they should murder
them, and that they should rob
and plunder them, and do all they
could to destroy them; therefore
they have an eternal hatred towards
the children of Nephi.

18 For this very cause has king
Laman, by his cunning, and lying
craftiness, and his fair promises,
deceived me, that I have brought
this my people up into this land,
that they may destroy them; yea,
and we have suffered these many
years in the land.

19 And now I, Zeniff, after having
told all these things unto my people
concerning the Lamanites, I did
stimulate them to go to battle with
their might, putting their trust in
the Lord; therefore, we did contend
with them, face to face.

20 And it came to pass that we did
drive them again out of our land;
and we slew them with a great
slaughter, even so many that we
did not number them.

21 And it came to pass that we
returned again to our own land,
and my people again began to
tend their flocks, and to till their
ground.

22 And now I, being old, did confer
the kingdom upon one of my sons;
therefore, I say no more. And may
the Lord bless my people. Amen.

CHAPTER 11

King Noah rules in wickedness—He
revels in riotous living with his wives
and concubines—Abinadi prophesies
that the people will be taken into bondage—
His life is sought by King Noah.
About 160-150 B.C.

And now it came to pass that
Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon
Noah, one of his sons; therefore
Noah began to reign in his stead;
and he did not walk in the ways of
his father.

2 For behold, he did not keep the
commandments of God, but he did
walk after the desires of his own
heart. And he had many wives and
concubines. And he did cause his
people to commit sin, and do that
which was abominable in the sight
of the Lord. Yea, and they did commit
whoredoms and all manner of
wickedness.

3 And he laid a tax of one fifth
part of all they possessed, a fifth part
of their gold and of their silver,
