baptize in Bethabara, beyond
Jordan; and he also said he should
baptize with water; even that he
should baptize the Messiah with
water.

10 And after he had baptized the
Messiah with water, he should behold
and bear record that he had
baptized the Lamb of God, who
should take away the sins of the
world.

11 And it came to pass after my
father had spoken these words he
spake unto my brethren concerning
the gospel which should be
preached among the Jews, and also
concerning the dwindling of the
Jews in unbelief. And after they
had slain the Messiah, who should
come, and after he had been slain
he should rise from the dead, and
should make himself manifest, by
the Holy Ghost, unto the Gentiles.

12 Yea, even my father spake much
concerning the Gentiles, and also
concerning the house of Israel, that
they should be compared like unto
an olive tree, whose branches
should be broken off and should
be scattered upon all the face of
the earth.

13 Wherefore, he said it must needs
be that we should be led with one
accord into the land of promise,
unto the fulfilling of the word of
the Lord, that we should be scattered
upon all the face of the earth.

14 And after the house of Israel
should be scattered they should be
gathered together again; or, in fine,
after the Gentiles had received the
fulness of the Gospel, the natural
branches of the olive tree, or the
remnants of the house of Israel,
should be grafted in, or come to the
knowledge of the true Messiah, their
Lord and their Redeemer.

15 And after this manner of language
did my father prophesy
and speak unto my brethren, and
also many more things which I do
not write in this book; for I have
written as many of them as were
expedient for me in mine other
book.

16 And all these things, of which
I have spoken, were done as my
father dwelt in a tent, in the valley
of Lemuel.

17 And it came to pass after I,
Nephi, having heard all the words
of my father, concerning the things
which he saw in a vision, and also
the things which he spake by the
power of the Holy Ghost, which
power he received by faith on the
Son of God—and the Son of God was
the Messiah who should come—I,
Nephi, was desirous also that I
might see, and hear, and know of
these things, by the power of the
Holy Ghost, which is the gift of
God unto all those who diligently
seek him, as well in times of old
