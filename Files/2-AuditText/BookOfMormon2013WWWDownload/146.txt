4 For, for this intent have we written
these things, that they may
know that we knew of Christ, and
we had a hope of his glory many
hundred years before his coming;
and not only we ourselves had a
hope of his glory, but also all the
holy prophets which were before us.

5 Behold, they believed in Christ
and worshiped the Father in his
name, and also we worship the
Father in his name. And for this
intent we keep the law of Moses,
it pointing our souls to him; and
for this cause it is sanctified unto
us for righteousness, even as it was
accounted unto Abraham in the
wilderness to be obedient unto the
commands of God in offering up his
son Isaac, which is a similitude of
God and his Only Begotten Son.

6 Wherefore, we search the prophets,
and we have many revelations
and the spirit of prophecy; and
having all these witnesses we obtain
a hope, and our faith becometh
unshaken, insomuch that we truly
can command in the name of
Jesus and the very trees obey us,
or the mountains, or the waves of
the sea.

7 Nevertheless, the Lord God
showeth us our weakness that we
may know that it is by his grace,
and his great condescensions unto
the children of men, that we have
power to do these things.

8 Behold, great and marvelous are
the works of the Lord. How unsearchable
are the depths of the
mysteries of him; and it is impossible
that man should find out all
his ways. And no man knoweth
of his ways save it be revealed unto
him; wherefore, brethren, despise
not the revelations of God.

9 For behold, by the power of his
word man came upon the face of
the earth, which earth was created
by the power of his word. Wherefore,
if God being able to speak and
the world was, and to speak and man
was created, O then, why not able
to command the earth, or the
workmanship of his hands upon
the face of it, according to his will
and pleasure?

10 Wherefore, brethren, seek not to
counsel the Lord, but to take counsel
from his hand. For behold, ye
yourselves know that he counseleth
in wisdom, and in justice, and in
great mercy, over all his works.

11 Wherefore, beloved brethren,
be reconciled unto him through
the atonement of Christ, his Only
