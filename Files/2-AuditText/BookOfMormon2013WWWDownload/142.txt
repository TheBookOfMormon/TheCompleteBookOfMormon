before God, which thing is pleasing unto God;

8 And it supposeth me that they
have come up hither to hear the
pleasing word of God, yea, the word
which healeth the wounded soul.

9 Wherefore, it burdeneth my soul
that I should be constrained, because
of the strict commandment
which I have received from God, to
admonish you according to your
crimes, to enlarge the wounds of
those who are already wounded, instead
of consoling and healing their
wounds; and those who have not
been wounded, instead of feasting
upon the pleasing word of God have
daggers placed to pierce their souls
and wound their delicate minds.

10 But, notwithstanding the greatness
of the task, I must do according
to the strict commands of God, and
tell you concerning your wickedness
and abominations, in the presence
of the pure in heart, and the broken
heart, and under the glance of the
piercing eye of the Almighty God.

11 Wherefore, I must tell you the
truth according to the plainness
of the word of God. For behold, as
I inquired of the Lord, thus came
the word unto me, saying: Jacob,
get thou up into the temple on the
morrow, and declare the word which
I shall give thee unto this people.

12 And now behold, my brethren,
this is the word which I declare unto
you, that many of you have begun
to search for gold, and for silver, and
for all manner of precious ores, in
the which this land, which is a land
of promise unto you and to your
seed, doth abound most plentifully.

13 And the hand of providence
hath smiled upon you most pleasingly,
that you have obtained many
riches; and because some of you have
obtained more abundantly than that
of your brethren ye are lifted up in
the pride of your hearts, and wear
stiff necks and high heads because
of the costliness of your apparel,
and persecute your brethren because
ye suppose that ye are better
than they.

14 And now, my brethren, do ye
suppose that God justifieth you in
this thing? Behold, I say unto you,
Nay. But he condemneth you, and if
ye persist in these things his judgments
must speedily come unto you.

15 O that he would show you that
he can pierce you, and with one
glance of his eye he can smite you
to the dust!

16 O that he would rid you from
this iniquity and abomination. And,
O that ye would listen unto the
word of his commands, and let not
this pride of your hearts destroy
your souls!

17 Think of your brethren like
unto yourselves, and be familiar
with all and free with your substance,
that they may be rich like
unto you.

18 But before ye seek for riches,
seek ye for the kingdom of God.

19 And after ye have obtained a
hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches,
if ye seek them; and ye will seek
them for the intent to do goodâ€”
