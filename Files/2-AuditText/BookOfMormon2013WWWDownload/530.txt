his son, did obtain the kingdom; and
he did reign over the people all his
days. And he did do all manner of
iniquity in his days, by which he
did cause the shedding of much
blood; and few were his days.

11 And Ethem, being a descendant
of Ahah, did obtain the kingdom;
and he also did do that which was
wicked in his days.

12 And it came to pass that in the
days of Ethem there came many
prophets, and prophesied again
unto the people; yea, they did prophesy that the Lord would utterly
destroy them from off the face of
the earth except they repented of
their iniquities.

13 And it came to pass that the
people hardened their hearts, and
would not hearken unto their words;
and the prophets mourned and
withdrew from among the people.

14 And it came to pass that Ethem
did execute judgment in wickedness all his days; and he begat Moron. And it came to pass that Moron
did reign in his stead; and Moron did
that which was wicked before the
Lord.

15 And it came to pass that there
arose a rebellion among the people,
because of that secret combination
which was built up to get power and
gain; and there arose a mighty man
among them in iniquity, and gave
battle unto Moron, in which he did
overthrow the half of the kingdom;
and he did maintain the half of the
kingdom for many years.

16 And it came to pass that Moron
did overthrow him, and did obtain
the kingdom again.

17 And it came to pass that there
arose another mighty man; and he
was a descendant of the brother
of Jared.

18 And it came to pass that he did
overthrow Moron and obtain the
kingdom; wherefore, Moron dwelt
in captivity all the remainder of
his days; and he begat Coriantor.

19 And it came to pass that
Coriantor dwelt in captivity all
his days.

20 And in the days of Coriantor
there also came many prophets,
and prophesied of great and marvelous things, and cried repentance
unto the people, and except they
should repent the Lord God would
execute judgment against them to
their utter destruction;

21 And that the Lord God would
send or bring forth another people to possess the land, by his
power, after the manner by which
he brought their fathers.

22 And they did reject all the
words of the prophets, because of
their secret society and wicked
abominations.

23 And it came to pass that Coriantor begat Ether, and he died, having dwelt in captivity all his days.

CHAPTER 12

The prophet Ether exhorts the people
to believe in God—Moroni recounts the
wonders and marvels done by faith—
Faith enabled the brother of Jared to
see Christ—The Lord gives men weakness
that they may be humble—The
brother of Jared moved Mount Zerin
by faith—Faith, hope, and charity are
essential to salvation—Moroni saw
Jesus face to face.

And it came to pass that the days
of Ether were in the days of Coriantumr; and Coriantumr was king
over all the land.

Lord; wherefore Ether came forth
