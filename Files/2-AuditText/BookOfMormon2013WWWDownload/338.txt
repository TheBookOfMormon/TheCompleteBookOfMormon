Lamanites were marching round
about in the wilderness, that they
might come over into the land of
Manti, that they might commence
an attack upon the weaker part of
the people. And those messengers
went and delivered the message
unto Moroni.

25 Now Moroni, leaving a part of
his army in the land of Jershon,
lest by any means a part of the
Lamanites should come into that
land and take possession of the city,
took the remaining part of his army
and marched over into the land
of Manti.

26 And he caused that all the
people in that quarter of the land
should gather themselves together
to battle against the Lamanites, to
defend their lands and their country, their rights and their liberties; therefore they were prepared
against the time of the coming of
the Lamanites.

27 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his army should
be secreted in the valley which was
near the bank of the river Sidon,
which was on the west of the river
Sidon in the wilderness.

28 And Moroni placed spies round
about, that he might know when
the camp of the Lamanites should
come.

29 And now, as Moroni knew the
intention of the Lamanites, that it
was their intention to destroy their
brethren, or to subject them and
bring them into bondage that they
might establish a kingdom unto
themselves over all the land;

30 And he also knowing that it
was the only desire of the Nephites
to preserve their lands, and their
liberty, and their church, therefore
he thought it no sin that he should
defend them by stratagem; therefore, he found by his spies which
course the Lamanites were to take.

31 Therefore, he divided his army
and brought a part over into the
valley, and concealed them on the
east, and on the south of the hill
Riplah;

32 And the remainder he concealed
in the west valley, on the west of
the river Sidon, and so down into
the borders of the land Manti.

33 And thus having placed his
army according to his desire, he
was prepared to meet them.

34 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites came up on the north of
the hill, where a part of the army
of Moroni was concealed.

35 And as the Lamanites had
passed the hill Riplah, and came
into the valley, and began to cross
the river Sidon, the army which
was concealed on the south of the
hill, which was led by a man whose
name was Lehi, and he led his army
forth and encircled the Lamanites
about on the east in their rear.

36 And it came to pass that the Lamanites, when they saw the Nephites coming upon them in their
rear, turned them about and began
to contend with the army of Lehi.

37 And the work of death commenced on both sides, but it was
more dreadful on the part of the
Lamanites, for their nakedness
was exposed to the heavy blows
of the Nephites with their swords
and their cimeters, which brought
death almost at every stroke.

38 While on the other hand, there
was now and then a man fell among
the Nephites, by their swords and
the loss of blood, they being shielded
from the more vital parts of the
body, or the more vital parts of
the body being shielded from the
strokes of the Lamanites, by their
breastplates, and their armshields,
and their head-plates; and thus the
Nephites did carry on the work of
death among the Lamanites.
