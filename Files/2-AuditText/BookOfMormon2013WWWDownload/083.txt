of the fruit of thy loins; and unto
him will I give power to bring
forth my word unto the seed of thy
loinsâ€”and not to the bringing forth
my word only, saith the Lord, but
to the convincing them of my word,
which shall have already gone forth
among them.

12 Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins
shall write; and the fruit of the
loins of Judah shall write; and that
which shall be written by the fruit of
thy loins, and also that which shall
be written by the fruit of the loins
of Judah, shall grow together, unto
the confounding of false doctrines
and laying down of contentions, and
establishing peace among the fruit
of thy loins, and bringing them
to the knowledge of their fathers
in the latter days, and also to the
knowledge of my covenants, saith
the Lord.

13 And out of weakness he shall
be made strong, in that day when
my work shall commence among all
my people, unto the restoring thee,
O house of Israel, saith the Lord.

14 And thus prophesied Joseph,
saying: Behold, that seer will the
Lord bless; and they that seek to
destroy him shall be confounded;
for this promise, which I have obtained
of the Lord, of the fruit of
my loins, shall be fulfilled. Behold,
I am sure of the fulfilling of this
promise;

15 And his name shall be called after
me; and it shall be after the name
of his father. And he shall be like
unto me; for the thing, which the
Lord shall bring forth by his hand,
by the power of the Lord shall bring
my people unto salvation.

16 Yea, thus prophesied Joseph: I
am sure of this thing, even as I am
sure of the promise of Moses; for
the Lord hath said unto me, I will
preserve thy seed forever.

17 And the Lord hath said: I will
raise up a Moses; and I will give
power unto him in a rod; and I will
give judgment unto him in writing.
Yet I will not loose his tongue, that
he shall speak much, for I will not
make him mighty in speaking. But
I will write unto him my law, by
the finger of mine own hand; and
I will make a spokesman for him.

18 And the Lord said unto me
also: I will raise up unto the fruit of
thy loins; and I will make for him
a spokesman. And I, behold, I will
give unto him that he shall write
the writing of the fruit of thy loins,
unto the fruit of thy loins; and the
spokesman of thy loins shall declare
it.

19 And the words which he shall
write shall be the words which are
expedient in my wisdom should go
forth unto the fruit of thy loins.
And it shall be as if the fruit of thy
loins had cried unto them from the
dust; for I know their faith.

20 And they shall cry from the
dust; yea, even repentance unto
their brethren, even after many
generations have gone by them.
And it shall come to pass that their
cry shall go, even according to the
simpleness of their words.

21 Because of their faith their
words shall proceed forth out of
