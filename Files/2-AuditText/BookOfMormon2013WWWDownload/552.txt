just and true; wherefore, nothing
that is good denieth the Christ, but
acknowledgeth that he is.

7 And ye may know that he is, by
the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I would exhort you that ye deny
not the power of God; for he worketh
by power, according to the faith
of the children of men, the same
today and tomorrow, and forever.

8 And again, I exhort you, my
brethren, that ye deny not the
gifts of God, for they are many;
and they come from the same God.
And there are different ways that
these gifts are administered; but it
is the same God who worketh all in
all; and they are given by the manifestations of the Spirit of God unto
men, to profit them.

9 For behold, to one is given by
the Spirit of God, that he may teach
the word of wisdom;

10 And to another, that he may
teach the word of knowledge by
the same Spirit;

11 And to another, exceedingly
great faith; and to another, the
gifts of healing by the same Spirit;

12 And again, to another, that he
may work mighty miracles;

13 And again, to another, that he
may prophesy concerning all things;

14 And again, to another, the beholding of angels and ministering
spirits;

15 And again, to another, all kinds
of tongues;

16 And again, to another, the interpretation of languages and of
divers kinds of tongues.

17 And all these gifts come by the
Spirit of Christ; and they come unto
every man severally, according as
he will.

18 And I would exhort you, my
beloved brethren, that ye remember that every good gift cometh
of Christ.

19 And I would exhort you, my
beloved brethren, that ye remember that he is the same yesterday,
today, and forever, and that all
these gifts of which I have spoken,
which are spiritual, never will be
done away, even as long as the world
shall stand, only according to the
unbelief of the children of men.

20 Wherefore, there must be faith;
and if there must be faith there must
also be hope; and if there must be
hope there must also be charity.

21 And except ye have charity
ye can in nowise be saved in the
kingdom of God; neither can ye be
saved in the kingdom of God if ye
have not faith; neither can ye if
ye have no hope.

22 And if ye have no hope ye must
needs be in despair; and despair
cometh because of iniquity.

23 And Christ truly said unto our
fathers: If ye have faith ye can do
all things which are expedient unto
me.

24 And now I speak unto all the
ends of the earthâ€”that if the day
cometh that the power and gifts of
God shall be done away among you,
it shall be because of unbelief.

25 And wo be unto the children
of men if this be the case; for there
shall be none that doeth good
among you, no not one. For if there
