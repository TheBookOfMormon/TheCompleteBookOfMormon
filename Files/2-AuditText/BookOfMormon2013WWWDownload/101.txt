liberty unto the Gentiles, and there
shall be no kings upon the land,
who shall raise up unto the Gentiles.

12 And I will fortify this land
against all other nations.

13 And he that fighteth against
Zion shall perish, saith God.

14 For he that raiseth up a king
against me shall perish, for I, the
Lord, the king of heaven, will be
their king, and I will be a light unto
them forever, that hear my words.

15 Wherefore, for this cause, that
my covenants may be fulfilled
which I have made unto the children
of men, that I will do unto them
while they are in the flesh, I must
needs destroy the secret works of
darkness, and of murders, and of
abominations.

16 Wherefore, he that fighteth
against Zion, both Jew and Gentile,
both bond and free, both male
and female, shall perish; for they

that dwell thereon that they shall
worship me, saith God.

20 And now, my beloved brethren,
seeing that our merciful God has
given us so great knowledge concerning
these things, let us remember
him, and lay aside our sins, and
not hang down our heads, for we are
not cast off; nevertheless, we have
been driven out of the land of our
inheritance; but we have been led
to a better land, for the Lord has
made the sea our path, and we are
upon an isle of the sea.

21 But great are the promises of
the Lord unto them who are upon
the isles of the sea; wherefore as it
says isles, there must needs be more
