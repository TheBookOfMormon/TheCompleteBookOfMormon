upon all the face of the land, every
man with his band fighting for that
which he desired.

26 And there were robbers, and
in fine, all manner of wickedness
upon all the face of the land.

27 And it came to pass that Coriantumr
was exceedingly angry with
Shared, and he went against him
with his armies to battle; and they
did meet in great anger, and they
did meet in the valley of Gilgal; and
the battle became exceedingly sore.

28 And it came to pass that Shared
fought against him for the space
of three days. And it came to pass
that Coriantumr beat him, and did
pursue him until he came to the
plains of Heshlon.

29 And it came to pass that Shared
gave him battle again upon the
plains; and behold, he did beat
Coriantumr, and drove him back
again to the valley of Gilgal.

30 And Coriantumr gave Shared
battle again in the valley of Gilgal, in
which he beat Shared and slew him.

31 And Shared wounded Coriantumr in his thigh, that he did not
go to battle again for the space of
two years, in which time all the
people upon the face of the land
were shedding blood, and there
was none to restrain them.

CHAPTER 14

The iniquity of the people brings a curse
upon the land—Coriantumr engages in
warfare against Gilead, then Lib, and
then Shiz—Blood and carnage cover
the land.

And now there began to be a great
curse upon all the land because of
the iniquity of the people, in which,
if a man should lay his tool or his
sword upon his shelf, or upon the
place whither he would keep it,
behold, upon the morrow, he could
not find it, so great was the curse
upon the land.

2 Wherefore every man did cleave
unto that which was his own, with
his hands, and would not borrow
neither would he lend; and every
man kept the hilt of his sword in
his right hand, in the defence of
his property and his own life and
of his wives and children.

3 And now, after the space of two
years, and after the death of Shared,
behold, there arose the brother of
Shared and he gave battle unto
Coriantumr, in which Coriantumr
did beat him and did pursue him
to the wilderness of Akish.

4 And it came to pass that the
brother of Shared did give battle
unto him in the wilderness of Akish;
and the battle became exceedingly
sore, and many thousands fell by
the sword.

5 And it came to pass that Coriantumr did lay siege to the wilderness; and the brother of Shared did
march forth out of the wilderness by
night, and slew a part of the army of
Coriantumr, as they were drunken.

6 And he came forth to the land
of Moron, and placed himself upon
the throne of Coriantumr.

7 And it came to pass that Coriantumr dwelt with his army in the
wilderness for the space of two
years, in which he did receive great
strength to his army.

8 Now the brother of Shared, whose
name was Gilead, also received great
strength to his army, because of secret combinations.

9 And it came to pass that his high
priest murdered him as he sat upon
his throne.

10 And it came to pass that one of
the secret combinations murdered
him in a secret pass, and obtained
unto himself the kingdom; and his
name was Lib; and Lib was a man of
great stature, more than any other
man among all the people.

11 And it came to pass that in the
first year of Lib, Coriantumr came
up unto the land of Moron, and
gave battle unto Lib.
