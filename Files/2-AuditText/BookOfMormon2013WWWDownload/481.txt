is built upon my gospel then will
the Father show forth his own works
in it.

11 But if it be not built upon my
gospel, and is built upon the works
of men, or upon the works of the
devil, verily I say unto you they have
joy in their works for a season,
and by and by the end cometh, and
they are hewn down and cast into
the fire, from whence there is no
return.

12 For their works do follow them,
for it is because of their works that
they are hewn down; therefore remember the things that I have told
you.

13 Behold I have given unto you
my gospel, and this is the gospel
which I have given unto you—that I
came into the world to do the will
of my Father, because my Father
sent me.

14 And my Father sent me that I
might be lifted up upon the cross;
and after that I had been lifted up
upon the cross, that I might draw
all men unto me, that as I have been
lifted up by men even so should
men be lifted up by the Father, to
stand before me, to be judged of
their works, whether they be good
or whether they be evil—

15 And for this cause have I been
lifted up; therefore, according to
the power of the Father I will draw
all men unto me, that they may be
judged according to their works.

16 And it shall come to pass, that
whoso repenteth and is baptized
in my name shall be filled; and if
he endureth to the end, behold,
him will I hold guiltless before
my Father at that day when I shall
stand to judge the world.

17 And he that endureth not unto
the end, the same is he that is also
hewn down and cast into the fire,
from whence they can no more
return, because of the justice of
the Father.

18 And this is the word which he
hath given unto the children of men.
And for this cause he fulfilleth the
words which he hath given, and he
lieth not, but fulfilleth all his words.

19 And no unclean thing can
enter into his kingdom; therefore
nothing entereth into his rest save
it be those who have washed their
garments in my blood, because of
their faith, and the repentance of
all their sins, and their faithfulness
unto the end.

20 Now this is the commandment:
Repent, all ye ends of the earth,
and come unto me and be baptized
in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy
Ghost, that ye may stand spotless
before me at the last day.

21 Verily, verily, I say unto you,
this is my gospel; and ye know
the things that ye must do in my
church; for the works which ye
have seen me do that shall ye also
do; for that which ye have seen me
do even that shall ye do;
