18 Now was not this exceeding joy? Behold, this is joy which
none receiveth save it be the truly
penitent and humble seeker of
happiness.

19 Now the joy of Alma in meeting
his brethren was truly great, and
also the joy of Aaron, of Omner, and
Himni; but behold their joy was not
that to exceed their strength.

20 And now it came to pass that
Alma conducted his brethren back
to the land of Zarahemla; even to
his own house. And they went and
told the chief judge all the things
that had happened unto them in
the land of Nephi, among their
brethren, the Lamanites.

21 And it came to pass that the
chief judge sent a proclamation
throughout all the land, desiring
the voice of the people concerning the admitting their brethren,
who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

22 And it came to pass that the
voice of the people came, saying:
Behold, we will give up the land of
Jershon, which is on the east by the
sea, which joins the land Bountiful,
which is on the south of the land
Bountiful; and this land Jershon is
the land which we will give unto
our brethren for an inheritance.

23 And behold, we will set our
armies between the land Jershon
and the land Nephi, that we may
protect our brethren in the land
Jershon; and this we do for our
brethren, on account of their
fear to take up arms against their
brethren lest they should commit
sin; and this their great fear came
because of their sore repentance
which they had, on account of their
many murders and their awful
wickedness.

24 And now behold, this will we
do unto our brethren, that they
may inherit the land Jershon; and
we will guard them from their enemies
with our armies, on condition
that they will give us a portion of
their substance to assist us that we
may maintain our armies.

25 Now, it came to pass that when
Ammon had heard this, he returned
to the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi,
and also Alma with him, into the
wilderness, where they had pitched
their tents, and made known unto
them all these things. And Alma
also related unto them his conversion, with Ammon and Aaron, and
his brethren.

26 And it came to pass that it did
cause great joy among them. And
they went down into the land of
Jershon, and took possession of
the land of Jershon; and they were
called by the Nephites the people
of Ammon; therefore they were
distinguished by that name ever
after.

27 And they were among the people of Nephi, and also numbered
among the people who were of the
church of God. And they were also
distinguished for their zeal towards
God, and also towards men; for they
were perfectly honest and upright
in all things; and they were firm
in the faith of Christ, even unto
the end.

28 And they did look upon shedding the blood of their brethren
with the greatest abhorrence; and
they never could be prevailed upon
to take up arms against their brethren; and they never did look upon
death with any degree of terror, for
their hope and views of Christ and
the resurrection; therefore, death
was swallowed up to them by the
victory of Christ over it.

29 Therefore, they would suffer
