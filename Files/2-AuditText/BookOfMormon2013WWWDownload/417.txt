28 And it came to pass that it was
expedient that there should be a
stop put to this work of destruction; therefore they sent an army
of strong men into the wilderness
and upon the mountains to search
out this band of robbers, and to
destroy them.

29 But behold, it came to pass that
in that same year they were driven
back even into their own lands.
And thus ended the eightieth year
of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

30 And it came to pass in the
commencement of the eighty and
first year they did go forth again
against this band of robbers, and
did destroy many; and they were
also visited with much destruction.

31 And they were again obliged to
return out of the wilderness and out
of the mountains unto their own
lands, because of the exceeding
greatness of the numbers of those
robbers who infested the mountains
and the wilderness.

32 And it came to pass that thus
ended this year. And the robbers
did still increase and wax strong,
insomuch that they did defy the
whole armies of the Nephites, and
also of the Lamanites; and they did
cause great fear to come unto the
people upon all the face of the land.

33 Yea, for they did visit many
parts of the land, and did do great
destruction unto them; yea, did kill
many, and did carry away others
captive into the wilderness, yea,
and more especially their women
and their children.

34 Now this great evil, which came
unto the people because of their
iniquity, did stir them up again in
remembrance of the Lord their God.

35 And thus ended the eighty and
first year of the reign of the judges.

36 And in the eighty and second
year they began again to forget the
Lord their God. And in the eighty
and third year they began to wax
strong in iniquity. And in the eighty
and fourth year they did not mend
their ways.

37 And it came to pass in the eighty
and fifth year they did wax stronger and stronger in their pride, and
in their wickedness; and thus they
were ripening again for destruction.

38 And thus ended the eighty and
fifth year.

CHAPTER 12

Men are unstable and foolish and
quick to do evil—The Lord chastens
His people—The nothingness of men is
compared with the power of God—In
the day of judgment, men will gain everlasting life or everlasting damnation.
About 6 B.C.

And thus we can behold how false,
and also the unsteadiness of the
hearts of the children of men; yea,
we can see that the Lord in his
great infinite goodness doth bless
and prosper those who put their
trust in him.

2 Yea, and we may see at the very
time when he doth prosper his
people, yea, in the increase of their
fields, their flocks and their herds,
and in gold, and in silver, and in all
manner of precious things of every
kind and art; sparing their lives,
and delivering them out of the
hands of their enemies; softening
the hearts of their enemies that they
should not declare wars against
them; yea, and in fine, doing all
things for the welfare and happiness
of his people; yea, then is the time
that they do harden their hearts,
and do forget the Lord their God,
and do trample under their feet the
