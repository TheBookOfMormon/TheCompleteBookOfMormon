mischief and subtlety, and did seek
in the wilderness for beasts of prey.

25 And the Lord God said unto
me: They shall be a scourge unto
thy seed, to stir them up in remembrance
of me; and inasmuch as they
will not remember me, and hearken
unto my words, they shall scourge
them even unto destruction.

26 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,
did consecrate Jacob and Joseph,
that they should be priests and
teachers over the land of my people.

27 And it came to pass that we lived
after the manner of happiness.

28 And thirty years had passed
away from the time we left Jerusalem.

29 And I, Nephi, had kept the
records upon my plates, which I
had made, of my people thus far.

30 And it came to pass that the
Lord God said unto me: Make other
plates; and thou shalt engraven
many things upon them which are
good in my sight, for the profit of
thy people.

31 Wherefore, I, Nephi, to be obedient
to the commandments of the
Lord, went and made these plates
upon which I have engraven these
things.

32 And I engraved that which
is pleasing unto God. And if my
people are pleased with the things
of God they will be pleased with
mine engravings which are upon
these plates.

33 And if my people desire to
know the more particular part of
the history of my people they must
search mine other plates.

34 And it sufficeth me to say that
forty years had passed away, and
we had already had wars and contentions
with our brethren.

CHAPTER 6

Jacob recounts Jewish history: The
Babylonian captivity and return; the
ministry and crucifixion of the Holy
One of Israel; the help received from
the Gentiles; and the Jews' latter-day
restoration when they believe in the
Messiah. About 559-545 B.C.

The words of Jacob, the brother
of Nephi, which he spake unto the
people of Nephi:

2 Behold, my beloved brethren, I,
Jacob, having been called of God,
and ordained after the manner of
his holy order, and having been
consecrated by my brother Nephi,
unto whom ye look as a king or a
protector, and on whom ye depend
for safety, behold ye know that I
have spoken unto you exceedingly
many things.

3 Nevertheless, I speak unto you
again; for I am desirous for the welfare
of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety
is great for you; and ye yourselves
know that it ever has been. For I
have exhorted you with all diligence;
and I have taught you the words of
my father; and I have spoken unto
you concerning all things which
are written, from the creation of
the world.

4 And now, behold, I would speak
unto you concerning things which
are, and which are to come; wherefore,
I will read you the words of
Isaiah. And they are the words
which my brother has desired that I
should speak unto you. And I speak
unto you for your sakes, that ye
may learn and glorify the name of
your God.

5 And now, the words which I shall
read are they which Isaiah spake
concerning all the house of Israel;
