the men of Coriantumr had received
sufficient strength that they could
walk, they were about to flee for
their lives; but behold, Shiz arose,
and also his men, and he swore in
his wrath that he would slay Coriantumr or he would perish by the
sword.

29 Wherefore, he did pursue them,
and on the morrow he did overtake
them; and they fought again with
the sword. And it came to pass that
when they had all fallen by the
sword, save it were Coriantumr and
Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with
the loss of blood.

30 And it came to pass that when
Coriantumr had leaned upon his
sword, that he rested a little, he
smote off the head of Shiz.

31 And it came to pass that after
he had smitten off the head of Shiz,

that Shiz raised up on his hands and
fell; and after that he had struggled for breath, he died.

32 And it came to pass that
Coriantumr fell to the earth, and
became as if he had no life.

33 And the Lord spake unto Ether,
and said unto him: Go forth. And
he went forth, and beheld that the
words of the Lord had all been fulfilled; and he finished his record;
(and the hundredth part I have
not written) and he hid them in a
manner that the people of Limhi
did find them.

34 Now the last words which are
written by Ether are these: Whether
the Lord will that I be translated,
or that I suffer the will of the Lord
in the flesh, it mattereth not, if it
so be that I am saved in the kingdom of God. Amen.

THE BOOK OF MORONI

CHAPTER 1

Moroni writes for the benefit of the Lamanitesâ€”
The Nephites who will not
deny Christ are put to death.
About A.D. 401-21.

Now I, Moroni, after having
made an end of abridging
the account of the people of
Jared, I had supposed not to have
written more, but I have not as yet
perished; and I make not myself
known to the Lamanites lest they
should destroy me.

2 For behold, their wars are exceedingly fierce among themselves;
and because of their hatred they
put to death every Nephite that
will not deny the Christ.

3 And I, Moroni, will not deny
the Christ; wherefore, I wander
whithersoever I can for the safety
of mine own life.

4 Wherefore, I write a few more
things, contrary to that which I
had supposed; for I had supposed
not to have written any more; but
I write a few more things, that perhaps they may be of worth unto
my brethren, the Lamanites, in some
future day, according to the will of
the Lord.

CHAPTER 2

Jesus gave the twelve Nephite disciples
power to confer the gift of the Holy
Ghost. About A.D. 401-21.
