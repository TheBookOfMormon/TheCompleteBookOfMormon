of the Holy Ghost, and the ministering
of angels.

18 And he spake plainly unto
them, that he had been deceived
by the power of the devil. And he
spake of hell, and of eternity, and
of eternal punishment.

19 And he said: I fear lest I have
committed the unpardonable sin,
for I have lied unto God; for I denied
the Christ, and said that I believed
the scriptures; and they truly
testify of him. And because I have
thus lied unto God I greatly fear
lest my case shall be awful; but I
confess unto God.

20 And it came to pass that when
he had said these words he could say
no more, and he gave up the ghost.

21 And when the multitude had
witnessed that he spake these things
as he was about to give up the ghost,
they were astonished exceedingly;
insomuch that the power of God
came down upon them, and they
were overcome that they fell to
the earth.

22 Now, this thing was pleasing
unto me, Jacob, for I had requested
it of my Father who was in heaven;
for he had heard my cry and answered
my prayer.

23 And it came to pass that peace
and the love of God was restored
again among the people; and they
searched the scriptures, and hearkened
no more to the words of this
wicked man.

24 And it came to pass that many
means were devised to reclaim
and restore the Lamanites to the
knowledge of the truth; but it all
was vain, for they delighted in
wars and bloodshed, and they had
an eternal hatred against us, their
brethren. And they sought by the
power of their arms to destroy us
continually.

25 Wherefore, the people of Nephi
did fortify against them with their
arms, and with all their might, trusting
in the God and rock of their
salvation; wherefore, they became
as yet, conquerors of their enemies.

26 And it came to pass that I,
Jacob, began to be old; and the
record of this people being kept on
the other plates of Nephi, wherefore,
I conclude this record, declaring
that I have written according to
the best of my knowledge, by saying
that the time passed away with
us, and also our lives passed away
like as it were unto us a dream, we
being a lonesome and a solemn
people, wanderers, cast out from
Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a
wilderness, and hated of our brethren,
which caused wars and contentions;
wherefore, we did mourn out
our days.

27 And I, Jacob, saw that I must
soon go down to my grave; wherefore,
I said unto my son Enos: Take
these plates. And I told him the
things which my brother Nephi
had commanded me, and he promised
obedience unto the commands.
And I make an end of my writing
upon these plates, which writing
has been small; and to the reader
I bid farewell, hoping that many of
my brethren may read my words.
Brethren, adieu.
