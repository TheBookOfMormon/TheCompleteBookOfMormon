FOURTH NEPHI
THE BOOK OF NEPHI

WHO IS THE SON OF NEPHI—ONE OF THE
DISCIPLES OF JESUS CHRIST

An account of the people of Nephi, according to his record.

The Nephites and the Lamanites are
all converted unto the Lord—They have
all things in common, work miracles,
and prosper in the land—After two centuries,
divisions, evils, false churches,
and persecutions arise—After three
hundred years, both the Nephites and
the Lamanites are wicked—Ammaron
hides up the sacred records. About
A.D. 35-321.

And it came to pass that the
thirty and fourth year passed
away, and also the thirty and
fifth, and behold the disciples of
Jesus had formed a church of Christ
in all the lands round about. And as
many as did come unto them, and
did truly repent of their sins, were
baptized in the name of Jesus; and
they did also receive the Holy Ghost.

2 And it came to pass in the thirty
and sixth year, the people were all
converted unto the Lord, upon all
the face of the land, both Nephites
and Lamanites, and there were no
contentions and disputations among
them, and every man did deal justly
one with another.

3 And they had all things common among them; therefore there
were not rich and poor, bond and
free, but they were all made free,
and partakers of the heavenly gift.

4 And it came to pass that the
thirty and seventh year passed away
also, and there still continued to be
peace in the land.

5 And there were great and marvelous works wrought by the disciples of Jesus, insomuch that
they did heal the sick, and raise
the dead, and cause the lame to
walk, and the blind to receive
their sight, and the deaf to hear;
and all manner of miracles did
they work among the children of
men; and in nothing did they work
miracles save it were in the name
of Jesus.

6 And thus did the thirty and
eighth year pass away, and also the
thirty and ninth, and forty and first,
and the forty and second, yea, even
until forty and nine years had passed
away, and also the fifty and first,
and the fifty and second; yea, and
even until fifty and nine years had
passed away.

7 And the Lord did prosper them
exceedingly in the land; yea, insomuch that they did build cities
again where there had been cities
burned.

8 Yea, even that great city Zarahemla
did they cause to be built
again.

9 But there were many cities which
had been sunk, and waters came
up in the stead thereof; therefore
these cities could not be renewed.

10 And now, behold, it came to pass
that the people of Nephi did wax
strong, and did multiply exceedingly
fast, and became an exceedingly fair
and delightsome people.
