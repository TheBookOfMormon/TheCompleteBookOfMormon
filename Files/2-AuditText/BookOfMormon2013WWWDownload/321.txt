was harrowed up by the memory
of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father
prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ,
a Son of God, to atone for the sins
of the world.

18 Now, as my mind caught hold
upon this thought, I cried within
my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God,
have mercy on me, who am in the
gall of bitterness, and am encircled
about by the everlasting chains of
death.

19 And now, behold, when I thought
this, I could remember my pains
no more; yea, I was harrowed up
by the memory of my sins no more.

20 And oh, what joy, and what
marvelous light I did behold; yea,
my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!

21 Yea, I say unto you, my son, that
there could be nothing so exquisite
and so bitter as were my pains. Yea,
and again I say unto you, my son,
that on the other hand, there can
be nothing so exquisite and sweet
as was my joy.

22 Yea, methought I saw, even as
our father Lehi saw, God sitting
upon his throne, surrounded with
numberless concourses of angels, in
the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul did

of which I did taste; that they might
also be born of God, and be filled
with the Holy Ghost.

25 Yea, and now behold, O my
son, the Lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my
labors;

26 For because of the word which
he has imparted unto me, behold,
many have been born of God, and
have tasted as I have tasted, and have
seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore they do know of these things of
which I have spoken, as I do know;
and the knowledge which I have
is of God.

27 And I have been supported under trials and troubles of every kind,
yea, and in all manner of afflictions;
yea, God has delivered me from
prison, and from bonds, and from
death; yea, and I do put my trust in
him, and he will still deliver me.

28 And I know that he will raise
me up at the last day, to dwell with
him in glory; yea, and I will praise
him forever, for he has brought
our fathers out of Egypt, and he
has swallowed up the Egyptians in
the Red Sea; and he led them by his
power into the promised land; yea,
and he has delivered them out of
