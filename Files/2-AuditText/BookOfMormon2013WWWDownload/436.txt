them and slay them; therefore Giddianhi gave commandment unto
his armies that in this year they
should go up to battle against the
Nephites.

7 And it came to pass that they did
come up to battle; and it was in the
sixth month; and behold, great and
terrible was the day that they did
come up to battle; and they were
girded about after the manner of
robbers; and they had a lamb-skin
about their loins, and they were
dyed in blood, and their heads were
shorn, and they had head-plates
upon them; and great and terrible
was the appearance of the armies of
Giddianhi, because of their armor,
and because of their being dyed
in blood.

8 And it came to pass that the
armies of the Nephites, when they
saw the appearance of the army
of Giddianhi, had all fallen to the
earth, and did lift their cries to the
Lord their God, that he would spare
them and deliver them out of the
hands of their enemies.

9 And it came to pass that when
the armies of Giddianhi saw this
they began to shout with a loud
voice, because of their joy, for they
had supposed that the Nephites had
fallen with fear because of the terror of their armies.

10 But in this thing they were
disappointed, for the Nephites did
not fear them; but they did fear
their God and did supplicate him
for protection; therefore, when the
armies of Giddianhi did rush upon
them they were prepared to meet
them; yea, in the strength of the
Lord they did receive them.

11 And the battle commenced in
this the sixth month; and great and
terrible was the battle thereof, yea,
great and terrible was the slaughter
thereof, insomuch that there never
was known so great a slaughter
among all the people of Lehi since
he left Jerusalem.

12 And notwithstanding the
threatenings and the oaths which
Giddianhi had made, behold, the
Nephites did beat them, insomuch
that they did fall back from before
them.

13 And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni
commanded that his armies
should pursue them as far as the
borders of the wilderness, and that
they should not spare any that
should fall into their hands by the
way; and thus they did pursue them
and did slay them, to the borders
of the wilderness, even until they
had fulfilled the commandment of
Gidgiddoni.

14 And it came to pass that Giddianhi, who had stood and fought
with boldness, was pursued as he
fled; and being weary because of
his much fighting he was overtaken
and slain. And thus was the end of
Giddianhi the robber.

15 And it came to pass that the
armies of the Nephites did return
again to their place of security. And
it came to pass that this nineteenth
year did pass away, and the robbers did not come again to battle;
neither did they come again in the
twentieth year.

16 And in the twenty and first year
they did not come up to battle, but
they came up on all sides to lay siege
round about the people of Nephi;
for they did suppose that if they
should cut off the people of Nephi
from their lands, and should hem
them in on every side, and if they
should cut them off from all their
outward privileges, that they could
cause them to yield themselves up
according to their wishes.

17 Now they had appointed unto
themselves another leader, whose
name was Zemnarihah; therefore
it was Zemnarihah that did cause
that this siege should take place.

18 But behold, this was an advantage to the Nephites; for it was
impossible for the robbers to lay
