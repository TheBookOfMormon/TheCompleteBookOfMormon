army of six thousand men, with a
sufficient quantity of food, should
be sent to the armies of Lehi and
Teancum. And it came to pass that
this was done to fortify the land
against the Lamanites.

14 And it came to pass that Moroni
and Pahoran, leaving a large body of
men in the land of Zarahemla, took
their march with a large body of
men towards the land of Nephihah,
being determined to overthrow the
Lamanites in that city.

15 And it came to pass that as they
were marching towards the land,
they took a large body of men of
the Lamanites, and slew many of
them, and took their provisions and
their weapons of war.

16 And it came to pass after they
had taken them, they caused them
to enter into a covenant that they
would no more take up their weapons of war against the Nephites.

17 And when they had entered
into this covenant they sent them to
dwell with the people of Ammon,
and they were in number about four
thousand who had not been slain.

18 And it came to pass that when
they had sent them away they pursued their march towards the land
of Nephihah. And it came to pass
that when they had come to the city
of Nephihah, they did pitch their
tents in the plains of Nephihah,
which is near the city of Nephihah.

19 Now Moroni was desirous that
the Lamanites should come out
to battle against them, upon the
plains; but the Lamanites, knowing
of their exceedingly great courage,
and beholding the greatness of
their numbers, therefore they durst
not come out against them; therefore they did not come to battle in
that day.

20 And when the night came,
Moroni went forth in the darkness
of the night, and came upon the
top of the wall to spy out in what
part of the city the Lamanites did
camp with their army.

21 And it came to pass that they
were on the east, by the entrance;
and they were all asleep. And now
Moroni returned to his army, and
caused that they should prepare
in haste strong cords and ladders,
to be let down from the top of the
wall into the inner part of the wall.

22 And it came to pass that Moroni
caused that his men should march
forth and come upon the top of the
wall, and let themselves down into
that part of the city, yea, even on
the west, where the Lamanites did
not camp with their armies.

23 And it came to pass that they
were all let down into the city by
night, by the means of their strong
cords and their ladders; thus when
the morning came they were all
within the walls of the city.

24 And now, when the Lamanites
awoke and saw that the armies of
Moroni were within the walls, they
were affrighted exceedingly, insomuch that they did flee out by
the pass.

25 And now when Moroni saw
that they were fleeing before him,
he did cause that his men should
march forth against them, and slew
many, and surrounded many others, and took them prisoners; and
the remainder of them fled into the
land of Moroni, which was in the
borders by the seashore.

26 Thus had Moroni and Pahoran
obtained the possession of the city
of Nephihah without the loss of one
soul; and there were many of the
Lamanites who were slain.

27 Now it came to pass that many
of the Lamanites that were prisoners
were desirous to join the people of
Ammon and become a free people.

28 And it came to pass that as many
as were desirous, unto them it was
granted according to their desires.

29 Therefore, all the prisoners of
