of the Lord, as the waters cover
the sea.

10 And in that day there shall be
a root of Jesse, which shall stand
for an ensign of the people; to it
shall the Gentiles seek; and his
rest shall be glorious.

11 And it shall come to pass in
that day that the Lord shall set his
hand again the second time to recover
the remnant of his people
which shall be left, from Assyria,
and from Egypt, and from Pathros,
and from Cush, and from Elam, and
from Shinar, and from Hamath,
and from the islands of the sea.

12 And he shall set up an ensign
for the nations, and shall assemble
the outcasts of Israel, and gather
together the dispersed of Judah
from the four corners of the earth.

13 The envy of Ephraim also shall
depart, and the adversaries of Judah
shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not
envy Judah, and Judah shall not
vex Ephraim.

14 But they shall fly upon the
shoulders of the Philistines towards
the west; they shall spoil them of
the east together; they shall lay
their hand upon Edom and Moab;
and the children of Ammon shall
obey them.

15 And the Lord shall utterly destroy
the tongue of the Egyptian
sea; and with his mighty wind
he shall shake his hand over the
river, and shall smite it in the seven
streams, and make men go over dry
shod.

16 And there shall be a highway
for the remnant of his people which
shall be left, from Assyria, like as
it was to Israel in the day that he
came up out of the land of Egypt.

CHAPTER 22

In the millennial day all men will praise
the Lord—He will dwell among them—
Compare Isaiah 12. About 559-545 B.C.

And in that day thou shalt say:
O Lord, I will praise thee; though
thou wast angry with me thine anger
is turned away, and thou comfortedst
me.

2 Behold, God is my salvation; I
will trust, and not be afraid; for
the Lord Jehovah is my strength
and my song; he also has become
my salvation.

3 Therefore, with joy shall ye draw
water out of the wells of salvation.

4 And in that day shall ye say:
Praise the Lord, call upon his name,
declare his doings among the people,
make mention that his name
is exalted.

5 Sing unto the Lord; for he hath
done excellent things; this is known
in all the earth.

6 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant
of Zion; for great is the Holy
One of Israel in the midst of thee.

CHAPTER 23

The destruction of Babylon is a type of
the destruction at the Second Coming—
It will be a day of wrath and vengeance
