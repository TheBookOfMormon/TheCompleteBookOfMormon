13 And the people of Ammon did
give unto the Nephites a large portion of their substance to support
their armies; and thus the Nephites
were compelled, alone, to withstand
against the Lamanites, who were a
compound of Laman and Lemuel,
and the sons of Ishmael, and all
those who had dissented from the
Nephites, who were Amalekites and
Zoramites, and the descendants of
the priests of Noah.

14 Now those descendants were
as numerous, nearly, as were the
Nephites; and thus the Nephites
were obliged to contend with their
brethren, even unto bloodshed.

15 And it came to pass as the
armies of the Lamanites had gathered together in the land of Antionum,
behold, the armies of the
Nephites were prepared to meet
them in the land of Jershon.

16 Now, the leader of the Nephites, or the man who had been
appointed to be the chief captain
over the Nephites—now the chief
captain took the command of all
the armies of the Nephites—and
his name was Moroni;

17 And Moroni took all the command, and the government of their
wars. And he was only twenty
and five years old when he was
appointed chief captain over the
armies of the Nephites.

18 And it came to pass that he met
the Lamanites in the borders of Jershon, and his people were armed
with swords, and with cimeters,
and all manner of weapons of war.

19 And when the armies of the
Lamanites saw that the people of
Nephi, or that Moroni, had prepared his people with breastplates
and with arm-shields, yea, and also
shields to defend their heads, and
also they were dressed with thick
clothing—

20 Now the army of Zerahemnah
was not prepared with any such
thing; they had only their swords
and their cimeters, their bows and
their arrows, their stones and their
slings; and they were naked, save
it were a skin which was girded
about their loins; yea, all were naked, save it were the Zoramites and
the Amalekites;

21 But they were not armed with
breastplates, nor shields—therefore,
they were exceedingly afraid of the
armies of the Nephites because of
their armor, notwithstanding their
number being so much greater than
the Nephites.

22 Behold, now it came to pass
that they durst not come against
the Nephites in the borders of Jershon; therefore they departed out
of the land of Antionum into the
wilderness, and took their journey
round about in the wilderness, away
by the head of the river Sidon, that
they might come into the land of
Manti and take possession of the
land; for they did not suppose that
the armies of Moroni would know
whither they had gone.

23 But it came to pass, as soon as
they had departed into the wilderness Moroni sent spies into the wilderness to watch their camp; and
Moroni, also, knowing of the prophecies
of Alma, sent certain men unto
him, desiring him that he should
inquire of the Lord whither the
armies of the Nephites should go
to defend themselves against the
Lamanites.

24 And it came to pass that the
word of the Lord came unto Alma,
and Alma informed the messengers
of Moroni, that the armies of the
