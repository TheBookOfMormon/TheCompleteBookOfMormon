or to cast them into prison, or to
cast them out of his land, according
to his will and pleasure.

21 And thus Ammon was carried
before the king who was over the
land of Ishmael; and his name was
Lamoni; and he was a descendant
of Ishmael.

22 And the king inquired of Ammon if it were his desire to dwell
in the land among the Lamanites,
or among his people.

23 And Ammon said unto him:
Yea, I desire to dwell among this
people for a time; yea, and perhaps
until the day I die.

24 And it came to pass that king
Lamoni was much pleased with
Ammon, and caused that his bands
should be loosed; and he would
that Ammon should take one of his
daughters to wife.

25 But Ammon said unto him: Nay,
but I will be thy servant. Therefore
Ammon became a servant to king
Lamoni. And it came to pass that
he was set among other servants to
watch the flocks of Lamoni, according to the custom of the Lamanites.

26 And after he had been in the
service of the king three days, as he
was with the Lamanitish servants
going forth with their flocks to the
place of water, which was called
the water of Sebus, and all the Lamanites drive their flocks hither,
that they may have waterâ€”

27 Therefore, as Ammon and the
servants of the king were driving
forth their flocks to this place of
water, behold, a certain number of
the Lamanites, who had been with
their flocks to water, stood and
scattered the flocks of Ammon and
the servants of the king, and they
scattered them insomuch that they
fled many ways.

28 Now the servants of the king
began to murmur, saying: Now
the king will slay us, as he has our
brethren because their flocks were
scattered by the wickedness of these
men. And they began to weep exceedingly, saying: Behold, our flocks
are scattered already.

29 Now they wept because of the
fear of being slain. Now when Ammon saw this his heart was swollen
within him with joy; for, said he,
I will show forth my power unto
these my fellow-servants, or the
power which is in me, in restoring
these flocks unto the king, that I
may win the hearts of these my
fellow-servants, that I may lead
them to believe in my words.

30 And now, these were the
thoughts of Ammon, when he saw
the afflictions of those whom he
termed to be his brethren.

31 And it came to pass that he flattered them by his words, saying: My
brethren, be of good cheer and let
us go in search of the flocks, and
we will gather them together and
bring them back unto the place of
water; and thus we will preserve
the flocks unto the king and he
will not slay us.

32 And it came to pass that they
went in search of the flocks, and
they did follow Ammon, and they
rushed forth with much swiftness
and did head the flocks of the
king, and did gather them together
again to the place of water.

33 And those men again stood to
scatter their flocks; but Ammon
said unto his brethren: Encircle
the flocks round about that they
flee not; and I go and contend with
these men who do scatter our flocks.

34 Therefore, they did as Ammon
commanded them, and he went forth
and stood to contend with those
who stood by the waters of Sebus;
and they were in number not a few.

35 Therefore they did not fear
Ammon, for they supposed that
one of their men could slay him
according to their pleasure, for
they knew not that the Lord had
