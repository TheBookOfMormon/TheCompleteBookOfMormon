Abinadi, and they sought from that
time forward to take him. And king
Noah hardened his heart against
the word of the Lord, and he did
not repent of his evil doings.

CHAPTER 12

Abinadi is imprisoned for prophesying
the destruction of the people and the
death of King Noah—The false priests
quote the scriptures and pretend to keep
the law of Moses—Abinadi begins to
teach them the Ten Commandments.
About 148 B.C.

And it came to pass that after the
space of two years that Abinadi came
among them in disguise, that they
knew him not, and began to prophesy
among them, saying: Thus has
the Lord commanded me, saying—
Abinadi, go and prophesy unto this
my people, for they have hardened
their hearts against my words; they
have repented not of their evil doings;
therefore, I will visit them in
my anger, yea, in my fierce anger
will I visit them in their iniquities
and abominations.

2 Yea, wo be unto this generation!
And the Lord said unto me: Stretch
forth thy hand and prophesy, saying:
Thus saith the Lord, it shall come to
pass that this generation, because
of their iniquities, shall be brought
into bondage, and shall be smitten
on the cheek; yea, and shall be
driven by men, and shall be slain;
and the vultures of the air, and the
dogs, yea, and the wild beasts, shall
devour their flesh.

3 And it shall come to pass that the
life of king Noah shall be valued
even as a garment in a hot furnace;
for he shall know that I am the Lord.

4 And it shall come to pass that
I will smite this my people with
sore afflictions, yea, with famine
and with pestilence; and I will
cause that they shall howl all the
day long.

5 Yea, and I will cause that they
shall have burdens lashed upon
their backs; and they shall be driven
before like a dumb ass.

6 And it shall come to pass that I
will send forth hail among them,
and it shall smite them; and they
shall also be smitten with the east
wind; and insects shall pester their
land also, and devour their grain.

7 And they shall be smitten with a
great pestilence—and all this will I
do because of their iniquities and
abominations.

8 And it shall come to pass that
except they repent I will utterly destroy
them from off the face of the
earth; yet they shall leave a record
behind them, and I will preserve
them for other nations which shall
possess the land; yea, even this will
I do that I may discover the abominations
of this people to other nations.
And many things did Abinadi
prophesy against this people.

9 And it came to pass that they
were angry with him; and they took
him and carried him bound before
the king, and said unto the king:
Behold, we have brought a man before
thee who has prophesied evil
concerning thy people, and saith
that God will destroy them.

10 And he also prophesieth evil
concerning thy life, and saith that
thy life shall be as a garment in a
furnace of fire.

11 And again, he saith that thou
shalt be as a stalk, even as a dry stalk
