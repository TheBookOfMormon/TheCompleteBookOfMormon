Christ, (among whom were the three
disciples of Jesus who should tarry)
were called Nephites, and Jacobites,
and Josephites, and Zoramites.

38 And it came to pass that they
who rejected the gospel were called
Lamanites, and Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites; and they did not dwindle
in unbelief, but they did wilfully
rebel against the gospel of Christ;
and they did teach their children
that they should not believe, even
as their fathers, from the beginning,
did dwindle.

39 And it was because of the
wickedness and abomination of
their fathers, even as it was in the
beginning. And they were taught
to hate the children of God, even
as the Lamanites were taught to
hate the children of Nephi from
the beginning.

40 And it came to pass that two
hundred and forty and four years
had passed away, and thus were the
affairs of the people. And the more
wicked part of the people did wax
strong, and became exceedingly
more numerous than were the people of God.

41 And they did still continue to
build up churches unto themselves,
and adorn them with all manner
of precious things. And thus did
two hundred and fifty years pass
away, and also two hundred and
sixty years.

42 And it came to pass that the
wicked part of the people began
again to build up the secret oaths
and combinations of Gadianton.

43 And also the people who were
called the people of Nephi began to
be proud in their hearts, because of
their exceeding riches, and become
vain like unto their brethren, the
Lamanites.

44 And from this time the disciples began to sorrow for the sins
of the world.

45 And it came to pass that when
three hundred years had passed
away, both the people of Nephi
and the Lamanites had become
exceedingly wicked one like unto
another.

46 And it came to pass that the robbers of Gadianton did spread over
all the face of the land; and there
were none that were righteous save
it were the disciples of Jesus. And
gold and silver did they lay up in
store in abundance, and did traffic
in all manner of traffic.

47 And it came to pass that after
three hundred and five years had
passed away, (and the people did
still remain in wickedness) Amos
died; and his brother, Ammaron,
did keep the record in his stead.

48 And it came to pass that when
three hundred and twenty years
had passed away, Ammaron, being
constrained by the Holy Ghost, did
hide up the records which were
sacred—yea, even all the sacred
records which had been handed
down from generation to generation,
which were sacred—even until the
three hundred and twentieth year
from the coming of Christ.

49 And he did hide them up unto
the Lord, that they might come
again unto the remnant of the house
of Jacob, according to the prophecies and the promises of the Lord.
And thus is the end of the record
of Ammaron.
