Lord began to bless them, insomuch
that they brought many to the
knowledge of the truth; yea, they
did convince many of their sins,
and of the traditions of their fathers,
which were not correct.

18 And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni returned from
the land of Middoni to the land
of Ishmael, which was the land of
their inheritance.

19 And king Lamoni would not
suffer that Ammon should serve
him, or be his servant.

20 But he caused that there should
be synagogues built in the land
of Ishmael; and he caused that his
people, or the people who were
under his reign, should assemble
themselves together.

21 And he did rejoice over them,
and he did teach them many things.
And he did also declare unto them
that they were a people who were
under him, and that they were a
free people, that they were free
from the oppressions of the king,
his father; for that his father had
granted unto him that he might
reign over the people who were in
the land of Ishmael, and in all the
land round about.

22 And he also declared unto them
that they might have the liberty
of worshiping the Lord their God
according to their desires, in whatsoever place they were in, if it were
in the land which was under the
reign of king Lamoni.

23 And Ammon did preach unto
the people of king Lamoni; and
it came to pass that he did teach
them all things concerning things
pertaining to righteousness. And
he did exhort them daily, with all
diligence; and they gave heed unto
his word, and they were zealous for
keeping the commandments of God.

CHAPTER 22

Aaron teaches Lamoni's father about
the Creation, the Fall of Adam, and the
plan of redemption through Christ—
The king and all his household are
converted—The division of the land between the Nephites and the Lamanites
is explained. About 90-77 B.C.

Now, as Ammon was thus teaching
the people of Lamoni continually,
we will return to the account of
Aaron and his brethren; for after he
departed from the land of Middoni
he was led by the Spirit to the land
of Nephi, even to the house of the
king which was over all the land
save it were the land of Ishmael;
and he was the father of Lamoni.

2 And it came to pass that he went
in unto him into the king's palace,
with his brethren, and bowed himself before the king, and said unto
him: Behold, O king, we are the
brethren of Ammon, whom thou
hast delivered out of prison.

3 And now, O king, if thou wilt
spare our lives, we will be thy
servants. And the king said unto
them: Arise, for I will grant unto
you your lives, and I will not suffer
that ye shall be my servants; but I
will insist that ye shall administer
unto me; for I have been somewhat
troubled in mind because of the
generosity and the greatness of
the words of thy brother Ammon;
and I desire to know the cause why
he has not come up out of Middoni
with thee.

4 And Aaron said unto the king:
Behold, the Spirit of the Lord has
called him another way; he has gone
to the land of Ishmael, to teach the
people of Lamoni.

5 Now the king said unto them:
What is this that ye have said
concerning the Spirit of the Lord?
