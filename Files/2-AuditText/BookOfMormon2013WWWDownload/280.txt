of the king. And there came a multitude, and to their astonishment,
they beheld the king, and the queen,
and their servants prostrate upon
the earth, and they all lay there as
though they were dead; and they
also saw Ammon, and behold, he
was a Nephite.

19 And now the people began to
murmur among themselves; some
saying that it was a great evil that
had come upon them, or upon the
king and his house, because he had
suffered that the Nephite should
remain in the land.

20 But others rebuked them, saying: The king hath brought this evil
upon his house, because he slew his
servants who had had their flocks
scattered at the waters of Sebus.

21 And they were also rebuked
by those men who had stood at the
waters of Sebus and scattered the
flocks which belonged to the king,
for they were angry with Ammon
because of the number which he
had slain of their brethren at the
waters of Sebus, while defending
the flocks of the king.

22 Now, one of them, whose brother
had been slain with the sword of
Ammon, being exceedingly angry
with Ammon, drew his sword and
went forth that he might let it fall
upon Ammon, to slay him; and as
he lifted the sword to smite him,
behold, he fell dead.

23 Now we see that Ammon could
not be slain, for the Lord had said
unto Mosiah, his father: I will spare
him, and it shall be unto him according to thy faithâ€”therefore,
Mosiah trusted him unto the Lord.

24 And it came to pass that when
the multitude beheld that the man
had fallen dead, who lifted the
sword to slay Ammon, fear came
upon them all, and they durst not
put forth their hands to touch him
or any of those who had fallen; and
they began to marvel again among
themselves what could be the cause
of this great power, or what all these
things could mean.

25 And it came to pass that there
were many among them who said
that Ammon was the Great Spirit,
and others said he was sent by the
Great Spirit;

26 But others rebuked them all,
saying that he was a monster, who
had been sent from the Nephites to
torment them.

27 And there were some who said
that Ammon was sent by the Great
Spirit to afflict them because of
their iniquities; and that it was
the Great Spirit that had always attended the Nephites, who had ever
delivered them out of their hands;
and they said that it was this Great
Spirit who had destroyed so many
of their brethren, the Lamanites.

28 And thus the contention began to be exceedingly sharp among
them. And while they were thus
contending, the woman servant
who had caused the multitude to
be gathered together came, and
when she saw the contention which
was among the multitude she was
exceedingly sorrowful, even unto
tears.

29 And it came to pass that she
went and took the queen by the
hand, that perhaps she might raise
her from the ground; and as soon
as she touched her hand she arose
and stood upon her feet, and cried
with a loud voice, saying: O blessed
Jesus, who has saved me from an
awful hell! O blessed God, have
mercy on this people!

30 And when she had said this, she
clasped her hands, being filled with
joy, speaking many words which
were not understood; and when she
had done this, she took the king,
