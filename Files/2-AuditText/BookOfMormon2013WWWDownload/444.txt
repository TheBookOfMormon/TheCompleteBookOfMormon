people that they had been wrought
upon by the Spirit of God, and had
been healed; and they did show
forth signs also and did do some
miracles among the people.

23 Thus passed away the thirty
and second year also. And Nephi
did cry unto the people in the commencement of the thirty and third
year; and he did preach unto them
repentance and remission of sins.

24 Now I would have you to remember also, that there were none
who were brought unto repentance
who were not baptized with water.

25 Therefore, there were ordained
of Nephi, men unto this ministry,
that all such as should come unto
them should be baptized with water, and this as a witness and a testimony before God, and unto the
people, that they had repented and
received a remission of their sins.

26 And there were many in the
commencement of this year that
were baptized unto repentance;
and thus the more part of the year
did pass away.

CHAPTER 8

Tempests, earthquakes, fires, whirlwinds, and physical upheavals attest
the crucifixion of Christ—Many people
are destroyed—Darkness covers the
land for three days—Those who remain
bemoan their fate. About A.D. 33-34.

And now it came to pass that according to our record, and we know
our record to be true, for behold,
it was a just man who did keep
the record—for he truly did many
miracles in the name of Jesus; and
there was not any man who could
do a miracle in the name of Jesus
save he were cleansed every whit
from his iniquity—

2 And now it came to pass, if
there was no mistake made by
this man in the reckoning of our
time, the thirty and third year had
passed away;

3 And the people began to look
with great earnestness for the sign
which had been given by the prophet
Samuel, the Lamanite, yea, for the
time that there should be darkness
for the space of three days over the
face of the land.

4 And there began to be great
doubtings and disputations among
the people, notwithstanding so
many signs had been given.

5 And it came to pass in the thirty
and fourth year, in the first month,
on the fourth day of the month,
there arose a great storm, such an
one as never had been known in all
the land.

6 And there was also a great and
terrible tempest; and there was terrible thunder, insomuch that it did
shake the whole earth as if it was
about to divide asunder.

7 And there were exceedingly
sharp lightnings, such as never had
been known in all the land.

8 And the city of Zarahemla did
take fire.

9 And the city of Moroni did sink
into the depths of the sea, and the
inhabitants thereof were drowned.

10 And the earth was carried up
upon the city of Moronihah, that in
the place of the city there became
a great mountain.
