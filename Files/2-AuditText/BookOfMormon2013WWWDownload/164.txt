their language had become corrupted;
and they had brought no
records with them; and they denied
the being of their Creator; and
Mosiah, nor the people of Mosiah,
could understand them.

18 But it came to pass that Mosiah
caused that they should be taught
in his language. And it came to
pass that after they were taught in
the language of Mosiah, Zarahemla
gave a genealogy of his fathers, according
to his memory; and they
are written, but not in these plates.

19 And it came to pass that the
people of Zarahemla, and of Mosiah,
did unite together; and Mosiah was
appointed to be their king.

20 And it came to pass in the days
of Mosiah, there was a large stone
brought unto him with engravings
on it; and he did interpret the
engravings by the gift and power
of God.

21 And they gave an account of
one Coriantumr, and the slain of
his people. And Coriantumr was
discovered by the people of Zarahemla;
and he dwelt with them for
the space of nine moons.

22 It also spake a few words concerning
his fathers. And his first
parents came out from the tower,
at the time the Lord confounded
the language of the people; and the
severity of the Lord fell upon them
according to his judgments, which
are just; and their bones lay scattered
in the land northward.

23 Behold, I, Amaleki, was born in
the days of Mosiah; and I have lived
to see his death; and Benjamin, his
son, reigneth in his stead.

24 And behold, I have seen, in the
days of king Benjamin, a serious war
and much bloodshed between the
Nephites and the Lamanites. But
behold, the Nephites did obtain
much advantage over them; yea,
insomuch that king Benjamin did
drive them out of the land of Zarahemla.

25 And it came to pass that I began
to be old; and, having no seed, and
knowing king Benjamin to be a just
man before the Lord, wherefore, I
shall deliver up these plates unto
him, exhorting all men to come
unto God, the Holy One of Israel,
and believe in prophesying, and in
revelations, and in the ministering
of angels, and in the gift of speaking
with tongues, and in the gift of
interpreting languages, and in all
things which are good; for there is
nothing which is good save it comes
from the Lord: and that which is
evil cometh from the devil.

26 And now, my beloved brethren,
I would that ye should come unto
Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel,
and partake of his salvation, and
the power of his redemption. Yea,
come unto him, and offer your
whole souls as an offering unto him,
and continue in fasting and praying,
and endure to the end; and as
the Lord liveth ye will be saved.

27 And now I would speak somewhat
concerning a certain number
who went up into the wilderness to
return to the land of Nephi; for
there was a large number who were
desirous to possess the land of their
inheritance.

28 Wherefore, they went up into
