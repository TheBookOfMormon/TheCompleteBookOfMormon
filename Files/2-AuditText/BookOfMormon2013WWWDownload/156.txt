these things; for I truly had seen
angels, and they had ministered
unto me. And also, I had heard the
voice of the Lord speaking unto me
in very word, from time to time;
wherefore, I could not be shaken.

6 And it came to pass that he came
unto me, and on this wise did he
speak unto me, saying: Brother Jacob,
I have sought much opportunity
that I might speak unto you;
for I have heard and also know that
thou goest about much, preaching
that which ye call the gospel, or
the doctrine of Christ.

7 And ye have led away much of
this people that they pervert the
right way of God, and keep not
the law of Moses which is the right
way; and convert the law of Moses
into the worship of a being which
ye say shall come many hundred
years hence. And now behold, I,
Sherem, declare unto you that this
is blasphemy; for no man knoweth
of such things; for he cannot tell of
things to come. And after this manner
did Sherem contend against me.

8 But behold, the Lord God poured
in his Spirit into my soul, insomuch
that I did confound him in
all his words.

9 And I said unto him: Deniest thou
the Christ who shall come? And he
said: If there should be a Christ, I
would not deny him; but I know
that there is no Christ, neither has
been, nor ever will be.

10 And I said unto him: Believest
thou the scriptures? And he said,
Yea.

11 And I said unto him: Then ye do
not understand them; for they truly
testify of Christ. Behold, I say unto
you that none of the prophets have
written, nor prophesied, save they
have spoken concerning this Christ.

12 And this is not allâ€”it has been
made manifest unto me, for I have
heard and seen; and it also has been
made manifest unto me by the
power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore,
I know if there should be no
atonement made all mankind must
be lost.

13 And it came to pass that he
said unto me: Show me a sign by
this power of the Holy Ghost, in the
which ye know so much.

14 And I said unto him: What am
I that I should tempt God to show
unto thee a sign in the thing which
thou knowest to be true? Yet thou
wilt deny it, because thou art of the
devil. Nevertheless, not my will be
done; but if God shall smite thee,
let that be a sign unto thee that
he has power, both in heaven and
in earth; and also, that Christ shall
come. And thy will, O Lord, be done,
and not mine.

15 And it came to pass that when I,
Jacob, had spoken these words, the
power of the Lord came upon him,
insomuch that he fell to the earth.
And it came to pass that he was nourished
for the space of many days.

16 And it came to pass that he said
unto the people: Gather together on
the morrow, for I shall die; wherefore,
I desire to speak unto the
people before I shall die.

17 And it came to pass that on the
morrow the multitude were gathered
together; and he spake plainly
unto them and denied the things
which he had taught them, and
confessed the Christ, and the power
