10 And remember also the words
which Amulek spake unto Zeezrom, in the city of Ammonihah;
for he said unto him that the Lord
surely should come to redeem his
people, but that he should not come
to redeem them in their sins, but to
redeem them from their sins.

11 And he hath power given unto
him from the Father to redeem
them from their sins because of repentance; therefore he hath sent
his angels to declare the tidings
of the conditions of repentance,
which bringeth unto the power of
the Redeemer, unto the salvation of
their souls.

12 And now, my sons, remember,
remember that it is upon the rock
of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the
Son of God, that ye must build your
foundation; that when the devil
shall send forth his mighty winds,
yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea,
when all his hail and his mighty
storm shall beat upon you, it shall
have no power over you to drag you
down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon
which ye are built, which is a sure
foundation, a foundation whereon
if men build they cannot fall.

13 And it came to pass that these
were the words which Helaman
taught to his sons; yea, he did
teach them many things which are
not written, and also many things
which are written.

14 And they did remember his
words; and therefore they went
forth, keeping the commandments
of God, to teach the word of God
among all the people of Nephi, beginning at the city Bountiful;

15 And from thenceforth to the
city of Gid; and from the city of
Gid to the city of Mulek;

16 And even from one city to another, until they had gone forth
among all the people of Nephi
who were in the land southward;
and from thence into the land of
Zarahemla, among the Lamanites.

17 And it came to pass that they
did preach with great power, insomuch that they did confound many
of those dissenters who had gone
over from the Nephites, insomuch
that they came forth and did confess their sins and were baptized
unto repentance, and immediately
returned to the Nephites to endeavor
to repair unto them the wrongs
which they had done.

18 And it came to pass that Nephi
and Lehi did preach unto the Lamanites with such great power and authority, for they had power and authority
given unto them that they might
speak, and they also had what they
should speak given unto themâ€”

19 Therefore they did speak unto
the great astonishment of the Lamanites, to the convincing them,
insomuch that there were eight thousand of the Lamanites who were in
the land of Zarahemla and round
about baptized unto repentance,
and were convinced of the wickedness of the traditions of their
fathers.

20 And it came to pass that Nephi
and Lehi did proceed from thence
to go to the land of Nephi.

21 And it came to pass that they
were taken by an army of the Lamanites and cast into prison; yea,
even in that same prison in which
Ammon and his brethren were cast
by the servants of Limhi.
