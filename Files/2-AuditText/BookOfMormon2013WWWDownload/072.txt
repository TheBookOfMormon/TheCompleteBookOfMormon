oppress thee with their own flesh;
they shall be drunken with their
own blood as with sweet wine; and
all flesh shall know that I, the Lord,
am thy Savior and thy Redeemer,
the Mighty One of Jacob.

CHAPTER 22

Israel will be scattered upon all the face
of the earth—The Gentiles will nurse
and nourish Israel with the gospel in
the last days—Israel will be gathered
and saved, and the wicked will burn as
stubble—The kingdom of the devil will
be destroyed, and Satan will be bound.

And now it came to pass that after I,
Nephi, had read these things which
were engraven upon the plates of
brass, my brethren came unto me
and said unto me: What meaneth
these things which ye have read?
Behold, are they to be understood
according to things which are spiritual,
which shall come to pass according
to the spirit and not the
flesh?

2 And I, Nephi, said unto them:
Behold they were manifest unto
the prophet by the voice of the
Spirit; for by the Spirit are all
things made known unto the prophets,
which shall come upon the
children of men according to the
flesh.

3 Wherefore, the things of which
I have read are things pertaining
to things both temporal and spiritual;
for it appears that the house
of Israel, sooner or later, will be
scattered upon all the face of the

to and fro upon the isles of
the sea; and whither they are none

that they have been led away.

5 And since they have been led
away, these things have been prophesied
concerning them, and
also concerning all those who shall
hereafter be scattered and be confounded,
because of the Holy One
of Israel; for against him will they
harden their hearts; wherefore,
they shall be scattered among
all nations and shall be hated of
all men.

6 Nevertheless, after they shall be
nursed by the Gentiles, and the
Lord has lifted up his hand upon
the Gentiles and set them up for a
standard, and their children have
been carried in their arms, and
their daughters have been carried
upon their shoulders, behold these
things of which are spoken are temporal;
for thus are the covenants
of the Lord with our fathers; and
it meaneth us in the days to come,
and also all our brethren who are
of the house of Israel.

7 And it meaneth that the time
cometh that after all the house of
Israel have been scattered and confounded,
that the Lord God will
raise up a mighty nation among the
Gentiles, yea, even upon the face
of this land; and by them shall our
seed be scattered.
