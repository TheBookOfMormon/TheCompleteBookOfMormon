and they were exceedingly valiant
for courage, and also for strength
and activity; but behold, this was
not all—they were men who were
true at all times in whatsoever thing
they were entrusted.

21 Yea, they were men of truth and
soberness, for they had been taught
to keep the commandments of God
and to walk uprightly before him.

22 And now it came to pass that
Helaman did march at the head of
his two thousand stripling soldiers,
to the support of the people in the
borders of the land on the south by
the west sea.

23 And thus ended the twenty
and eighth year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi.

CHAPTER 54

Ammoron and Moroni negotiate for the
exchange of prisoners—Moroni demands
that the Lamanites withdraw and cease
their murderous attacks—Ammoron
demands that the Nephites lay down
their arms and become subject to the
Lamanites. About 63 B.C.

And now it came to pass in the commencement of the twenty and ninth
year of the judges, that Ammoron
sent unto Moroni desiring that he
would exchange prisoners.

2 And it came to pass that Moroni
felt to rejoice exceedingly at this
request, for he desired the provisions which were imparted for the
support of the Lamanite prisoners
for the support of his own people; and he also desired his own
people for the strengthening of
his army.

3 Now the Lamanites had taken
many women and children, and
there was not a woman nor a child
among all the prisoners of Moroni,
or the prisoners whom Moroni had
taken; therefore Moroni resolved
upon a stratagem to obtain as many
prisoners of the Nephites from the
Lamanites as it were possible.

4 Therefore he wrote an epistle,
and sent it by the servant of Ammoron, the same who had brought
an epistle to Moroni. Now these
are the words which he wrote unto
Ammoron, saying:

5 Behold, Ammoron, I have written
unto you somewhat concerning this
war which ye have waged against
my people, or rather which thy
brother hath waged against them,
and which ye are still determined
to carry on after his death.

6 Behold, I would tell you somewhat concerning the justice of
God, and the sword of his almighty
wrath, which doth hang over you
except ye repent and withdraw your
armies into your own lands, or the
land of your possessions, which is
the land of Nephi.

7 Yea, I would tell you these things
if ye were capable of hearkening
unto them; yea, I would tell you
concerning that awful hell that
awaits to receive such murderers
as thou and thy brother have been,
except ye repent and withdraw
your murderous purposes, and
return with your armies to your
own lands.

8 But as ye have once rejected these
things, and have fought against the
people of the Lord, even so I may
expect you will do it again.

9 And now behold, we are prepared
to receive you; yea, and except you
withdraw your purposes, behold, ye
will pull down the wrath of that
God whom you have rejected upon
you, even to your utter destruction.

10 But, as the Lord liveth, our
armies shall come upon you except
ye withdraw, and ye shall soon be
visited with death, for we will retain our cities and our lands; yea,
