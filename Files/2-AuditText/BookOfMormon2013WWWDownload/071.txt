12 And then, O house of Israel,
behold, these shall come from far;
and lo, these from the north and
from the west; and these from the
land of Sinim.

13 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful,
O earth; for the feet of those
who are in the east shall be established;
and break forth into singing,
O mountains; for they shall be
smitten no more; for the Lord hath
comforted his people, and will have
mercy upon his afflicted.

14 But, behold, Zion hath said:
The Lord hath forsaken me, and
my Lord hath forgotten meâ€”but he
will show that he hath not.

15 For can a woman forget her
sucking child, that she should not
have compassion on the son of
her womb? Yea, they may forget,
yet will I not forget thee, O house
of Israel.

16 Behold, I have graven thee upon
the palms of my hands; thy walls
are continually before me.

17 Thy children shall make haste
against thy destroyers; and they
that made thee waste shall go
forth of thee.

18 Lift up thine eyes round about
and behold; all these gather themselves
together, and they shall come
to thee. And as I live, saith the Lord,
thou shalt surely clothe thee with
them all, as with an ornament, and
bind them on even as a bride.

21 Then shalt thou say in thine
heart: Who hath begotten me these,
seeing I have lost my children, and
am desolate, a captive, and removing
to and fro? And who hath
brought up these? Behold, I was
left alone; these, where have they
been?

22 Thus saith the Lord God: Behold,
I will lift up mine hand to the
Gentiles, and set up my standard
to the people; and they shall bring
thy sons in their arms, and thy
daughters shall be carried upon
their shoulders.

23 And kings shall be thy nursing
fathers, and their queens thy nursing
mothers; they shall bow down
to thee with their face towards the
earth, and lick up the dust of thy
feet; and thou shalt know that I
am the Lord; for they shall not be
ashamed that wait for me.

24 For shall the prey be taken from
the mighty, or the lawful captives
delivered?

25 But thus saith the Lord, even
the captives of the mighty shall
be taken away, and the prey of
the terrible shall be delivered; for
I will contend with him that contendeth
with thee, and I will save
thy children.

26 And I will feed them that
