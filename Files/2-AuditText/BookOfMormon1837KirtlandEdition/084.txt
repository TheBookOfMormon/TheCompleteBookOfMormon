And it shall come to pass, that when all men shall
have passed from this first death unto life, insomuch
as they have become immortal, they must appear be-
fore the judgment seat of the Holy One of Israel; and
then cometh the judgment, and then must they be
judged according to the holy judgment of God. And
assuredly, as the Lord liveth, for the Lord God hath
spoken it, and it is his eternal word, which. cannnot
pass away, that they who are righteous, shall be right-
