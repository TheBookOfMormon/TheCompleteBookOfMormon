upon the face.of all the earth, amongall the nations
of the Gentiles, to fight against the Lamb of God.

And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the pow-
er of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the
saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the cove-
nant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all
the face of the earth; and they were armed with right-
eousness and with the power of God in great glory.

And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of
God was poured out upon the.great and abominable

Jew; and at the time they proceeded out of the mouth
of the Jew, or, at the time the book proceeded out of
the mouth of the Jew, the things which were written,
were plain and pure, and most precious, and easy to
the understanding of all men. And behold, the things
which this apostle of the Lamb shall write, are many
things which thou hast seen; and behold, the remain-

hereafter, thou shalt not write; for the Lord God hath
ordained the apostle of the Lamb of God, that he
should write them. And also others who have been,
