brethren, is it expedient that I should awake you to
an awful reality of these things? Would I harrow up
your souls, if your minds were pure? Would I be
plain unto you according to the plainness of the truth,
if ye were freed from sin? Behold, if ye were holy,
I would speak unto you of holiness; but as ye are
not holy, and ye look upon me asa teacher, it must
needs be expedient that I teach you the consequences
of sin. Behold, my soul abhorreth sin, and my heart
delighteth in righteousness; and I will praise the ho-
ly name of my God. Come, my brethren, every one
that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that
hath ne money, come buy and eat; yea, come buy
wine and milk without money and without price. .
Wherefore, do not spend money for that which: is of
no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot satis-
fy. Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the
words which I have spoken; and come unto the Hol
One of Israel, and feast upon that whieh perishet
not, neither cam be corrupted, and let your soul de-
light in fatness. Behold, nsy beloved brethren, -re-
member the words of your God; pray unto him con-
tinually by day, and give thanks unto his holy name
by night. Let your hearts rejoice, and behold how
great the covenants of the Lord, and how great his
condescensions unto the children of men; and because
of his greatness, and his grace and mercy, he has
premised unto us that our seed shall not utterly bedes-
troyed, according to the flesh, but that he would pre-
serve them; and in future generations, they shall be-
come a righteous branch unto the house of Israel.

And now, my brethren, I would speak unte you
more; but on the morrow I will declare unto you the
remaindey of my words. Amen,

.

CHAPTER VII.

AnD now I, Jacob, speak unto you again, my beloy-
ed brethren, concerning this righteous branch of
which I have spoken. For behold, the promises which
we have obtained, are promises unto us according to

the flesh; wherefore, as it has been shown unto me
