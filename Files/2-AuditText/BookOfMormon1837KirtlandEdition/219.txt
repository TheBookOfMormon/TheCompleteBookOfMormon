edagain. And he also read the account of Alma and
his brethren, and all their afflictions,: from the time
they left the land of Zarahemla,. until the time they
returned again. And now when Mosiah had. made an
end of reading the records, his people who tarried:din
the land were struck with wonder and amazement, for
they knew not what to think; for when they beheld
those that had been delivered out of bondage, they
