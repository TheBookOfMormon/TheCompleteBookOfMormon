to be a cunning and a wise people, as to the wisdom
of the world; yea, a very cunning people; delighting
in all manner of wickedness and plunder, except it
were among their own brethren.

And now it came to pass that Amulon began to ex-
ercise authority over Alma and his brethren, and be-
gan to. persecute him, and cause that his children
should persecute their children: for Amulon knew Al-
ina, that->he had been one of the kingâ€™s priests, and
that it. was he that believed the words of Abinadi, and
was driven out before the king; and therefore he was
wroth with him, for he was subject.to king Laman;

upon them, and put task-masters over them. And it

put to death. And Alma and his people did not raise
their voices tothe Lord their God, but did pour out
their hearts to him; and he did know the thoughts of
their hearts. :

which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant.
