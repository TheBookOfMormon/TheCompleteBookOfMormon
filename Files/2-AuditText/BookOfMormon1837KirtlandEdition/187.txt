And now I, Zeniff, after having told all these things
unto my. people concerning the Lamanites,'I did stim-
ulate them to go to battle with their might, puttin
their trust in the Lord; therefore; we did. conten
with them, face to face.. And it came to pass that we
did drive them again out, of our land; and we slew
them:-with a great slaughter, even. so many that we
did not number them. ot
And it eame to pags that we returned again to.our own
land, and my people again-began to tend their flocks,
and to till their ground. And now, I being. old, did
confer the kingdom upon one of my sons; therefore, I 

say no more, And may the Lord bless my people..
Amen.
