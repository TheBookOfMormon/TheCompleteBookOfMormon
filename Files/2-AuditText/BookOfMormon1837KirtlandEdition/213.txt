and our-herds, into the wilderness; and we will travel
around the land of'Shilom. And it came to pass that
the king hearkened unto the words of Gideon.: And
king Limhi caused that his people should gather their
flocks together; and he sent the tribute of wine to the
Lamanites; and he also sent more wine, as a present
unto them: and they did drink freely of the wine which
king Limhi did send unto them.

And it came to pass that the people of king Limbi
did depart by night into the wilderness with their fiocks
end their herds, and they went round about the land
of Shilom in the wilderness, and bent their course to-
wards the land of Zarahemla, being led by Ammon
and his brethren. And they had taken all their gold,
and silver, and their precious things, which they could
carry; and also their provisions with them, into the
wilderness; and they pursued their journey. And af-
ter being many days in the wildesness, they arrived in
the land of Zarahemla, and joined his people, and be-
came his subjects. And it came to pass that Mosiah
received them with joy; and he also received their
records, and also the records which had been found by
the people of Limhi. . And now it came to pass when
the Lamanites had found that the people of Lim-
hi had departed out of the land by night, that they
sent an army into the wilderness to pursue them; and
after they had pursued them two days, they could no

longer follow their tracks; therefore they were lost in
the wilderness.
