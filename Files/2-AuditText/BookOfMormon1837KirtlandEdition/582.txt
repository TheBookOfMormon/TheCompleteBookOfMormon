was a murderer from the beginning.” And they were
kept up by the power of the devil to administer these
oaths unto the people,-to keep them in darkness, to
help such as sought power, to gain power, and to mur.
der, and’ to: plunder, and to lie, and to commit all
manner of wickedness and whoredoms. And it was
the daughter of Jared who'put it into his heart to
search up these things of old; and Jared put it- into
the heart of Akish: wherefore Akish administered .it
unto'his kindreds and triends, leading them away by
fair promises to do whatsoever thing he desired. And
it came to pass that they formed a'secret- combination,
even as they of old; which combination is most abom-
inable and wicked above all, in. the sight of God; for
the Lord worketh not in secret combinations, neither
doth he will that man should shed blood, but in all
things hath forbidden it, from-the beginning-of man:
And now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of their
oaths and combinations, for it hath been made known
unto me that they arehad among all people,'and they
are had among the Lamanites, and they have caused
the destruction of this people of whom! am now
rpeaking, and also the destruction of the people. of
ephi; and whatsoever nation shall uphold:such se.
eret combinations, to get power and gain; until they
shall spread over the nation, behold, they shall be des-
troyed, for the Lord will not suffer that'the blood of
his saints, whichshall/be shed by -thiem, shall always
ery unto him from the ground for vengeance upon
them, and: yet he avenge them not; wherefore, O ye
Gentiles; it is wisdom in God that these things should
be shewn unto you; that'thereby ye may repent of
your sins, and suffer: not that’ these murderous combi-
nations shall get above you, which arebuilt up to get
 power and gain, and the work, yea, even the work of
destruction come. upon you; yea, even the sword of
the’ justice of the eternal-God, shall fall upanyoa, to:
your overthrow and destruction, if ye shall suffer these
things to be; wherefore the Lord commandeth’ you,
when ye shall see these things come atnong you, that
ye shall awake to’a senseof your awful situation, be-
cause of this secret combination which shalt be among
you, or wo'be unto it, because of the blood of: them
who’have been slain;forthey eryfrom: the dust’ for
vengeance upon 'it, andialso upon those who build it:
