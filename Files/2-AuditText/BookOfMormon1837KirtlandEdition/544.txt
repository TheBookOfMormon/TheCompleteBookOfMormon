merous.than were the people of God, And they did
still continue to build up churches unto themselves,
and adorn them with all manner of precious things-.
And thus did two hundred and fifty years pass away,
and also two hundred and sixty years. And it came
to pass that the wicked part of the people began again
to build up the secret oaths and combinations of Gad-
dianton. And also the people who were called the
people of Nephi, began to be proud in their hearts, be-
cause of their exceeding riches, and become vain, like
unto their brethren, the Lamanites. And from this
time, the disciples began to sorrow for the sins of the
world.

And it came to pass that when three hundred years
had passed away, both. the people of Nephi and the
Lamanites had become exceeding wicked one like unto
another. And it came to pass that the robbers of Gad-
dianton did spread over all the face of the land; and
there were none that were righteous, save it were the
disciples of Jesus. And gold and silver did they lay
up in store in abundance, and did traffic in all manner
of traffic.

And it came to pass that after three hundred and
five years had passed away, (and the people did still
remain in wickedness, ) Amos died, and his brother Am-
maron, did keep the record in his stead. And it came
to pass that when three hundred and twenty years had
passed away, Ammaron, being constrained by the Ho-
ly Ghost, did hide up the records which were sacred;
yea, even all the sacred records wbich had been hand-
ed.down from generation to generation, which were
sacred, even until the three hundred and twentieth
year from the coming-of Christ. And he did hide
them up unto the Lord, that they might come again
unto the remnant of the house of Jacob, Senoeciiny to
the prophecies and the promises of the Lord. And
thus is the end of the record of Ammaron.
