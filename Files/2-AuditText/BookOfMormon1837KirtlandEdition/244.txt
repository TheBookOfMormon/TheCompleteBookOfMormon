selyes, succoring those who stood in need of their suc-
cor, such as imparting their substance to the poor and
the needy; feeding the hungry; and’suffering all man-
ner of afflictions, tor Christ's sake, who should come
according to the spirit of prophecy, looking forward to
that day, thus retaining a remission of their sins; be-
ing filled-with great joy, because of the resurrection of
the dead, according to the will, and power, and deliv-

And now it came to pass that Alma, having seen
the afflictions of the humble followers of God, and the
persecutions which were heaped upon them by the re-
mainder of his people, and seeing all their inequality,
began to be. very sorrowful; nevertneless the spirit of
the Lord did not fail him. And he selected a wise
man who was among the elders of the church, and
gave him power according to the voice of the people,
that he inight have power to enact laws according to
the laws which had been given, and to put them in
force, according to the wickedness and the crimes of
the people. Now this man’s name was Nephihah, and
he was appointed chief judge; and he sat in the judg-
ment seat, to judge and to govern the peopie. Now
Alma did not grant unto him the office of being high
priest over the chnrch, but he retained the office of
high priest unto himself; but he delivered the judg-
ment seat unto Nephihah: and this he did, that he
himself might go forth among his people, or among
the people of Nephi, that he might preach the word of
God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of
their duty, and that he might pull down, -by the word
of God, all the pride and craftiness, and all the con-
tentions which were among his people, seeing no way
that he might reclaim them, save it were in bearing
down in pure testimony against them. And thus in
the commencement of the ninth year of the reign of
the judges over the people of Nephi, Alma delivered
up the judgment seat to Nephihah, and confined him-
self wholly to the high priesthood of the holy order
of God, to the testimony of the word, according to the
spirit of revelation and prophecy.
