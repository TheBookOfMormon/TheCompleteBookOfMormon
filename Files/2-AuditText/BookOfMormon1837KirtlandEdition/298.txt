the Lamanites, of themselves, were sufficiently hard-
ened, but the Amalekites, and the Amulonites, were
still harder; therefore they did cause the Lamanites
that they should harden their hearts, that they should

And it-came to pass that Aaron came to the city of
Jerusalem, and firstly began to preach to the Amalek-
ites. And he began to preach to them in their syna-
