behold, I, know your thoughts, and ye have desired
the thing which John, my beloved, who was with me
in my ministry, before that I was lifted up by the
Jews, desired of me; therefore more blessed are ye,
for ye shall never taste of death, but ye shall live to
behold all the doings of the Father, unto the children
of men, even until all tbings shall be fulfilled, accord-
ing to the will of the Father, when I shall come in my
glory, with the powers of heaven; and ye shall never
endure the pains of death; but when J shall come in
my glory, ye shall be changed in the twinkling of an
eye, from mortality to immortality; and then shall ye
be blessed fh the: kingdom of my Father. And again,
ye shall not have pain while ye shall dwell in the flesh,
neither sorrow, save it be for the sins of the world;
and all this will 1 do because of the thing which ye
have desired of me, for-ye have desired that ye might
bring the souls of men unto me, while the world shall

and ye shall sit down’ in the kingdom of my Father;

given me fulness of joy; and ye shall be even as I am,
and I am even as the Father; and the Father and I are
one; and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father
and me; and the Father giveth the Holy Ghost unto
the children of men, because of me.

saw and heard unspeakable things. And it was for-
bidden them that they should uttter; neither was it
given unto them power that they could utter the
things which they saw and heard; and whether they
were in the body or out of the body, they could not
tell; for it did seem unto them like a transfiguration -
of them, that they were changed from this body of
flesh, into au immortal state, that they could behold
the things of God. But’it came to pass that they did:
again minister upon’ the face of the earth; neverthe-
less they did not minister of the things which’ they
had heard and: seen, because of the commandment
which was given them-in heaven, And now whether
they were mortal or immortal, from the day of their
