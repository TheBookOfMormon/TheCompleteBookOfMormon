lives because of their great desires which they had for
the welfare of this people; yea, and this they have
done, when they were about to perish with hunger,
because of your exceeding great neglect towards them,
And now, my beloved brethren; for ye had ought to
be beloved: yea, and ye had ought to have stirred
yourselves more diligently for the welfare and the
freedom of this people; but behold, ye have neglected
them, insomuch that the blood of thousands shall
come upon your heads for vengeance; yea, for known
unto Goi were all their cries, and all their sufferings.
Behold, could ye suppose that ye could sit upon your
thrones, andâ€™ because of the exceeding goodness of

caused so much. bloodshed among ourselves; yea, at
the time we were contending among ourselves, if we
had united our strength, as.we hitherto have done;
yea, had it not been for the desire of power and, au-
thority which those king-men had over us; had they
been true to the cause of our freedom, and united with
us, and gone forth against our enemies, instead of tek-
ing up their swords against us, which. was the. cause
of so much :bloodshed. among ourselves; yea, if we
