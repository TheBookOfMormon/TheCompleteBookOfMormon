they were near to be cast into the watery grave. And
Jacob and Joseph also, being young,â€™ having need of
much nourishment, were grieved because of the afflic-
tions of their mother; and also my. wife, with her tears
and prayers, and also my children, did not soften the
hearts of my brethren, that they would loose me;
and there was nothing, save it were the power of God,
which threatened them with destruction, could soften
their hearts; wherefore, when they saw that they
were about to be swallowed up in the depths of the
sea, they repented of'thething which they had done,
