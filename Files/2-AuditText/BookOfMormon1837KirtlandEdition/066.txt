that they know good from evil. And the law is given
unto men. And by the law, no flesh is justified; or,
by the law, men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal
law, they were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law
they perish from that which is good, and become mis-
erable forever. Wherefore, redemption cometh in and
through the holy Messiah: for he is full of grace and
truth. Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin,
to answer the ends of the law, untoall those who have
a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none
else can the ends of the law be answered. Wherefore,
how great the importance to make these things known
unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know
that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of
God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and
grace of the holy Messiah, who layeth down his life
according to the flesh, and taketh itagain by the pow-

things. If not so; my first born in the wilderness,â€™
righteousness could not be brought -to pass; neither
wickedness; neither holiness nor misery; neither good
nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a com-
pound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body, it
must needs remain as dead, having no life, neither
death nor corruption, nor ineorruption, happiness nor
misery, neither sense nor insensibility. Wherefore,

it must needs have been created for a thing of nought;

wherefore, there would have been no purpose in the
end of its creation. Wherefore, this thing must needs
destroy the wisdom of-God,'and his eternal purposes;

and also, the power, and the mercy, and the justice of
God. And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall al-
