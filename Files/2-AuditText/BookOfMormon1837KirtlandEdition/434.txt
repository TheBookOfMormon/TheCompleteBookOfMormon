begatl to cover the face of the wliole earth, from the

sea south, to the seanorth, from the sea west, tothe:
sea east. And the people who were in the land north-

ward, did dwell in tents, and in houses of cement, and

they did suffer wliatsoever tree should’spring up upon

time they inight have timber to build their houses, yea,
