CHAPTER XXI.

The account of the people of Nephi, and their wars and
dissensions, in the duys of Helaman, according. to the
record of Helaman, which he kept in his days.

Brworp, now it came. to pass that the people of Ne-
phi were exceedingly rejoiced, because. the Lord had
again delivered them out of the hands of their enemies;
therefore they gave thanks unto the Lord their God;
yea, and they did fast much and pray much, and they
did worship God with exceeding great joy.

And it came to pass in the nineteenth year of the

even the fourth generation shall not all pass away,
before this great miquity shall come; and when that
great day cometh, behold, the time very soon cometh
