whatsoever did belong unto them. And it came to
pass that they had not eaten up all their provisions;
therefore they did take with them all that they had
not devoured, of all their grain of every kind, and their
gold, and their silver, and all their precious things, and
they did return to their own lands and their posses-
sions, bothi on the north and on the south, both on the
land northward and on the land southward. And they
granted unto those robbers who had entered into a
covenant to keep the peace, of the band who were de-
sirous to remain Lamanites, lands, according to their
numbers, that they might have, with their labors;
wherewith tosubsist upon; and thus they did establish
peace in all the land. And they began again to pros-
perand to wax great; and the twenty and sixth and
seventh years passed away, and there was great order
in the land; and they had formed their laws according
to sey and justice. And now there was nothing in
all the land, to hinder the people from prospering con-

And now it’ was Gidgiddoni, and the judge Lachone-
us, and those who had been appointed leaders, who
had established this great peace in the land. a

built anew, and there were many old cities repaired;
and there were many highways cast up; and many
rads made, which led from city to city, and from land
toland, and from place to place. And thus passed
away the twenty and eighth year, and the people had
continual peace. But it came to pass in the twenty
and ninth year, there began to be some disputings
atnong the people; and some were lifted up unto pride
and boastings, because of their exceeding great riches,
yea, even unto great persecutions: for there were ma~
ty merchants in the land, and’also many lawyers, and
many officers. And the people began to be distin-
fulshed by ranks, acording to their riches, and their
chances for learning; yea, some were ignorant because
of their poverty, and others did receive great learning
because of their riches; some were lifted up in” pride,
and others were exceeding humble; some did’ return
tailing for railing, while others would receive railing,
ahd persecation, and all’ianner of afflictions, and
