roots also. unto mine own self, that when they shall
be sufficiently strong, perhaps they may bring forth
good fruit unto me, and I may yet have glory.in the
fruit of my. vineyard.

And it came to pass that they took from the natural
tree which had become wild, and grafted in unto the
natural trees, which also had become wild; and they
also took of the natural trees which had become wild,
and grafted inte their mother tree. And the Lord of
the vineyard said unto the servant, pluck not the
wild branches from the trees, save it be those which
are most. bitter; and in them yeâ€™shall graft, according
to that. which 1 have said. And we will nourish
again the trees of the vineyard, and we will trim up
the branches thereof; and we will pluck from the trees

last, and dig about the trees, both old and young, the
Srst and the last, and the last and. the first, that all
may be nourished once again for the last time..
Wherefore, dig. about them, and prune. them, and
dung them once more, for the last. time: for the.end
draweth nigh. And if itso be that. these. last.grafts
shall grow, and brig: forth. the natural fruit, then
