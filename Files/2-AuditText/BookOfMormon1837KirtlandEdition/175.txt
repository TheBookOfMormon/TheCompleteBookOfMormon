king has spoken unto us, and hag brought us to this
great knowledge, whereby we do rejoice with such
exceeding great joy: and we are willing to enter into
a covenant with our God, to do his will, and to be
obedient to his commandments in all things that he
shall command us, all the remainder of our days, that
we may not bring upon ourselves a never ending tor-
