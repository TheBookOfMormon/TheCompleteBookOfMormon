to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate
heritages: that thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go
forth; to them that sit in darkness, Shew yourselves.
They shall feed in the ways, and their pasturesâ€™ shall
be in all high places. They shall not hunger nor
thirst, neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them:
for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even
by the springs of water shall he guide them. And I
will make all my mountains away, and my highways
shall be exalted. And then, O house of Israel, behold,
these shall come from far; and lo, these from the north
and from the west; and these from the land of Sin-

is too straight for me: give place to me that I may dwell.
Then shait thou say in thine heart, who liath begotten
