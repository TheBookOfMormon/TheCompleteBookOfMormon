CHAPTER VII.

Axp now I, Moroni, write a few of the words of
my father Mormon, which he spake concerning faith,
hope and charity; for after this manner did he speak
unto the people, as he taught them in the synagogue
which they had built for the place of worship. And
now, I, Mormon, speak unto you, my -beloved breth-:

not do that which is good; neither will he gre a good
gift. For behold, a bitter fountain cannot. bring forth
good water; neither can a good fountain bring forth
