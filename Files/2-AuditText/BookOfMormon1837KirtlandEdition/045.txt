brethren’'saw that I was about to’ build a ship, they
began to murmur against me, saying, our brother isa.
fool, forhe thinketh that he ean build a ship: yea, and
he also'thinketh that he’can cross these great: waters.
And thus my brethren did complain against me, and
were desirous that they might not labor, for they did
not believe that I could build a ship; neither would
they believe that I was instructed of theLord.

And now it came to pass that I, Nephi, was exceed-
ing sorrowful, because of the hardness of their hearts;
and now when they saw that [ began to be sorrowful,
they were glad in their hearts, insomuch that they dia
rejoice over me, saying, we knew that ye could not
construct a ship, for we knew that ye were lacking in
judgement; wherefore, thou canst not accomphsh so
great a work; and thou art lke unto our father, led
away by the foolish imaginations of his heart; yea, he
hath led us out of the land of Jerusalem; and we have
wandered in the wilderness for these many years; and
our women have toiled, being big with child; and
they have borne children in the wilderness, and suffered
all things, save it were death; and it would have been
better that they had died, before they came out of Je-
rusalem, than to have suffered these afflictions. Be-

erness, which time we might have enjoyed our posses-
sions, and the land of our inheritance: yea, and we
might have been happy;.and we know that the peo-
ple who were inthe land of Jerusalem, were a right-
eous people; for they kept the statutes and the judge-
ments of the Lord, and all his commandments, accord-
ing to the law of Moses; wherefore, we know that they
are a righteous people; and our father hath judged
them, and hath led us away because we would heark-
en unto his words; yea, and our brother is like unto
him. And after this manner of language did my breth-
ren murmur and complain against us.

And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake unto them,
saying, do ye believe that our fathers, who were the
children of Israel, would have been led away out of
the hands of the Egyptians, if they had not hearkened
unto the words of the Lord? Yea, do ye suppose that
they would have been led out of bondage, if the Lord
had not commanded Moses that he should lead them
out of bondaget Now ye now that the children of Is-
rael were ih bondage; and ye know that they were
laden With tasks, which were grievous to be borne;
