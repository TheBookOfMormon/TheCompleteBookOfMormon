that the power of God came down upon: them, and
they were overcome, that they fell to the earth. Now,
this thing was pleasing unto me, Jacob; for 1 had re.
quested it of my Father who was in~heaven: for he
had heard-my ery, and arswered my prayer:

And it came to pass that peace and the love of God,
was restored again among the pecpte;. and they
searched the scriptures, and hearkened no mors? to the
words of this wicked man. And it came to pass that
many means were devised, to reclaim and restore the
Lamanites, to the knowledge of the truth; but it-all
were vain: for they delighted in wars and bloodsheds;
and they had an eternal hatred against us, their breth
ren. And they sought by the power of their arms to
destroy us continually; wherefore, the people of Ne-
phi cid fortify against them with their armies, and
with all their might, trusting in the God and rock of
their salvation; wherefore, they became as yet, con-
querors of their enemics.

And it came to pass that I, Jacob, began to be old;
and the reeord of this people being kept on the other
plates of Nephi, wherefore,  conclude this record, de-
claring that I have written according to the best of
my knowledge, by saying, that the time passed away
w.th us, and also our lives passed away, like -ag.it
were unto usa dream, we being a lonesome and a
solemn people, wanderers, east out from Jerusalem;
born in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our
brethren, which caused wars and contentions; where-
fore, we did mourn out our days.

And I, Jacob, saw that I must soon go down to my
grave; wherefore, J said unto my son Enos, take these
pate And I told him the things which my brother
Nephi had commanded me; and he promised obedi-
ence unto the commands. And [ make an end of my
writing upon these plates, which writing has been
small; and to the reader I bid farewell, hoping that
nny of my brethren: may read-my words. LDrethren,
adieu. s
