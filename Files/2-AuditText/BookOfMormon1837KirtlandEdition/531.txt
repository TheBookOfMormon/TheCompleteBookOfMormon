And now it came to pass that'when Jesus hadtold
these things, he expounded them unto the’ multitude;
and he did expound all things: unto them; both great
and:small, And he saith, these scriptures which ye
had not with you, the Father commanded that I should
give unto you, for it was wisdom in him that they
should be aie unto future generations... And he did
expound all things, even from the beginning until the
time that he should come in his glory; yea, even all
things which should come upon the face of the earth,
even until the elements should melt with fervent heat,
and the earth should be wrapt together asa scroll, and
the heavens and the earth should pass away; and.even
unto the great and last day, when all people, and all
kindreds, and all nations and tongues shail stand be-
fore God, to be judged of their works, whether they be
good or whether they be evil; if they be goon, to the
resurrection of everlasting life; and if they be evil, to
the resurrection of damnation, being on a narallel, the
one'on the one hand, and the other on the other hand
according tothe mercy, and the justice, and the holi-
ness which is in Christ, who was. before the world

began.
