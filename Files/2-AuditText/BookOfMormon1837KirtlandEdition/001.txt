THE

BOOK OF MORMON:

AN ACCOUNT WRITTEN BY THE HAND OF MOR-
MON, UPON PLATES TAKEN FROM
THE PLATES OF NEPHI.

Wherefore itis an abridgment of the record of the people of
Nephi, and also of the Lamanites; written to the Lamanites,
who are a remnant of the house of Israel; and also to Jew
and Gentile: written by way of commandme ni, and also by
the spirit of prophecy and of revelation, Written, and seal-
ed up, and hid up unto the Lorn, that they might not be de-
stroyed; to come forth by the gift and power of Gop unto the
interpretation thereof: sealed by the hand of Moroni, and
hid up unto the Lorp, to come forth in due time by the way
of Gentile; the interpretation thereof by the gift of Gon:

An abridgment taken from the book of Ether: also, which isa
record of the people of Jared; who were seattered at the time
the Lorn confounded the language of the people when they -
were building a tower to got toheav en: which is to shew un-
to the remnant of the house of Israel what greatthings the .
Loxp hath done for thelr fathers; und that they may know the
covenants of the Lorn, that they are not cast off forever; and
alsoto the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is
the Crist, the Erernat Gop, manifesting himself unto all
nations. And now if there are faults, ber are the mistakes
of men; wherefore condemn not the things of Gon, that ye
may be found spotless at the judgment seat of CugistT.
