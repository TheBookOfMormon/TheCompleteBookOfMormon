and came over in the land of Zarahemla, and joined
the people of Ammon; end the army which pursued
after them, returned, having pursued afler them in
vain: and thus Amalickiah, by his fraud, gained the
hearts of the people:

And it came to pass on the morrow, he entered the
city Nephi, with his armies, and took possession of the
city. And now it came to pass that the queen, when
she had heard that the king was slain: for Amalickiah
had sent an embassy to the queen, informing her that
the king had been slain by his servants; that he had
pursued them with his army, but it was in vain, and
they had made their escape, therefore when the queen
had received this message, she sent unto Amalickiah,
desiring him that he would spare the people of the
city; and she aiso desired him that he should come in
unto her; and she also desired him that he should
bring witnesses with him, to testify concerning the
death of the king.

And it came to pass that Amalickiah took the same
servant that slew the king, and all they who were with
him, and went in unto the queen, unto the place where
she sat; and they'all testified unto her that the king
was slain by his own servants; and they said, also,
they have fled; does not this testify against them?
And thus they satisfied the queen concerning the death
of the king,

And it came to pass that Amalickiah sought the
favor of the queen, and took her unto him to wife; and
thus by his fraud, and by the assistance of his cunning
servants, he obtained the kingdom: yea, he was ac-
knowledged king throughout all the land, among all
the people of the Lamanites, who were composed of
the Lamanites, and the Lemiuelites, and the -]shmael-
ites, and all the dissenters of the Nephites, from the
reign of Nephi down to the present time. Now these
dissenters, having the same instruction and the same
information of the Neephites; yea, having been instruet-
ed in the sathe knowledge of the Lord; nevertheless;
it is strange to relate, not long after their dissen-
sions, they became more hardened and impenitent, and
more wild, wicked and ferocious, thas the Lamanites;
drinking in with the traditions of the Lamanites; giv-
ing way to indolence, and all manner of lascivious-
hess; yeas entirely forgetting the Lord their God. Â©
