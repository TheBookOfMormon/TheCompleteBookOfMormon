men, for. they. were. great warriors: for.every man.of
Teancum did-exceed the Lamanites in their strength,
and in.their skill of war, insomuch that they did gain
advantage over the Lamanites. ces

And it came to pass that'they did harrass them, in-
somuch that they did slay themeven until it was dark,
And it came to pass that Teancum and his men did
pitch their tents in the borders of the land Bountifal;
and Amalickiah did pitch his tents in the borders on
the beach by the seashore, and after this manner were
they driven. /

And it came to pass that when the night had come,
Teancum and his servant stole forth and went out by
night, and went into the camp of Amalickiah; and be-
hold, sleep had overpowered them, because of their
much fatigue, which was caused by the laborsand heat
of the day,

And it came to pass that Teancum stole privily into
the tent of the king, and puta javelin to his heart;
and he did cause the death of the king immediately,
that he did net awake his servants. And he returned
again. privilyâ€™to his own camp, and behold, his men
were asleep; and he awoke them, and told them.all
the. things that he had done. And he caused that his
armies .should stand in readiness, lest the Lamanites
had awoke, and should come upon them. And thus
ended the twenty and fifth year of: the reign of the
judges over the people.of Nephi; and thus ended the
days of Amalickiah. '

morning of the first month, behold, they found Ama-
lickiah was dead in his own tent; and they also saw
that. Teancum was ready to give them battle on. that
day. And now when'the Lamanites saw this, they
Were affrighted; and they abandoned their design in
marching into the land:northward, and retreated with
all their army into the city, of Mulek, and sought pro-
tection in their fortifications. And.it came to pass
