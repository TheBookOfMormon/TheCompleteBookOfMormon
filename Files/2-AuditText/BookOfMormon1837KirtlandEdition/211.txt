filled with exceeding great joy. _Now king Limhi had
sent,-previous to the coming of Ammon,.a small num-
ber of nen to search for the land of Zarahemla; but
they could not find it; and they were lost in the wilder-
ness. Nevertheless they did find a land which had
been peopled; yea, a land which was covered with dry
bones; yea, a land which had been peopled, and which
had been destroyed; and they having supposed it to be
the land of Zarahemla, returned to the land of Nephi,
having arrived in the borders of the land not many
days before the coming of Ammon. And they brought
a record. with them, even a record of the people whose

king Limhi had also entered into a covenant with God,
and also many of his people; to serve him, and keep
his commandments.  ,

 And it came to pass that king Limhi-and many-of
his people were:-desirous to be baptized; but there was
none inthe land that had-authority from God. And
Ammon declined doing this thing, considering himself
an unworthy servant; therefore they did not. at; that
time form themselves into a church, waiting upon the
spirit of the: Lord) Now:they were desirous to become
evenvas Alma andvhis. brethren; who had fled into the
wilderness. They were desirous te be baptized; as a
