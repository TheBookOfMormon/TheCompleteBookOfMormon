they. had slain the army of Jared, they were about to
slay, him. also; and he plead with them that they
would not slay him, and he would give up the king-
dom unto his father. And it came to pass that they
did grant unto him his life. And now Jared became
exceeding sorrowful because of the loss of the king-
dom, for he had set his heart upon the kingdom, and

Jared being exceeding expert, and seeing the sorrows
