descendant of Joseph, wherefore he and his fathers had
kept the records. .

And now when my father saw all these things, he
was filled with the spirit, and began to prophesy con-
cerning his seed; that these plates of brass should go
forth unto all nations, kindreds, tongues and people
who were of his seed. Wherefore he said that these
plates of brass should never perish; neither should they
be dimmed any more by time. And he prophesied
many things concerning his seed.

And it came to pass that thus far I and my father
had kept the commandments wherewith the Lord had
commanded us. And we had obtained the record
which the Lord had commanded us, and searched them
and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great
worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the
commandments of the Lord unto our children. Where-
foreit was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry
them with us, as we journied in the wilderness to-
wards the land of promise.

CHAPTER II.

Anp now I, Nephi, do not give the genealogy of my
fathers in this part of my record; neither at any time
shall I give it after upon these plates which I am wri-
ting; for it is given in the record which has been kept
by iy father; wherefore  donot write it in this work.
For it sufficeth me to say, that we are a descendant of
Joseph. And it mattereth not to me that I am par-
ticular to give a full account of all the things of my
father, for they cannot be written upon these plates,
for [ desire the room that I may write of the things of
God. For the fullness of mine intent is that  may
persuade men to come unto the God of Abraham, and
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and be saved.
Wherefore the things which are pleasing unto the
world, I do not write, but the things which are pleas-
ing unto God and unto those who are not of the world.
Wherefore I shall give commandment unto my seed,
that they shall not occupy these plates with things
which are not of worth unto the children of men.
