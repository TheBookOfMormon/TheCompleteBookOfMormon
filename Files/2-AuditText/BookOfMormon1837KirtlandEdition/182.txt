for he has wherewith that he can look, and translate
all records that are of ancient date: and itis a gift
from God. And the things are called interpreters;
and no man can look in them, except he be command.
ed, lest he should look for that he ought not, and he
should perish. And whosoever is commanded to look
in them, the same is called seer. And behold, the
king of the people who is in the Jand of Zarahemla, is
the man that is commanded to do these things, and
who has this high gift from God. And the king said,
that a seer is greater than a prophet. And Ammon
said, that aseer is a revelator, and a prophet also;
and a gift which is greater, can no man have, except
he should possess the power of God, which no man
can; yet a man may have great power given him from
God. But a seer can know of things which have past,
and also of things which are to'come; and by them
shall all things be revealed, or rather, shall secret
things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come
to light, and things which are not known, shall be
made known by them; and also, things shall be made
known by them, which otherwise could not be known.
Thus God has provided a means that man, through
faith, might work mighty miracles: therefore, he be-
cometh a great benefit to his fellow beings.

And now, when Ammon had made an end of speak-
ing these words, the king rejoiced exceedingly, and
gave thands to God, saying, doubtless, a great myste-
ry is contained within these plates; and these interpret-
ers were doubtless prepared for the purpose of unfold-
ing all such mysteries to the children of men, O how
marvelous are the works of the Lord, and how long
doth he suffer with his people; yea, and how blind
and impenetrable are the understandings of the child-
ren of men: for they will not seck wisdom, neither do
they desire that sheshould rule over them. Yea, they
are as a wild flock, which fleeth from the shepherd,
and scattereth, and are driven, and are devoured by
the beasts of the forest.
