state, and ever would be, save they should rely on this
Redeemer.

And he spake also, concerning a prophet, who should
come before the Messiah, to prepare the way of the
Lord; yea, even he should go forth and cry in the wil-
derness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his
paths straight; for there standeth one among you
whom ye know not; and he is mightier than I, whose
shoeâ€™s latchet I am not worthy to unloose. And much
spake my father concerning this thing.

And my father said he should baptise in Bethabary,
beyond Jordan; and he also said he should baptise with
water; even that he should baptise the Messiah with
water. And after he had baptised the Messiah with
water, he should behold and bear record, that he had

or, in fine, after the Gentiles had received the fulness
of the gospel, the natural branches of the olive tree,
or the remnants of the house of Israel, should be graft-
ed in, or come to the knowledge of the true Messiah,
their Lord and their Redeemer. And after this man-
ner of language did my father prophesy and speak un-
to my brethren; and also many more things, which I
do not write in this book; for I have written as many
of them as were expedient for me in mine other book.
And all these things of which I have spoken, were
