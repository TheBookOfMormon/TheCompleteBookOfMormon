ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper
in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep my
commandments, ye shall be cut off from my presence.
But behold, my sons and my daughters,  cannot go
down to my grave, save I should leave a blessing up-
on you: For behold, I know that if ye are brought
up in the way ye should go, ye will not depart from
it. Wherefore, if ye are cursed, behold, I leave my
blessing upon you, that the cursing may be taken
from you, and be answered upon the heads of your

arents. Wherefere, because of my blessing, the
