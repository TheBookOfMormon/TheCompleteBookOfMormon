pedient in me. And he hath said, repent.all ye ends
of the earth, and:come unto me and be baptized:in
my name, and'have faith in me, that ye may be saved,
And now my beloved bretliren, if this:be the.case
that: these things are true which I have spoken unto
you, and God will shew unto you with power and
great glory at:the Jast day, that they are true; andif
they are true, has the day of miracles ceased? or have
angels ceased to appear unto the children of men?.
or has he withheld the power of the Holy Ghost from
them? or will he, so -long.as time shail last, or the
earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the
face thereof to be saved?) Behold I say unto you:nay;
for it-is by faith that miracles are wrought; and.it 18

there cannot be any hope. And again, behold I say un-
to you, that he cannot have faith and hope; save:he
shall be meek, and lowly of heart; ifso, his faith and
hope is'vain, for:none is acceptable before God, save
the'meek> and-lowly of heart; and if a man be meek
and lowly in heart, and confesses by: the power of the
Holy Ghost; that Jesus:is tle.Christ, he must: needs
have-charity; for if hehave not charity, he is nothing;
wherefore he must needs have charity... And:charity
suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, andis not
