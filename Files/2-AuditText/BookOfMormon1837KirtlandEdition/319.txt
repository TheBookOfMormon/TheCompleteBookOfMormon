repentance, and the’ plan of redemption, that they
should repent and come unto’ our God, that there
might not’ be more sorrow upon’ all the face of the
earth. But behold, I'am a nian, and do sin in my:
wish; for I ought to be content with the things which
the Lord hath allotted unto me. I ought not to har-
row up in my desires, the firm decree of a just God,
for I know that he granteth unto men according to
their desire, whether it be unto death or unto life;
yea, I know that he allotteth unto men, according to
their wills; whether they be unto salvation or unto
eestruction; yea, and I know that good and evil have
come before all men; or he that knoweth not good from
evil is blameless; but he that knoweth good and evil,’
to him it is given according to his desires; whether he
desireth good or evil, life or death, joy or remorse of
conscience. Now seeing that I know these things,
why should I desire more than to perform the work to
which I have been ealled? Why should I desire that
I was an angel, that I could speak unto all the ends of
the earth?. For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all
nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his
word; yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that the
should have; therefore we see that the Lord do
counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just
and true. I know that. which the Lord hath.com-
manded me, and I glory in it: I do not glory of my-
self, but { glory in that which the Lord hath: com-
manded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I
may be an instrument in the hands of God, to bring
some soul to repentance; and this ismyjoy. And be-
hold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent,
and coming to the Lord their God, then is my soul
filled with joy; then do I remember what the Lord: has
done for me; yea, even that he hath heard-my prayer;
yea; then do I remember his merciful arm which he
extended towards me; yea, and I also remember the’
captivity of my fathers; for I surely do know that the: -
Lord did deliver them out of bondage, and by this did”
establish his church; yea, the Lord God, the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac;and the God of Jacob, did:
deliver them out of bondage; yea, I have always re~
membered the captivity of my fathers: and that same
God who delivered them out of the hands of the Epyp-'
tians, did deliver them out’of bondage; yea, and at
same God did establish his’ church’: among’ them; yea,
and that same God hath called me by a holy-calling,
