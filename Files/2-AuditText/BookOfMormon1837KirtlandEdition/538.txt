ous works of Christ, ye'would, according'to the words
of Christ, know that these, things must surely come:
And wo be unto him that:will not hearken unto the
words of Jesus, and-also to them whom he hath cho-
sen and sent among them, for whoso receiveth not the
words of Jesus; and the words of those whom he hath
sent, receiveth'not him; and'therefore he will not fe.
ceive them at the last day; and it would be better for
them if they had not been born.  For.do ye suppose
that ye can get rid of the justice of an offended God,
who hath been trampled under feet of men, that there.
by salvation might come? And row behold, as I spake
concerning those whom the Lord had chosen, yea,
even three who were caught up into the heavens, that
I knew not whether they were cleansed from mortali-
ty to immortality. But behold, since I wrote, I have
inquired of the Lord, and he hath made it manifest un-
to me, that there must needs be a change wrought up-
on their bodies, or else itneeds be that they must taste
ofdeath; therefore that they might not taste of death,
there was a change wrought upon their bodies, that
they mght not suffer pain nor sorrow, save it were for
: theâ€™sins of the world, Now this change was not equal
to'that which should take place at the lost day; but
there wasa change wrought upon them, insomuch
that satan could have no power over them, that he
could not tempt them, and they were sanctified in the
flesh, that they were holy, and that the powers of the
earth could not hold them; and in this state they were
to remain until the judgment day of Christ; and at
that day they were to receive a greater change, and to
be received into. the. kingdom of the Father to go no
more out; but to-dwell with God eternally in the heay-
ens. And now behold, I say unto you, that when the
Lord shall see fit, in his wisdom, that these sayings
shall come unto the Gentiles, according to his word,
then ye may know that the covenant which the Fa-
ther hath made with the children of Israel, concerning
their restoration tothe lands of their inheritance, is
already beginning to be fulfilled; and ye may know
that the words of the Lord, which have been spoken
by the holy prophets, shall all be fulfilled; and ye need
not say that the Lord delays his coming unto the chil-
dren of Israel; and ye need not imagine in your hearts
that the words which have been spoken: are vain, for
behold, the Lord willremember his:covenant which he
hath made unto his peopleof the house of Israel. Avd
