walk guiltless before God, I would that ye should im-
part of your substance to the poor, every man accord:
ing to that which he hath,such as feedig the hung-
ry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick, and adminis-
tering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally,
according to their wants, and see that all these things
are done in wisdo:n and order: for it is not requisite
that a man should run faster than he has strength..
And again: It is expedient that he should be diligent,
that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all
things must be done in order. And: I would that ye
should remember, that whosoever among you that
borroweth of his neighbor, should return the thing
that he borroweth, according as he doth agree, or else
thou shalt commit sin, and perhaps thou shalt cause
thy neighbor to commit sin also. And finally, I can.
not tell you all the things whereby ye may commit
sin: for there are divers ways and means, even’so ma-
ny, that I cannot number them. But this much I can
tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your
thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and ob-
serve the commandments of God, and continue in the
faith ofwhat ye have heard concerning the coming of
our Lomi, even unto the end of your lives, ye must
perish, nd now, O man, remember, and perish not.

CHAPTER HL

Anp now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin
had thus spoken to his people, he sent among them,
desiring to know of his people, if they believed the
words which he had spoken unto them. And they all
cried with one voice, saying, Yea, we believe all the
words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we
know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit
of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty
change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more
disposition to do evil, but todo good continually..
And we, ourselves, also, through the infinite goodness:
of God, and the manifestations of his Spirit, have
great views of that which is to come; and were it ex-
pedient, we could’ prophesy of all things. And itis
the faith which we hays had on the things which our
