he has laid to cateh this people, that he might bring
you into sabjection unto him, that he might encirele
you about with his chains, that he might chain yor

er of bis captivity. ae

Now when Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom
began to tremble more exceedingly, for he was con-
vinced more and more of the power of God; and he
was also convinced that Alma and Amulek hada
knowledge of him, for he was convinced that they
knew the thoughts and intents of his heart: for power
was given unto them that they might, know of these
things, according to the spirit of prophecy. And
Zeezrom beganto inquire of them diligently, that’ he
might’ know more concerning the kingdom of God..
And he said unto Alma, what does this mean which
Amulek hath spoken concerning the resurrection of the
dead, that all shall rise from the dead, both the just and
the-wnjust, and are brought to stand before God, to be
judged according to their works? And now Alma be-

they shall not impart only according to the portion of
his word, which he doth grant unto the children of
men; according to’ the heed and diligence which they

given unto him to know the mysteries of God, until
they know them in full; and they that will harden
their hearts, to them is given the lesser portion of the
word, until they know nothing concerning his myste-

and Jed by his will down to destruction. Now this is
what is meant by the chains of hell; and Amulek hath
spoken plainly concerning death, and being raised
from this mortality to a state of immortality, and: be-
ing brought before the bar of God, to be judged ac-
cording to our works. Then if our hearts have been
hardened, yea, if we have hardened our hearts against
the word, insomuch that it has not been found in ua,
then will our state be awful, for then we shall be'con-
demned: for our words will condemn us, yea, all our
works will condemn us; we shall net be found spot-
leas; and our thoughts will also condemn us; and in
