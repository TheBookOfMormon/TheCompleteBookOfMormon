CHAPTER Il.

Anp-now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin
had made an end of speaking the words which had
been delivered unto him by the angel of the Lord, that
he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and
behold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear of the
Lord had come upon them; and they had viewed
themselves in their own carnal state, even less than
the dust of the earth, And they all cried aloud with
one voice, saying, O have mercy, and apply the aton-

his trust in the Lord, and should be diligent in keep-
