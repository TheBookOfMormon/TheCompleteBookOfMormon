and all the wars, and contentions, and bloodshed, and
the stealing, and the plundering, and the committing
of whoredoms, and all manner of iniquities, which
cannot be enumerated; telling them that these things
ought not to be; that they were expressly repugnant
to the commandments of God.

And now it came to pass, after king Mosiah had
sent these things forth among the people, they were
convinced of the truth of his words; therefore they
relinquished their desires for a king, and became ex-
ceedingly anxious that every man should have an
equal chance throughout all the land; yea, and every
man expressed a willingness to answer for his own
sins. Therefore it came to pass that they assembled
themselves together in bodies throughout the land, to
cast in their voices concerning who should be their
judges, to judge them according to the law which had

en given them; and they were exceedingly rejoiced,
because of the liberty which had been granted unto
them. And they did wax strong in love towards Mo-
siah; yea, they did esteem him more than any other
man: for they did not look upon him as a tyrant, who
was seeking for gain, yea, for that lucre which: doth cor-
rupt the soul, for he had not exacted riches of them,
neither had he delighted in the shedding of blood; but
he had established peace in the land, and he had grant-
ed unto his people that they should be delivered from
all manner of bondage; therefore they did esteem him,
yea, exceedingly, beyond measure. And it came to
pass that they did appoint judges to rule over them,
or to judge them according to the law; and this they
did throughout all the land.

And it came to pass that Alma was appointed to be
the first chief judge; he being also the high priest; his
father having conferred the office upon him, and had
given him the charge concerning all the affairs of the
church. And now it came to pass that Alma did
walk in the ways of the Lord, and he did keep his
commandments, and he did judge righteons judg-
ments; and there was continual peace through the
land; and thus commenced the reign of the judges
throughout all the land of Zarahemla, among all the
people who were called the Nephites: and Alma was
the first and chief judge. And now it came toâ€™ pass
that his father ied: being eighty and two years: old,
having lived to fulfil the commandments of God.
