unto them, for they were praying unto the Father, in
his name; and Jesus came and stood in the midst of
them, and saith unto them, what will ye that I shall
give unto you; and they said unto him, Lord, we
will that thou wouldst tell us the name whereby we
shall call this church; for there are disputations amon
the people concerning this matter. And the Lo
said unto them, verily, verily I say unto you, why is
it that the people should murmur and dispute because
of this thing? have they not read the scriptures, which
say ye must take upon you the name of Christ, which
is my mame? for by this name shall ye be called at'the
last day; and whoso taketh upon him my name, and
endureth to the end, the same shall be saved at the
last day; therefore, whatsoever ye shall do, ye shall
do it in my name; therefore ye shall call the church in
my name; and ye shall call upon the Father. in my
name, that he will bless the church for my sake; and
how be it my church, save it be called in my name
for if a church be called in Moses’ name, then it be
Moses’ church: or if it be called in the name of a man,
thenit be the church of a man; but if it be called in my
name, then it is my church, if it so be that they are
built upon my gospel. Verily I say unto you, that ye
are built upon my gospel; therefore ye shall eall what-
soever things ye do call in my name; theretore if ye
eall upon the Father, for the church, if it be in my
name, the Father will hear you; and if it so be that
the church'is built upon my gospel, then will the Fa-
ther shew forth his own works in it; but if it be not
built upon my gospel, and is built upon the works of
men, or upon the works of the devil, verily I say unto
you, they have joy in their works for a season, and by
and by the end cometh, and they are hewn down and
cast into the fire, from whence there is no return; for
their works do follow them, for it is because of’ their
works that they are hewn down; therefore remember
the things:that I have told you. Behold I have given
unto you my gospel, and this is the pel which I
have given unto you, that I came into the world to do
the will of:my Father, because my Father sent mej
and my Father'sent me that I might be lifted up upon
the cross; and:after that } had been lifted up upon the
eross; I mightdraw all men unto me; that as I have
been lifted up by-men;eyen so should men be lifted u
by the Father, to’stand before me, to be judged ot the
 Works, whether they be good or whether they be evil;
