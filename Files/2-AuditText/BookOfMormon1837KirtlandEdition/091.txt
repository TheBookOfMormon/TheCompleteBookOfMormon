The word that Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw, con-
cerning Judah and Jerusalem: And it shall come to
pass in the last days, when the mountain of the Lord’s
house shall be established in the top of the mountains,
and shall be exalted above the hills,.and all nations
shall flow unto it, and many people shall go and say,
Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the
Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will
teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths:
for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of
the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among
the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they
shall beat their swords into plough-shares, and their
spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any

pass that the lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and
the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the
Lord alone shall-be exalted in that day. For the day
of the Lord of hosts soon cometh upon all nations;
yea, upon every one; yea, upon the proud and lofty,
and upon every one who is lifted up; and he shall be
brought low: yea, and the day of the Lord shall come
upon all the cedars of Lebanon, for they are high and
lifted up: and upon all the oaks of Bashan, and upon
all the high mountains, and upon all the hills, and up-
on all the nations which are lifted up, and upon every
people, and upon’ every high tower, and upon every
fenced wall, and upon all the ships of the sea; and up-
