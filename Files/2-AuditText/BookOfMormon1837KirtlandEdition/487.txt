- And tow it ame to pass that when they had taken:
ali the robbers prisoners, insomuch that none did: es-
cape who were not slain, they did cast their prisonets
into prison, and did cause the word of God to be
preached unto them; and as many as would repent of
their sins and enter into a covenant that they would
murder no more, were set at liberty; but as many as
there were who did not enter into a covenant, and who
did still continue to have those secret murders in their
hearts; yea, a8 many as-were found breathing -out
threatnings against their brethren, were condemned
and punished according to the law. And thus they
did put an end to all those wicked,. and secret, and
abominable combinations, in the which there was so
mach wickedness, and so many murders committed. .
And thus had the twenty and second year passed
away, and the twenty and third year also, and the
twenty and fourth, and the twenty and fifth: and thus
had twenty and five years passed away, and there had
many things transpired which, in the eyes of some,
would be great and marvelous; nevertheless, they can-
not all be written in this book; yea, this book cannot
contain even a hundredth -part of what was done
among 80 many people, in the space of twenty and
five years; but behold there are records which do con-
tain all the proceedings of this people; and a more
short but a true account was given by Nephi; there-
fore ] have made my record of these things according
tothe record of Nephi, which was engraven on the

lates which were called the plates of Nephi. And

hold 1 do make the record on plates which I have
made with mine own hands. And behold,  am call-
ed Mormon, being called after the land of Mormon,
the land in the which Alma did establish the church
among the people; yea, the first church which was
established among thetn after their transgression.  Be-
hold I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Thave been called of him to declare his word among
his people, that they might have everlasting life..
And it hath become expedient that I, according to the
will of God, that the prayers of those who have gone
hence, who were the holy ones, should be fulfilled ac-
cording to their faith, should make a record of these
things which have been done; yea, a small record of
which hath taken place from the time that Lehi
et Jerusalem, even down until the present time;
therefore I do: make my record from the accounts
