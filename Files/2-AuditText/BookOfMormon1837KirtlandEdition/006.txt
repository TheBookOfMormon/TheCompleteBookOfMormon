Wherefore it came to pass, that my father Lehi, as he
went forth, prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all
his heart, in behalf of his people.

And it came to pass, as he prayed unto the Lord,
there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upona rock before
him; and he saw and heard much; and because of the
things which he saw and heard, he did quake and
tremble exceedingly.

And it eame to pass that he returned to his own
house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed,
being overcome with the spirit and the things which
he had seen; and being thus overcome with the spirit,
he was carried away in a vision, even that he saw the
heavens open, and he thought he saw God sitting up-

marvellous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty!
Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and
goodness, and mercy are overall the inhabitants of the
earth; and because thou art merciful, thou wilt not
suffer those who come unto thee that they shall perish!
And after this manner was the language of my father
in the praising of his God; for. his soul did rejoice, and
his whole heart was filled, because of the things which
he had seen; yea, which the Lord: had shewn unto
