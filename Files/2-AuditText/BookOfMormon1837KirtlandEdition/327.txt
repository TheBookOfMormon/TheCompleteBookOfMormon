among the Zoramites, to preach unto them the word.

Now the. Zoramites’ were dissenters from the Ne-
phites; therefore they had the word of God preached
unto them. But they had fallen into great errors, for
they would not observe to keep the commandments of
God, and his statutes, according to the law of Moses;
neither would they observe the performances of the:
church, to continue in prayer and supplication to: Ged:
daily, that they might not enter into temptation; yea,
in fine, they did pervert the ways of the Lord in very
many instances; therefore, for this cause, Alma and
his brethren went.into the land, to preach the word
unto them,

Now when they had come into the land, behold, to
their astonishment, they found that the Zoramites
had built synagogues, and that they did’ gather them-
selves together on one day of the week, which day’
they did call the day of the Lord;. and they did wor-
ship afler a manner which Alma and his brethren had
never beheld; for they hada place built up in the cen-
tre of their synagogue, a place for standing, which
was high above the head; and the top thereof would
only admit one person. Therefore, whosoever desired
to worship, must go forth and stand upon: the’ top
thereof, and stretch forth his: hands towards, heaven;
and ery with a loud voice; saying: Holy, holy God;
we believe that thou art God, and we believe. that
thou art holy, and that thou wast. a spirit, and that’
thou arta spirit, and that thou wilt be a spirit forever,
Holy God, we believe that thou hast separated us
from our brethren; and we do not believe in the tra-
attion of our brethren, which was handed down: te
them by the childishness of their fathers; but we be-
lieve that thou hast elected us to be thy holy children;
and also thou hast made it known unto us that there
shall-be no Christ; but thou art the same, yesterday,
to-day, and forever; and thou hast elected us, that we
shall be saved, whilst all around us'areeleeted to be
cast by thy wrath down to hell; for the which’ holi-
ness, O God, we thank thee; and: we also thank thee
that thou hast elected us, that we may not be led”
away after the foolish traditions of our brethren, which
doth bind them down to a belief of Christ, whichdoth
lead their hearts to wander far’ from’ thee, our God:
And again:’ We thank thee, O God, that we'are a
chosen and’a holy people. Amen: <0
