manded him. And they departed ou! of the land into the
wilderness, as many a8 would hearken unto the voice of she
Lord; and hey were led by many preachings and prophesyings,
And they were admonished continually by the word of God
and they were led by the power of his arm, through the x
derness, until they came down into the land which is called the
land of Zarahemla. And they discovered a people, who were
called the people of Zarahemla. Now, there was great rejo
among the people of Zurahemla; and also, Zaraherila did rejuice
exceedingly, because the Lord had sent the people of Mosiah

7, Behold, it came to pass that Mosiah discovered that the
people of Zarahemla, came out from Jerusalem, at the tine that
