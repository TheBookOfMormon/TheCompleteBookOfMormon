was commanded to say no more of the Father concerning this
thing unto them. But, verily, I say unto you, that the Father
hath commanded me, and I 'tell it unto you, that ye were
separated from among them because of their iniquity; therefore
it ig because of their iniquity, that they know not of you. Aud
verily, [ say unto you again, that the other tribes hath the
Fatner sepirated from thems and it iy because of their iniquity,
that they know not of them: And verily, I say unto you, that
ye are they of whom I said, Other sleep I have which are not
of this fold; them also T must bring, and they shall hear my
voice; und there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. And
they understood mo not, for tley supposed it had been the Gen-
tiles; for they understood not that the Gentiles should be eon-
verted thronigh thelr preaching; and they wuderstood me wot
that I said they shall hear my voice; and they understood me
