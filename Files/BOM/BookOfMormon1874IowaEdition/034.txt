the earth, that they were broken up; and I saw many cities,
that they were sunk; and I saw many that were burned with
fire; and I saw many that did tumble to the earth, because of
the quaking thereof,

25. And it came to pass after I saw these things, I saw the
vapor of darkness, that it passed from off the face of the earth;
and behold, I saw multitudes who had fallen, because of the
great and terrible judgments of the Lord, And I saw tho
heavens open, and the Lamb of God descending out of heaven;
and he came down and shewed himself unto them. And I also
saw und bear record that the Holy Ghost fell upon twelve oth-
