to pass that the voice of the people came, saying, We are desir-
ous that Aaron, thy son, should be our king, and our ruler.
Now Aaron had gone up to the land of Nephi, therefore the
king could not confer the kingdom upon him: neither would
Aaron take upon him the kingdom; neither were any of the
gons of Mosiah willing to take upon them the kingdom, there-
fore king Mosiah sent again among the peple, yea, even a writ-
ten word sent he among the people, And these were the words
that were written; saying: Behold, O ye my people, or my
brethren, for I esteem you as such, for I desire that ye should
consider the cause which ye are called to consider; lor ye are
desirous to have a king. Now I declare unto you, that he to
whom the kingdom doth rightly belong, has declined, and will

appoint wise men to be judges, that will judge this people ac-
cording to the commandients of God. Now it is better that a
man should be judged of God than of man, for the judzmenta
