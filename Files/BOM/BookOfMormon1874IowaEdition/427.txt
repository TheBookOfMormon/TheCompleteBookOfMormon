cHaP vj BOOK OF HELAMAN. 415

And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall believe on the
Son of God, the same shall have everlasting life. Aud behold,
thus hath the Lord commanded me, by his angel, that I should
come and tell this thing unto you; yea, he hath commanded
that I should prophesy these things unto you; yea, he hath said
unto ine, Cry uuto this people, repent ard prepare the way of
the Lord. And now because Iam a Lamanite, and have spoken
unto you the words which the Lord hath commanded me, and
becativo it was hard against you, ye are angry with me, and do
seek to destroy me, und have cast me out from among you.
And ye slmll hear my words, for, for this intent have T come up
upon the walls of this city, that ye might hear and know of the
judgments of God which do await you becanse of your iniqui-
ties, and also that ye might know the conditions of repentance;
and also that ye might Know of the coming of Jesus Christ, the
Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, the Creator of all
things, from the beginning; and that ye might know of the signs
of his coming, to the intent that ye might believe on his name,
‘And if ye believe on his name, ye will repent of all your
that thereby ye may have a remission of them through his
Boris, And behold, sgain, another sign T give unto you; yea
a sign of his death; for behold, ie surely must die, that salva-
tion may come; yea, it behooveth him, and becometh expedient,
that he dieth, to bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, that
thereby men may be brought into the presence of the Lord;
yea, behold this death bringeth to pass the resurrection, and
Tedeemeth all mankind from the first death; that spiritual death
for all mankind, by the fall of Adam, being eut off from the
presence of the Lord, or considered as ded, both as to the
things temporal and to things spiritual, But behold, the resur-
rection of Christ redeemeth maukind, yea, even all mankind, and
bringeth them back into the presence of the Lord; yea, aud it
bringeth to pass the condition of repentance, that whosoever
repenteth, the same is uot hewa down and cast into the fire;
but whosoever repenteth not, is hewn down aud east into the
fire, and there cometh npon them again a spiritual death, yea, a
seemd death, for they are cut off again as to things pertaining
to righteousness; therefore repent ye, repent ye, lest by know-
ing these things and not doing thera, ye shall suffer yourselves
to come under condemnation, aud ye are brought down «to
this second death.

7. But bebold, as I said unto you concerning another sign, a
sign of his death, behold, in that day that he shall suffer death,
the sun shall be durkened and refuse to give his light unto you;
and also the moon, aud the stars; wod there shall be no light
