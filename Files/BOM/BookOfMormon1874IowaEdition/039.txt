over all the earth; and the time cometh that he shall manifest
himself unto all nations, both unto the Jews, and also unto the
Gentiles; and after he las manifested himself unto the Jews,
‘and .also unto the Gentiles; then he shall manifest himself unto
the Gentiles, and also unto the Jews, and the last shall be first,
and the first shall be last,

en imto the Lamb of God in that day that he shall nunifest
himself wato them in word, and also in power, in very deed,
unto the taking away of their stumblingblocks, and harden not
their hearts against the Lamb of God, they shall be numbered
