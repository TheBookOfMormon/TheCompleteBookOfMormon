judgment day; whereof, they shall be judged, every man,
‘according to his works, whether they be good, or whether
they be evil; and if they be evil, they are consigned to au
awful view of their own guilt and abominations, which doth
cause them to slirink from the presence of the Lord, into x
state of misery and endless torment, from whence they «:
no more return: therefore, they have drunk darmation 19
their own souls, Therefore, they have drunk out of the enp
of the wratl of God, which justice contd no more deny untu
them, than it could deny that Adam should fall, beeause of
his partaking of the forbidden fruit; therefore, merey could
have claim on tiem no more forever. And their torment is

able, and whose smoke asvendeth up forever and ever. Thus
hatli-the Lord commanded me. Amen.
