called Amalickiahites,

11, And it came to pass that when Amalickiah saw that the
people of Moroni were more numerous than the Amalickiahites;
and he also saw that his people were donbtfry concerning the
justice of tie cause in which they had undertaken; therefore,
Yeariug he should not gain the point, he took those of his peo-

12, Now Moron thought it was not expedient that the
