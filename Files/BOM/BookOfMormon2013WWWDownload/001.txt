UPON PLATES
TAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHI

Wherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and
also of the Lamanites—Written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the
house of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile—Written by way of command-
ment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation—Written and
sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed—To
come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof—
Sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in
due time by way of the Gentile—The interpretation thereof by the gift
of God.

An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a record of
the people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded
the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to
heaven—Which is to show unto the remnant of the house of Israel what
great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they may know
the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever—And also to
the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the
ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations—And now, if there
are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn not the things
of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ.

TRANSLATED BY JOSEPH SMITH, Jun.

THE FIRST BOOK OF NEPHI

HIS REIGN AND MINISTRY

An account of Lehi and his wife Sariah, and his four sons, being called, (be-
ginning at the eldest) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. The Lord warns Lehi
to depart out of the land of Jerusalem, because he prophesieth unto the people
concerning their iniquity and they seek to destroy his life. He taketh three days’
journey into the wilderness with his family. Nephi taketh his brethren and
returneth to the land of Jerusalem after the record of the Jews, The account of
their sufferings. They take the daughters of Ishmael to wife. They take their
families and depart into the wilderness. Their sufferings and afflictions in the
wilderness, The course of their travels. They come to the large waters. Nephi’s
brethren rebel against him. He confoundeth them, and buildeth a ship. They
call the name of the place Bountiful. They cross the large waters into the
promised land, and so forth. This is according to the account of Nephi; or in
other words, I, Nephi, wrote this record.

CHAPTER 1
Nephi begins the record of his people—

Lehi sees in vision a pillar of fire and
reads from a book of prophecy—He
praises God, foretells the coming of the
Messiah, and prophesies the destruction
of Jerusalem—He is persecuted by the
Jews. About 600 B.C.


I, NEPHI, having been born
of goodly ‘parents, therefore I

was taught somewhat in all the
learning of my father; and having
seen many afflictions in the course
of my days, nevertheless, having
been highly favored of the Lord in all
my days; yea, having had a great
knowledge of the goodness and
the mysteries of God, therefore I
make a record of my proceedings
in my days.

2 Yea, I make a record in the lan-
guage of my father, which consists
of the learning of the Jews and the
language of the Egyptians.

3 And I know that the record which
I make is true; and I make it with
mine own hand; and I make it ac-
cording to my knowledge.

4 For it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the “first year of the
reign of *Zedekiah, king of Judah,
(my father, Lehi, having dwelt at
‘Jerusalem in all his days); and in
that same year there came many
4prophets, prophesying unto the
people that they must “repent, or
the great city Jerusalem must be
destroyed.

5 Wherefore it came to pass that
my father, Lehi, as he went forth
prayed unto the Lord, yea, even

with all his “heart, in behalf of his
people.

6 And it came to pass as he prayed
unto the Lord, there came a “pillar
of fire and dwelt upon a rock before
him; and he saw and heard much;
and because of the things which he
saw and heard he did quake and
tremble exceedingly.

7 And it came to pass that he re-
turned to his own house at Jeru-
salem; and he cast himself upon
his bed, being “overcome with the
Spirit and the things which he had
seen.

8 And being thus overcome with
the Spirit, he was carried away
in a “vision, even that he saw the
bheavens open, and he thought he
‘saw God sitting upon his throne,
surrounded with numberless con-
courses of angels in the attitude
of singing and praising their God.

9 And it came to pass that he saw
One descending out of the midst
of heaven, and he beheld that his
“luster was above that of the sun
at noon-day.

10 And he also saw “twelve others
following him, and their brightness
did exceed that of the stars in the
firmament.

11 And they came down and went
forth upon the face of the earth; and
the first came and “stood before my
father, and gave unto him a ’book,
and bade him that he should read.

12 And it came to pass that as he

 

2

read, he was filled with the “Spirit
of the Lord.

13 And he read, saying: Wo, wo,
unto Jerusalem, for I have seen
thine “abominations! Yea, and many
things did my father read concern-
ing °Jerusalem—that it should be
destroyed, and the inhabitants
thereof; many should perish by the
sword, and many should be ‘carried
away captive into Babylon.

14 And it came to pass that when
my father had read and seen many
great and marvelous things, he did
exclaim many things unto the Lord;
such as: Great and marvelous are
thy works, O Lord God Almighty!
Thy throne is high in the heavens,
and thy “power, and goodness, and
mercy are over all the inhabitants
of the earth; and, because thou art
merciful, thou wilt not suffer those
who ’come unto thee that they shall
perish!

15 And after this manner was
the language of my father in the
praising of his God; for his soul did
rejoice, and his whole heart was
filled, because of the things which
he had seen, yea, which the Lord
had shown unto him.

16 And now I, Nephi, do not make
a full account of the things which
my father hath written, for he hath
written many things which he saw
in “visions and in ’dreams; and
he also hath written many things
which he ‘prophesied and spake

unto his children, of which I shall
not make a full account.

17 But I shall make an account of
my proceedings in my days. Behold,
I make an abridgment of the record
of my "father, upon ‘plates which I
have made with mine own hands;
wherefore, after I have abridged
the record of my “father then willI
make an account of mine own life.

18 Therefore, I would that ye
should know, that after the Lord had
shown so many marvelous things
unto my father, Lehi, yea, concern-
ing the “destruction of Jerusalem,
behold he went forth among the
people, and began to "prophesy
and to declare unto them concern-
ing the things which he had both
seen and heard.

19 And it came to pass that the
“Jews did "mock him because of the
things which he testified of them;
for he truly testified of their ‘wick-
edness and their abominations; and
he testified that the things which he
saw and heard, and also the things
which he read in the book, mani-
fested plainly of the coming of a
4Messiah, and also the redemption
of the world.

20 And when the Jews heard these
things they were angry with him;
yea, even as with the prophets of
old, whom they had cast out, and
stoned, and slain; and they also
’sought his life, that they might
take it away. But behold, I, Nephi,
will show unto you that the tender
‘mercies of the Lord are over all

 

1 NEPHI 1:17-2:4

those whom he hath chosen, be-
cause of their faith, to make them
mighty even unto the power of
4deliverance.

CHAPTER 2

Lehi takes his family into the wilder-
ness by the Red Sea—They leave their
property—Lehi offers a sacrifice to the
Lord and teaches his sons to keep the
commandments—Laman and Lemuel
murmur against their father—Nephi is
obedient and prays in faith; the Lord
speaks to him, and he is chosen to rule
over his brethren. About 600 B.c.

For behold, it came to pass that
the Lord spake unto my father, yea,
even in a dream, and said unto him:
Blessed art thou Lehi, because of
the things which thou hast done;
and because thou hast been faithful
and declared unto this people the
things which I commanded thee,
behold, they seek to “take away
thy “life.

2 And it came to pass that the Lord
“commanded my father, even in a
b’dream, that he should ‘take his fam-
ily and depart into the wilderness.

3 And it came to pass that he was
“obedient unto the word of the Lord,
wherefore he did as the Lord com-
manded him.

4 And it came to pass that he de-
parted into the wilderness. And
he left his house, and the land of
his inheritance, and his gold, and
his silver, and his precious things,
and took nothing with him, save it

were his family, and provisions,
and tents, and “departed into the
wilderness.

5 And he came down by the bor-
ders near the shore of the “Red Sea;
and he traveled in the wilderness
in the borders which are nearer the
Red Sea; and he did travel in the
wilderness with his family, which
consisted of my mother, Sariah,
and my elder brothers, who were
Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.

6 And it came to pass that when he
had traveled three days in the wilder-
ness, he pitched his tent in a “valley
by the side of a °river of water.

7 And it came to pass that he built
an “altar of "stones, and made an
‘offering unto the Lord, and gave
“thanks unto the Lord our God.

8 And it came to pass that he called
the name of the river, Laman, and
it emptied into the Red Sea; and
the valley was in the borders near
the mouth thereof.

9 And when my father saw that
the waters of the river emptied
into the “fountain of the Red Sea,
he spake unto Laman, saying: O
that thou mightest be like unto this
river, continually running into the
fountain of all righteousness!

10 And he also spake unto Lem-
uel: O that thou mightest be like
unto this valley, “firm and ’stead-
fast, and immovable in keeping the
commandments of the Lord!

11 Now this he spake because of
the ‘stiffneckedness of Laman and

 

4

Lemuel; for behold they did "mur-
mur in many things against their
‘father, because he was a “visionary
man, and had led them out of the
land of Jerusalem, to leave the land
of their inheritance, and their gold,
and their silver, and their precious
things, to perish in the wilderness.
And this they said he had done be-
cause of the foolish imaginations
of his heart.

12 And thus Laman and Lemuel,
being the eldest, did murmur against
their “father. And they did *’murmur
because they ‘knew not the deal-
ings of that God who had “created
them.

13 Neither did they “believe that
Jerusalem, that great city, could be
’destroyed according to the words
of the prophets. And they were like
unto the Jews who were at Jerusa-
lem, who sought to take away the
life of my father.

14 And it came to pass that my
father did speak unto them in the
“valley of Lemuel, with "power,
being filled with the Spirit, until
their frames did ‘shake before him.
And he did confound them, that
they durst not utter against him;
wherefore, they did as he com-
manded them.

15 And my father dwelt in a “tent.

16 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, being exceedingly young,
nevertheless being large in stat-
ure, and also having great desires
to know of the ¢mysteries of God,

wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord;
and behold he did visit me, and
did ‘soften my heart that I did “be-
lieve all the words which had been
spoken by my “father; wherefore, I
did not ‘rebel against him like unto
my brothers.

17 And I spake unto Sam, making
known unto him the things which
the Lord had manifested unto me
by his Holy Spirit. And it came to
pass that he believed in my words.

18 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel
would not hearken unto my words;
and being “grieved because of the
hardness of their hearts I cried unto
the Lord for them.

19 And it came to pass that the
Lord spake unto me, saying: Blessed
art thou, Nephi, because of thy
*faith, for thou hast sought me
diligently, with lowliness of heart.

20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep
my commandments, ye shall ¢pros-
per, and shall be led to a "land of
promise; yea, even a land which I
have prepared for you; yea, a land
which is choice above all other
lands.

21 And inasmuch as thy brethren
shall rebel against thee, they shall
be “cut off from the presence of
the Lord.

22 And inasmuch as thou shalt
keep my commandments, thou
shalt be made a4ruler and a teacher
over thy brethren.

23 For behold, in that day that
they shall “rebel against me, I will
’curse them even with a sore curse,
and they shall have no power over

 

1 NEPHI 2:17-3:5

thy seed except they shall ‘rebel
against me also.

24 And if it so be that they rebel
against me, they shall be a “scourge
unto thy seed, to ’stir them up in
the ways of remembrance.

CHAPTER 3

Lehi’s sons return to Jerusalem to ob-
tain the plates of brass—Laban refuses
to give the plates up—Nephi exhorts
and encourages his brethren—Laban
steals their property and attempts to
slay them—Laman and Lemuel smite
Nephi and Sam and are reproved by
an angel. About 600-592 B.c.

AND it came to pass that I, Nephi,
returned from “speaking with the
Lord, to the tent of my father.

2 And it came to pass that he spake
unto me, saying: Behold I have
dreamed a “dream, in the which
the Lord hath commanded me that
thou and thy brethren shall "return
to Jerusalem.

3 For behold, Laban hath the
record of the Jews and also a “ge-
nealogy of my forefathers, and
they are "engraven upon plates of
brass.

4 Wherefore, the Lord hath com-
manded me that thou and thy
brothers should go unto the house
of Laban, and seek the records, and
bring them down hither into the
wilderness.

5 And now, behold thy brothers
murmur, saying it is a hard thing
which I have required of them; but
behold I have not required it of

them, but it is a commandment of
the Lord.

6 Therefore go, my son, and thou
shalt be favored of the Lord, because
thou hast ¢not "murmured.

7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,
said unto my father: I ¢will go and
do the things which the Lord hath
commanded, for I know that the
Lord giveth no ’commandments
unto the children of men, save he
shall ‘prepare a way for them that
they may accomplish the thing
which he commandeth them.

8 And it came to pass that when
my father had heard these words he
was exceedingly glad, for he knew
that I had been blessed of the Lord.

9 And I, Nephi, and my brethren
took our journey in the wilderness,
with our tents, to go up to the land
of Jerusalem.

10 And it came to pass that when
we had gone up to the land of Je-
rusalem, I and my brethren did
consult one with another.

11 And we “cast lots—who of us
should go in unto the house of Laban.
And it came to pass that the lot fell
upon Laman; and Laman went in
unto the house of Laban, and he
talked with him as he sat in his
house.

12 And he desired of Laban the
records which were engraven upon
the plates of brass, which contained
the “genealogy of my father.

13 And behold, it came to pass
that Laban was angry, and thrust
him out from his presence; and he
would not that he should have the
records, Wherefore, he said unto
him: Behold thou art a robber, and
I will slay thee.

 

6

14 But Laman fled out of his pres-
ence, and told the things which La-
ban had done, unto us. And we began
to be exceedingly sorrowful, and
my brethren were about to return
unto my father in the wilderness.

15 But behold I said unto them
that: “As the Lord liveth, and as we
live, we will not go down unto our
father in the wilderness until we
have ’accomplished the thing which
the Lord hath commanded us,

16 Wherefore, let us be faithful
in keeping the commandments of
the Lord; therefore let us go down
to the land of our father’s inheri-
tance, for behold he left gold and
silver, and all manner of riches,
And all this he hath done because
of the "commandments of the Lord.

17 For he knew that Jerusalem
must be “destroyed, because of the
wickedness of the people.

18 For behold, they have “rejected
the words of the prophets. Where-
fore, if my father should dwell in the
land after he hath been °commanded
to flee out of the land, behold, he
would also perish. Wherefore, it
must needs be that he flee out of
the land.

19 And behold, it is wisdom in
God that we should obtain these
“records, that we may preserve
unto our children the language of
our fathers;

20 And also that we may “preserve
unto them the words which have
been spoken by the mouth of all
the holy 'prophets, which have
been delivered unto them by the
Spirit and power of God, since the
world began, even down unto this
present time.

21 And it came to pass that af-
ter this manner of language did I
“persuade my brethren, that they
might be faithful in keeping the
commandments of God.

22 And it came to pass that we
went down to the land of our inheri-
tance, and we did gather together
our “gold, and our silver, and our
precious things.

23 And after we had gathered these
things together, we went up again
unto the house of Laban.

24 And it came to pass that we
went in unto Laban, and desired
him that he would give unto us the
records which were engraven upon
the “plates of brass, for which we
would give unto him our gold, and our
silver, and all our precious things.

25 And it came to pass that when
Laban saw our property, and that it
was exceedingly great, he did “lust
after it, insomuch that he thrust us
out, and sent his servants to slay us,
that he might obtain our property.

26 And “it came to pass that we
did flee before the servants of La-
ban, and we were obliged to leave
behind our property, and it fell into
the hands of Laban.

27 And it came to pass that we
fled into the wilderness, and the
servants of Laban did not overtake
us, and we “hid ourselves in the
cavity of a rock.

28 And it came to pass that Laman
was angry with me, and also with
my father; and also was Lemuel,
for he hearkened unto the words
of Laman. Wherefore Laman and
Lemuel did speak many “hard words
unto us, their younger brothers, and
they did smite us even with a rod.

29 And it came to pass as they

 

1 NEPHI 3:21-4:2

smote us with a rod, behold, an
“angel of the Lord came and stood
before them, and he spake unto
them, saying: Why do ye smite your
younger brother with a rod? Know
ye not that the Lord hath chosen
him to be a ’ruler over you, and this
because of your iniquities? Behold
ye shall go up to Jerusalem again,
and the Lord will ‘deliver Laban
into your hands.

30 And after the “angel had spo-
ken unto us, he departed.

31 And after the angel had de-
parted, Laman and Lemuel again
began to “murmur, saying: How is
it possible that the Lord will deliver
Laban into our hands? Behold, he
is a mighty man, and he can com-
mand fifty, yea, even he can slay
fifty; then why not us?

CHAPTER 4

Nephi slays Laban at the Lord’s com-
mand and then secures the plates of
brass by stratagem—Zoram chooses
to join Lehi’s family in the wilderness.
About 600-592 B.c.

AND it came to pass that I spake
unto my brethren, saying: Let us
go up again unto Jerusalem, and
let us be “faithful in keeping the
commandments of the Lord; for
behold he is mightier than all the
earth, then why not ’mightier than
Laban and his fifty, yea, or even
than his tens of thousands?

2 Therefore let us go up; let us
be “strong like unto Moses; for he
truly spake unto the waters of the
’Red Sea and they divided hither
and thither, and our fathers came
through, out of captivity, on dry
ground, and the armies of Pharaoh

did follow and were drowned in the
waters of the Red Sea.

3 Now behold ye know that this is
true; and ye also know that an “an-
gel hath spoken unto you; where-
fore can ye "doubt? Let us go up; the
Lord is able to ‘deliver us, even as
our fathers, and to destroy Laban,
even as the Egyptians.

4 Now when I had spoken these
words, they were yet wroth, and did
still continue to murmur; neverthe-
less they did follow me up until we
came without the walls of Jerusalem.

5 And it was by night; and I caused
that they should hide themselves
without the walls. And after they
had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept
into the city and went forth towards
the house of Laban.

6 And I was “led by the Spirit, not
’knowing beforehand the things
which I should do,

7 Nevertheless I went forth, and
as I came near unto the house of
Laban I beheld a man, and he had
fallen to the earth before me, for
he was “drunken with wine.

8 And when I came to him I found
that it was Laban.

9 And I beheld his “sword, and
I drew it forth from the sheath
thereof; and the hilt thereof was
of pure gold, and the workmanship
thereof was exceedingly fine, and
I saw that the blade thereof was of
the most precious steel.

10 And it came to pass that I was
“constrained by the Spirit that I
should kill Laban; but I said in my
heart: Never at any time have I shed
the blood of man. And I shrunk and
would that I might not slay him.

 

8

11 And the Spirit said unto me
again: Behold the “Lord hath *deliv-
ered him into thy hands. Yea, and
I also knew that he had sought to
take away mine own life; yea, and
he would not hearken unto the
commandments of the Lord; and he
also had ‘taken away our property.

12 And it came to pass that the
Spirit said unto me again: Slay him,
for the Lord hath delivered him
into thy hands;

13 Behold the Lord ¢slayeth the
’wicked to bring forth his righ-
teous purposes. It is ‘better that
one man should perish than that a
nation should dwindle and perish
in “unbelief.

14 And now, when I, Nephi, had
heard these words, I remembered
the words of the Lord which he
spake unto me in the wilderness,
saying that: “Inasmuch as thy seed
shall keep my "commandments,
they shall ‘prosper in the “land of
promise.

15 Yea, and Lalso thought that they
could not keep the commandments
of the Lord according to the “law of
Moses, save they should have the law.

16 And I also knew that the “law
was engraven upon the plates of
brass.

17 And again, I knew that the Lord
had delivered Laban into my hands
for this cause—that I might obtain
the records according to his com-
mandments.

18 Therefore I did obey the voice
of the Spirit, and took Laban by
the hair of the head, and I smote
off his head with his own “sword.

19 And after I had smitten off his

head with his own sword, I took the
garments of Laban and put them
upon mine own body; yea, even
every whit; and I did gird on his
armor about my loins.

20 And after I had done this, I went
forth unto the treasury of Laban.
And as I went forth towards the
treasury of Laban, behold, I saw the
4servant of Laban who had the keys
of the treasury. And Il commanded
him in the voice of Laban, that he
should go with me into the treasury.

21 And he supposed me to be his
master, Laban, for he beheld the
garments and also the sword girded
about my loins.

22 And he spake unto me con-
cerning the “elders of the Jews, he
knowing that his master, Laban,
had been out by night among them.

23 And I spake unto him as if it
had been Laban.

24 And Lalso spake unto him that I
should carry the engravings, which
were upon the “plates of brass, to
my elder brethren, who were with-
out the walls.

25 And I also bade him that he
should follow me.

26 And he, supposing that Ispake
of the “brethren of the °church, and
that I was truly that Laban whom
I had slain, wherefore he did fol-
low me.

27 And he spake unto me many
times concerning the elders of the
Jews, as | went forth unto my breth-
ren, who were without the walls.

28 And it came to pass that when
Laman saw me he was exceedingly
frightened, and also Lemuel and
Sam. And they fled from before
my presence; for they supposed it
was Laban, and that he had slain
me and had sought to take away
their lives also.

29 And it came to pass that I called

 

1 NEPHI 4:20-37

after them, and they did hear me;
wherefore they did cease to flee
from my presence.

30 And it came to pass that when
the servant of Laban beheld my
brethren he began to tremble, and
was about to flee from before me
and return to the city of Jerusalem.

31 And now 1, Nephi, being a man
large in stature, and also having re-
ceived much “strength of the Lord,
therefore I did seize upon the ser-
vant of Laban, and held him, that
he should not flee.

32 And it came to pass that I spake
with him, that if he would hearken
unto my words, as the Lord liveth,
and as I live, even so that if he would
hearken unto our words, we would
spare his life.

33 And I spake unto him, even
with an “oath, that he need not fear;
that he should be a *free man like
unto us if he would go down in the
wilderness with us.

34 And I also spake unto him,
saying: Surely the Lord hath *com-
manded us to do this thing; and shall
we not be diligent in keeping the
commandments of the Lord? There-
fore, if thou wilt go down into the
wilderness to my father thou shalt
have place with us.

35 And it came to pass that *7Zoram
did take courage at the words which
Ispake. Now Zoram was the name of
the servant; and he promised that he
would go down into the wilderness
unto our father. Yea, and he also
made an oath unto us that he would
tarry with us from that time forth.

36 Now we were desirous that he
should tarry with us for this cause,
that the Jews might not know con-
cerning our flight into the wilder-
ness, lest they should pursue us and
destroy us.

37 And it came to pass that when

1 NEPHI 4:38-5:11

Zoram had made an “oath unto us,
our ’fears did cease concerning him.

38 And it came to pass that we
took the plates of brass and the ser-
vant of Laban, and departed into
the wilderness, and journeyed unto
the “tent of our father.

CHAPTER 5

Sariah complains against Lehi—Both
rejoice over the return of their sons—
They offer sacrifices—The plates of
brass contain writings of Moses and the
prophets—The plates identify Lehias a
descendant of Joseph—Lehi prophesies
concerning his seed and the preserva-
tion of the plates. About 600-592 B.c.

AND it came to pass that after we
had come down into the wilderness
unto our father, behold, he was filled
with joy, and also my mother, Sa-
riah, was exceedingly glad, for she
truly had mourned because of us.

2 For she had supposed that we
had perished in the wilderness; and
she also had ¢complained against
my father, telling him that he was
a visionary man; saying: Behold
thou hast led us forth from the land
of our inheritance, and my sons
are no more, and we perish in the
wilderness.

3 And after this manner of lan-
guage had my mother complained
against my father.

4 And it had come to pass that
my father spake unto her, saying:
I Know that Lam a “visionary man;
for if 1 had not seen the things of
God in a vision I should not have
known the goodness of God, but
had tarried at Jerusalem, and had
perished with my brethren.

 

10

5 But behold, I have “obtained a
‘land of promise, in the which things
I do rejoice; yea, and I “know that
the Lord will deliver my sons out of
the hands of Laban, and bring them
down again unto us in the wilderness.

6 And after this manner of lan-
guage did my father, Lehi, comfort
my mother, Sariah, concerning us,
while we journeyed in the wilder-
ness up to the land of Jerusalem,
to obtain the record of the Jews.

7 And when we had returned to
the tent of my father, behold their
joy was full, and my mother was
comforted.

8 And she spake, saying: Now I
know of asurety that the Lord hath
“commanded my husband to *flee
into the wilderness; yea, and I also
know of asurety that the Lord hath
protected my sons, and delivered
them out of the hands of Laban,
and given them power whereby
they could ‘accomplish the thing
which the Lord hath commanded
them. And after this manner of
language did she speak.

9 And it came to pass that they did
rejoice exceedingly, and did offer
*sacrifice and burnt offerings unto
the Lord; and they gave ’thanks
unto the God of Israel.

10 And after they had given thanks
unto the God of Israel, my father,
Lehi, took the records which were
engraven upon the “plates of brass,
and he did search them from the
beginning.

11 And he beheld that they did
contain the five “books of Moses,
which gave an account of the cre-
ation of the world, and also of Adam
and Eve, who were our first parents;

12 And also a “record of the Jews
from the beginning, even down to
the commencement of the reign of
Zedekiah, king of Judah;

13 And also the prophecies of the
holy prophets, from the beginning,
even down to the commencement
of the reign of “Zedekiah; and also
many prophecies which have been
spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah.

14 And it came to pass that my
father, Lehi, also found upon the
“plates of brass a 'genealogy of his
‘fathers; wherefore he knew that
he was a descendant of “Joseph;
yea, even that Joseph who was the
son of ‘Jacob, who was ‘sold into
Egypt, and who was ‘preserved by
the hand of the Lord, that he might
preserve his father, Jacob, and all
his household from perishing with
famine.

15 And they were also “led out
of captivity and out of the land of
Egypt, by that same God who had
preserved them.

16 And thus my father, Lehi, did
discover the genealogy of his fathers.
And Laban also was a descendant
of “Joseph, wherefore he and his
fathers had kept the ’records.

17 And now when my father saw
all these things, he was filled with
the Spirit, and began to prophesy
concerning his seed—

18 That these “plates of brass
should go forth unto all 'nations,
kindreds, tongues, and people who
were of his seed.

19 Wherefore, he said that these

 

1 NEPHI 5:12-6:3

plates of brass should “never perish;
neither should they be dimmed any
more by time. And he prophesied
many things concerning his seed.

20 And it came to pass that thus
far I and my father had kept the
commandments wherewith the
Lord had commanded us.

21 And we had obtained the records
which the Lord had commanded us,
and searched them and found that
they were desirable; yea, even of
great “worth unto us, insomuch that
we could ’preserve the command-
ments of the Lord unto our children.

22 Wherefore, it was wisdom in the
Lord that we should carry them with
us, aS we journeyed in the wilder-
ness towards the land of promise.

CHAPTER 6

Nephi writes of the things of God—
Nephi’s purpose is to persuade men to

AND now I, Nephi, do not give the
genealogy of my fathers in “this
part of my record; neither at any
time shall I give it after upon these
’plates which I am ‘writing; for it is
given in the record which has been
kept by my “father; wherefore, I do
not write it in this work.

2 For it sufficeth me to say that we
are descendants of “Joseph.

3 And it mattereth not to me that I
am particular to give a full account
of all the things of my father, for
they cannot be written upon “these

CHAPTER 7

Lehi’s sons return to Jerusalem and
invite Ishmael and his household to
join them in their journey—Laman
and others rebel—Nephi exhorts his
brethren to have faith in the Lord—
They bind him with cords and plan his
destruction—He is freed by the power
of faith—His brethren ask forgiveness—
Lehi and his company offer sacrifice
and burnt offerings. About 600—592 B.c.

AND now I would that ye might
know, that after my father, Lehi,
had made an end of “prophesying
concerning his seed, it came to pass
that the Lord spake unto him again,
saying that it was not meet for him,
Lehi, that he should take his fam-
ily into the wilderness alone; but
that his sons should take 'daugh-
ters to ‘wife, that they might raise
up “seed unto the Lord in the land
of promise.

2 And it came to pass that the Lord
“commanded him that I, Nephi, and
my brethren, should again return
unto the land of Jerusalem, and

 

12

bring down Ishmael and his family
into the wilderness.

3 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,
did “again, with my brethren, go
forth into the wilderness to go up
to Jerusalem.

4 And it came to pass that we
went up unto the house of Ishmael,
and we did gain favor in the sight
of Ishmael, insomuch that we did
speak unto him the words of the
Lord.

5 And it came to pass that the “Lord
did soften the heart of Ishmael,
and also his household, insomuch
that they took their journey with
us down into the wilderness to the
tent of our father.

6 And it came to pass that as we
journeyed in the wilderness, be-
hold Laman and Lemuel, and two
of the “daughters of Ishmael, and
the two "sons of Ishmael and their
families, did ‘rebel against us; yea,
against me, Nephi, and Sam, and
their father, Ishmael, and his wife,
and his three other daughters.

7 And it came to pass in the which
rebellion, they were desirous to re-
turn unto the land of Jerusalem.

8 And now I, Nephi, being “grieved
for the hardness of their hearts,
therefore I spake unto them, say-
ing, yea, even unto Laman and unto
Lemuel: Behold ye are mine elder
brethren, and how is it that ye
are so hard in your hearts, and so
blind in your minds, that ye have
need that I, your "younger brother,
should speak unto you, yea, and set
an ‘example for you?

9 How is it that ye have not heark-
ened unto the word of the Lord?

10 How is it that ye have “forgot-

11 Yea, and how is it that ye have
forgotten what great things the
Lord hath done for us, in “delivering
us out of the hands of Laban, and
also that we should obtain the
record?

12 Yea, and how is it that ye have
forgotten that the Lord is able to
do all “things according to his will,
for the children of men, if it so be
that they exercise "faith in him?
Wherefore, let us be faithful to him.

13 And if it so be that we are faith-
ful to him, we shall obtain the “land
of promise; and ye shall know at
some future period that the word of
the Lord shall be fulfilled concern-
ing the destruction of ‘Jerusalem;
for all things which the Lord hath
spoken concerning the destruction
of Jerusalem must be fulfilled.

14 For behold, the “Spirit of the
Lord ’ceaseth soon to strive with
them; for behold, they have ‘re-
jected the prophets, and “Jeremiah
have they cast into prison. And they
have sought to take away the ‘life
of my father, insomuch that they
have driven him out of the land.

15 Now behold, I say unto you that
if ye will return unto Jerusalem ye
shall also perish with them. And
now, if ye have choice, go up to
the land, and remember the words
which I speak unto you, that if ye
go ye will also perish; for thus the
Spirit of the Lord constraineth me
that I should speak.

16 And it came to pass that when
I, Nephi, had spoken these words
unto my brethren, they were angry
with me. And it came to pass that
they did lay their hands upon me,
for behold, they were exceedingly
wroth, and they did “bind me with

 

1 NEPHI 7:11-22

cords, for they sought to take away
my life, that they might leave me
in the wilderness to be devoured
by wild beasts.

17 But it came to pass that I prayed
unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, ac-
cording to my faith which is in thee,
wilt thou deliver me from the hands
of my brethren; yea, even give me
“strength that I may "burst these
bands with which I am bound.

18 And it came to pass that when
I had said these words, behold, the
bands were loosed from off my
hands and feet, and I stood before
my brethren, and I spake unto them
again.

19 And it came to pass that they
were angry with me again, and
sought to lay hands upon me; but
behold, one of the “daughters of
Ishmael, yea, and also her mother,
and one of the sons of Ishmael, did
plead with my brethren, insomuch
that they did soften their hearts;
and they did cease striving to take
away my life.

20 And it came to pass that they
were sorrowful, because of their
wickedness, insomuch that they
did bow down before me, and did
plead with me that I would “forgive
them of the thing that they had
done against me.

21 And it came to pass that I did
frankly “forgive them all that they
had done, and I did exhort them
that they would pray unto the Lord
their God for ’forgiveness. And it
came to pass that they did so. And
after they had done praying unto
the Lord we did again travel on
our journey towards the tent of our
father.

22 And it came to pass that we did

come down unto the tent of our
father. And after land my brethren
and all the house of Ishmael had come
down unto the tent of my father, they
did give “thanks unto the Lord their
God; and they did offer "sacrifice
and burnt offerings unto him.

CHAPTER 8

Lehi sees a vision of the tree of life—
He partakes of its fruit and desires his
family to do likewise—He sees a rod of
iron, a strait and narrow path, and the
mists of darkness that enshroud men—
Sariah, Nephi, and Sam partake of the
fruit, but Laman and Lemuel refuse.
About 600-592 B.c.

AND it came to pass that we had
gathered together all manner of
“seeds of every kind, both of grain
of every kind, and also of the seeds
of fruit of every kind.

2 And it came to pass that while
my father tarried in the wilderness
he spake unto us, saying: Behold, I
have “dreamed a dream; or, in other
words, I have ’seen a ‘vision.

3 And behold, because of the thing
which I have seen, I have reason to
rejoice in the Lord because of “Nephi
and also of Sam; for I have reason
to suppose that they, and also many
of their seed, will be saved.

4 But behold, “Laman and Lemuel,
I fear exceedingly because of you;
for behold, methought I saw in my
dream, a dark and dreary wilderness.

5 And it came to pass that I saw
a “man, and he was dressed in a
white "robe; and he came and stood
before me.

6 And it came to pass that he spake
unto me, and bade me follow him.

 

14

7 And it came to pass that as I
followed him | beheld myself that
I was in a dark and dreary waste.

8 And after I had traveled for the
space of many hours in darkness, I
began to pray unto the Lord that he
would have “mercy on me, accord-
ing to the multitude of his tender
mercies.

9 And it came to pass after I had
prayed unto the Lord I beheld a
large and spacious “field.

10 And it came to pass that I beheld
a “tree, whose fruit was desirable
to make one ‘happy.

11 And it came to pass that I did
go forth and partake of the “fruit
thereof; and I beheld that it was most
sweet, above all that I ever before
tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the
fruit thereof was white, to exceed
all the ’whiteness that I had ever
seen.

12 And as I partook of the fruit
thereof it filled my soul with ex-
ceedingly great “joy; wherefore, I
began to be "desirous that my family
should partake of it also; for 1 knew
that it was ‘desirable above all other
fruit.

13 And as I cast my eyes round
about, that perhaps I might discover
my family also, I beheld a “river of
water; and it ran along, and it was
near the tree of which I was par-
taking the fruit.

14 And I looked to behold from
whence it came; and I saw the head
thereof a little way off; and at the
head thereof I beheld your mother
Sariah, and Sam, and “Nephi; and
they stood as if they knew not
whither they should go.

15 And it came to pass that I

beckoned unto them; and Lalso did
say unto them with a loud voice
that they should come unto me, and
partake of the fruit, which was de-
sirable above all other fruit.

16 And it came to pass that they
did come unto me and partake of
the fruit also.

17 And it came to pass that I was
desirous that Laman and Lemuel
should come and partake of the
fruit also; wherefore, I cast mine
eyes towards the head of the river,
that perhaps I might see them.

18 And it came to pass that I saw
them, but they would “not come
unto me and partake of the fruit.

19 And I beheld a 2rod of iron, and
it extended along the bank of the
river, and led to the tree by which
I stood.

20 And Lalso beheld a 4strait and
narrow path, which came along by
the rod of iron, even to the tree by
which I stood; and it also led by the
head of the fountain, unto a large
and spacious field, as if it had been
a ’world.

21 And I saw numberless con-
courses of people, many of whom
were “pressing forward, that they
might obtain the "path which led
unto the tree by which I stood.

22 And it came to pass that they
did come forth, and commence in
the path which led to the tree.

23 And it came to pass that there
arose a“mist of darkness; yea, even
an exceedingly great mist of dark-
ness, insomuch that they who had
commenced in the path did lose their

 

1 NEPHI 8:16-30

way, that they wandered off and
were “lost.

24 And it came to pass that I be-
held others pressing forward, and
they came forth and caught hold of
the end of the rod of iron; and they
did press forward through the mist
of darkness, “clinging to the rod of
iron, even until they did come forth
and partake of the "fruit of the tree.

25 And after they had partaken of
the fruit of the tree they did cast
their eyes about as if they were
“ashamed.

26 And | also cast my eyes round
about, and beheld, on the “other
side of the river of water, a great
and 'spacious building; and it stood
as it were in the ‘air, high above
the earth.

27 And it was filled with people,
both old and young, both male and
female; and their manner of dress
was exceedingly fine; and they
were in the “attitude of "mocking
and pointing their fingers towards
those who had come at and were
partaking of the fruit.

28 And after they had “tasted of
the fruit they were "ashamed, be-
cause of those that were ‘scoffing
at them; and they “fell away into
forbidden paths and were lost.

29 And now I, Nephi, do not speak
“all the words of my father.

30 But, to be short in writing,
behold, he saw other multitudes
pressing forward; and they came
and caught hold of the end of the
*rod of iron; and they did press their
way forward, continually holding

fast to the rod of iron, until they
came forth and fell down and par-
took of the fruit of the tree.

31 And he also saw other “mul-
titudes feeling their way towards
that great and spacious building.

32 And it came to pass that many
were drowned in the “depths of
the *fountain; and many were lost
from his view, wandering in strange
roads.

33 And great was the multitude
that did enter into that strange
building. And after they did enter
into that building they did point
the finger of “scorn at me and
those that were partaking of the
fruit also; but we heeded them not.

34 These are the words of my
father: For as many as “heeded
them, had fallen away.

35 And “Laman and Lemuel par-
took not of the fruit, said my
father.

36 And it came to pass after my
father had spoken all the words of
his dream or vision, which were
many, he said unto us, because
of these things which he saw ina
vision, he exceedingly feared for
Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared
lest they should be cast off from
the presence of the Lord.

37 And he did “exhort them then
with all the feeling of a tender par-
ent, that they would hearken to his
words, that perhaps the Lord would
be merciful to them, and not cast
them off; yea, my father did preach
unto them.

38 And after he had preached
unto them, and also prophesied unto
them of many things, he bade them

 

16

to keep the commandments of the
Lord; and he did cease speaking
unto them.

CHAPTER 9

Nephi makes two sets of records—Each
is called the plates of Nephi—The larger
plates contain a secular history; the
smaller ones deal primarily with sacred
things. About 600-592 B.c.

AND all these things did my father
see, and hear, and speak, as he dwelt
in a tent, in the ¢valley of Lemuel,
and also a great many more things,
which cannot be written upon these
plates.

2 And now, as I have spoken con-
cerning these plates, behold they
are not the plates upon which I
make a full account of the history
of my people; for the “plates upon
which I make a full account of my
people I have given the name of
Nephi; wherefore, they are called
the plates of Nephi, after mine own
name; and these plates also are
called the plates of Nephi.

3 Nevertheless, I have received a
commandment of the Lord that I
should make these plates, for the
special “purpose that there should
be an account engraven of the ’min-
istry of my people.

4 Upon the other plates should be
engraven an account of the reign
of the kings, and the wars and con-
tentions of my people; wherefore
these plates are for the more part of
the ministry; and the “other plates
are for the more part of the reign
of the kings and the wars and con-
tentions of my people.

5 Wherefore, the Lord hath com-
manded me to make these plates
for a “wise purpose in him, which
purpose I know not.

6 But the Lord *knoweth all things
from the beginning; wherefore, he
prepareth a way to accomplish all
his works among the children of
men; for behold, he hath all *power
unto the fulfilling of all his words.
And thus it is. Amen.

CHAPTER 10

Lehi predicts that the Jews will be taken
captive by the Babylonians—He tells of
the coming among the Jews of a Mes-
siah, a Savior, a Redeemer—Lehi tells
also of the coming of the one who should
baptize the Lamb of God—Lehi tells of
the death and resurrection of the Mes-
siah—He compares the scattering and
gathering of Israel to an olive tree—
Nephi speaks of the Son of God, of the
gift of the Holy Ghost, and of the need
for righteousness. About 600-592 B.c.

AND now I, Nephi, proceed to give
an account upon “these plates of
my proceedings, and my reign and
ministry; wherefore, to proceed with
mine account, I must speak some-
what of the things of my father,
and also of my brethren.

2 For behold, it came to pass af-
ter my father had made an end of
speaking the words of his “dream,
and also of exhorting them to all
diligence, he spake unto them con-
cerning the Jews—

 

1 NEPHI 9:5-10:9

3 That after they should be de-
stroyed, even that great city “Jeru-
salem, and many be carried away
captive into “Babylon, according to
the own due time of the Lord, they
should “return again, yea, even be
brought back out of captivity; and
after they should be brought back
out of captivity they should possess
again the land of their inheritance.

4 Yea, even “six hundred years
from the time that my father left
Jerusalem, a "prophet would the
Lord God raise up among the ‘Jews—
even a “Messiah, or, in other words,
a Savior of the world.

5 And he also spake concerning the
prophets, how great a number had
“testified of these things, concerning
this Messiah, of whom he had spo-
ken, or this Redeemer of the world.

6 Wherefore, all mankind were ina
“lost and ina °fallen state, and ever
would be save they should rely on
this Redeemer.

7 And he spake also concerning a
“prophet who should come before
the Messiah, to prepare the way of
the Lord—

8 Yea, even he should go forth and
cry in the wilderness: “Prepare ye
the way of the Lord, and make his
paths straight; for there standeth
one among you whom ye know not;
and he is mightier than I, whose
shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to
unloose. And much spake my father
concerning this thing.

9 And my father said he should

baptize in *“Bethabara, beyond
Jordan; and he also said he should
’baptize with water; even that he
should baptize the Messiah with
water.

10 And after he had baptized the
Messiah with water, he should be-
hold and bear record that he had
baptized the “Lamb of God, who
should take away the sins of the
world.

11 And it came to pass after my
father had spoken these words he
spake unto my brethren concern-
ing the gospel which should be
preached among the Jews, and also
concerning the “dwindling of the
Jews in unbelief. And after they
had ‘slain the Messiah, who should
come, and after he had been slain
he should “rise from the dead, and
should make himself “manifest, by
the Holy Ghost, unto the Gentiles.

12 Yea, even my father spake much
concerning the Gentiles, and also
concerning the house of Israel, that
they should be compared like unto
an “olive tree, whose "branches
should be broken off and should
be ‘scattered upon all the face of
the earth.

13 Wherefore, he said it must needs
be that we should be led with one
accord into the “land of promise,
unto the fulfilling of the word of
the Lord, that we should be scat-
tered upon all the face of the earth.

 

18

14 And after the house of Israel
should be scattered they should be
beathered together again; or, in fine,
after the ‘Gentiles had received the
fulness of the “Gospel, the natural
branches of the “olive tree, or the
fremnants of the house of ¢Israel,
should be grafted in, or "come to the
knowledge of the true Messiah, their
Lord and their Redeemer.

15 And after this manner of lan-
guage did my father prophesy
and speak unto my brethren, and
also many more things which I do
not write in this book; for I have
written as many of them as were
expedient for me in mine “other
book.

16 And all these things, of which
I have spoken, were done as my
father dwelt in a “tent, in the val-
ley of Lemuel.

17 And it came to pass after I,
Nephi, having heard all the “words
of my father, concerning the things
which he saw in a °vision, and also
the things which he spake by the
power of the Holy Ghost, which
power he received by faith on the
Son of God—and the Son of God was
the “Messiah who should come—I,
Nephi, was ‘desirous also that I
might see, and hear, and know of
these things, by the power of the
‘Holy Ghost, which is the ‘gift of
God unto fall those who diligently
seek him, as well in times of “old

as in the time that he should mani-
fest himself unto the children of
men.

18 For he is the “same yesterday,
today, and forever; and the way is
prepared for all men from the foun-
dation of the world, if it so be that
they repent and come unto him.

19 For he that diligently “seeketh
shall find; and the "mysteries of God
shall be unfolded unto them, by the
power of the ‘Holy Ghost, as wellin
these times as in times of old, and
as well in times of old as in times
to come; wherefore, the ‘course of
the Lord is one eternal round.

20 Therefore remember, O man,
for all thy doings thou shalt be
brought into “judgment.

21 Wherefore, if ye have sought
to do “wickedly in the days of your
’probation, then ye are found ‘un-
clean before the judgment-seat of
God; and no unclean thing can dwell
with God; wherefore, ye must be
cast off forever.

22 And the Holy Ghost giveth “au-
thority that I should speak these
things, and deny them not.

CHAPTER 11

Nephi sees the Spirit of the Lord and
is shown in vision the tree of life—He
sees the mother of the Son of God and
learns of the condescension of God—He
sees the baptism, ministry, and cruci-
fixion of the Lamb of God—He sees
also the call and ministry of the Twelve

1 NEPHI 10:18-11:8

For it came to pass after I had de-
sired to know the things that my
father had seen, and believing that
the Lord was able to make them
known unto me, as I sat “pondering
in mine heart I was ’caught away in
the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an
exceedingly high ‘mountain, which
I never had before seen, and upon
which I never had before set my foot.

2 And the Spirit said unto me: Be-
hold, what “desirest thou?

3 And I said: I desire to behold
the things which my father “saw.

4 And the Spirit said unto me:
*Believest thou that thy father saw
the *tree of which he hath spoken?

5 And I said: Yea, thou knowest
that I “believe all the words of my
father.

6 And when I had spoken these
words, the Spirit cried with a loud
voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord,
the most high God; for he is God
over all the “earth, yea, even above
all. And blessed art thou, Nephi,
because thou "believest in the Son
of the most high God; wherefore,
thou shalt behold the things which
thou hast desired.

7 And behold this thing shall be
given unto thee for a “sign, that af-
ter thou hast beheld the tree which
bore the fruit which thy father
tasted, thou shalt also behold a man
descending out of heaven, and him
shall ye witness; and after ye have
witnessed him ye shall "bear record
that it is the Son of God.

8 And it came to pass that the
Spirit said unto me: Look! And I

looked and beheld a tree; and it was
like unto the “tree which my father
had seen; and the "beauty thereof
was far beyond, yea, exceeding
of all beauty; and the ‘whiteness
thereof did exceed the whiteness
of the driven snow.

9 And it came to pass after I had
seen the tree, I said unto the Spirit:
I behold thou hast shown unto me
the tree which is “precious above all.

10 And he said unto me: What
desirest thou?

11 And I said unto him: To know
the “interpretation thereof—for I
spake unto him as a man speak-
eth; for I beheld that he was in the
’form of a man; yet nevertheless, I
knew that it was the Spirit of the
Lord; and he spake unto me asa
man speaketh with another.

12 And it came to pass that he said
unto me: Look! And I looked as if to
look upon him, and I saw him not; for
he had gone from before my presence.

13 And it came to pass that I
looked and beheld the great city of
Jerusalem, and also other cities, And
I beheld the city of Nazareth; and
in the city of *Nazareth I beheld a
’virgin, and she was exceedingly
fair and white.

14 And it came to pass that I saw
the “heavens open; and an angel
came down and stood before me;
and he said unto me: Nephi, what
beholdest thou?

15 And I said unto him: A virgin,
most beautiful and fair above all
other virgins.

16 And he said unto me: Knowest
thou the “condescension of God?

 

20

17 And I said unto him: I know
that he loveth his children; never-
theless, I do not know the meaning
of all things.

18 And he said unto me: Behold,
the “virgin whom thou seest is the
’mother of the Son of God, after the
manner of the flesh.

19 And it came to pass that I be-
held that she was carried away in
the Spirit; and after she had been
carried away in the “Spirit for the
space of a time the angel spake unto
me, saying: Look!

20 And I looked and beheld the
virgin again, bearing a “child in
her arms.

21 And the angel said unto me:
Behold the “Lamb of God, yea, even
the °Son of the Eternal ‘Father!
Knowest thou the meaning of the
“tree which thy father saw?

22 And I answered him, saying:
Yea, it is the “love of God, which
’sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts
of the children of men; wherefore,
it is the ‘most desirable above all
things.

23 And he spake unto me, saying:
Yea, and the most “joyous to the
soul,

24 And after he had said these
words, he said unto me: Look! And I
looked, and I beheld the Son of God
“going forth among the children of
men; and I saw many fall down at
his feet and worship him.

25 And it came to pass that I beheld
that the “rod of iron, which my
father had seen, was the °word of
God, which ‘led to the fountain of
“living waters, or to the ‘tree of life;

which waters are a representation
of the love of God; and L also beheld
that the tree of life was a represen-
tation of the love of God.

26 And the angel said unto me
again: Look and behold the ¢con-
descension of God!

27 And I looked and “beheld the
Redeemer of the world, of whom
my father had spoken; and I also
beheld the "prophet who should
prepare the way before him. And
the Lamb of God went forth and
was ‘baptized of him; and after
he was baptized, I beheld the heav-
ens open, and the Holy Ghost come
down out of heaven and abide upon
him in the form of a “dove.

28 And I beheld that he went
forth ministering unto the people,
in “power and great glory; and the
multitudes were gathered together
to hear him; and I beheld that they
cast him out from among them.

29 And I also beheld “twelve oth-
ers following him. And it came to
pass that they were ’carried away
in the Spirit from before my face,
and I saw them not.

30 And it came to pass that the
angel spake unto me again, saying:
Look! And I looked, and I beheld
the heavens open again, and I saw
“angels descending upon the chil-
dren of men; and they did minister
unto them.

31 And he spake unto me again,
saying: Look! And I looked, and I
beheld the Lamb of God going forth
among the children of men. And I
beheld multitudes of people who

 

1 NEPHI 11:26-36

were ‘sick, and who were afflicted
with all manner of diseases, and
with ’devils and ‘unclean spirits;
and the angel spake and showed
all these things unto me. And they
were “healed by the power of the
Lamb of God; and the devils and
the unclean spirits were cast out.

32 And it came to pass that the
angel spake unto me again, saying:
Look! And I looked and beheld the
Lamb of God, that he was “taken
by the people; yea, the Son of the
everlasting God was judged of the
world; and I saw and bear record.

33 And I, Nephi, saw that he was
“lifted up upon the cross and ’slain
for the sins of the world.

34 And after he was slain I saw the
multitudes of the earth, that they
were gathered together to “fight
against the apostles of the Lamb;
for thus were the twelve called by
the angel of the Lord.

35 And the multitude of the earth
was gathered together; and I be-
held that they were in a large and
spacious “building, like unto the
building which my father saw. And
the angel of the Lord spake unto
me again, saying: Behold the world
and the wisdom thereof; yea, behold
the house of Israel hath gathered
together to *fight against the twelve
apostles of the Lamb.

36 And it came to pass that I saw
and bear record, that the great and
spacious building was the “pride of
the world; and it °fell, and the fall
thereof was exceedingly great. And

of the Lamb.

CHAPTER 12

Nephi sees in vision the land of promise;
the righteousness, iniquity, and down-
fall of its inhabitants; the coming of
the Lamb of God among them; how the
Twelve Disciples and the Twelve Apos-
tles will judge Israel; and the loathsome
and filthy state of those who dwindle
in unbelief. About 600-592 B.c.

AND it came to pass that the angel
said unto me: Look, and behold
thy seed, and also the seed of thy
brethren, And I looked and beheld
the “land of promise; and I beheld
multitudes of people, yea, even as
it were in number as many as the
’sand of the sea.

2 And it came to pass that I beheld
multitudes gathered together to
battle, one against the other; and I
beheld “wars, and rumors of wars,
and great slaughters with the sword
among my people.

3 And it came to pass that I be-
held many generations pass away,
after the manner of wars and con-
tentions in the land; and I beheld
many cities, yea, even that I did not
number them.

4 And it came to pass that I saw
a *mist of "darkness on the face
of the land of promise; and I saw
lightnings, and I heard thunderings,
and earthquakes, and all manner of
tumultuous noises; and I saw the
earth and the rocks, that they rent;
and Isaw mountains tumbling into

 

22

pieces; and I saw the plains of the
earth, that they were ‘broken up;
and Isaw many cities that they were
4sunk; and I saw many that they
were burned with fire; and I saw
many that did tumble to the earth,
because of the quaking thereof.

5 And it came to pass after I saw
these things, I saw the “vapor of
darkness, that it passed from off
the face of the earth; and behold, I
saw multitudes who had not fallen
because of the great and terrible
judgments of the Lord.

6 And I saw the heavens open, and
the “Lamb of God descending out
of heaven; and he came down and
’showed himself unto them.

7 And I also saw and bear record
that the Holy Ghost fell upon “twelve
others; and they were ordained of
God, and chosen,

8 And the angel spake unto me,
saying: Behold the twelve disci-
ples of the Lamb, who are chosen
to minister unto thy seed.

9 And he said unto me: Thou
rememberest the “twelve apostles
of the Lamb? Behold they are they
who shall "judge the twelve tribes
of Israel; wherefore, the twelve
ministers of thy seed shall be judged
of them; for ye are of the house of
Israel.

10 And these “twelve ministers
whom thou beholdest shall judge
thy seed. And, behold, they are
righteous forever; for because of
their faith in the Lamb of God their
b’earments are made white in his
blood.

11 And the angel said unto me:
Look! And I looked, and beheld

righteousness; and their garments
were white even like unto the Lamb
of God. And the angel said unto me:
These are made white in the blood
of the Lamb, because of their faith
in him.

12 And I, Nephi, also saw many of
the “fourth generation who passed
away in righteousness.

13 And it came to pass that I saw
the multitudes of the earth gath-
ered together.

14 And the angel said unto me:
Behold thy seed, and also the seed
of thy brethren.

15 And it came to pass that I looked
and beheld the people of my seed
gathered together in multitudes
“against the seed of my brethren;
and they were gathered together
to battle.

16 And the angel spake unto me,
saying: Behold the fountain of
“filthy water which thy father saw;
yea, even the ’river of which he
spake; and the depths thereof are
the depths of ‘hell.

17 And the “mists of darkness are
the temptations of the devil, which
’blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth
the hearts of the children of men,
and leadeth them away into ‘broad
roads, that they perish and are lost.

18 And the large and spacious
*building, which thy father saw, is
vain “imaginations and the ‘pride
of the children of men. And a great
and a terrible “gulf divideth them;
yea, even the word of the ‘justice of
the Eternal God, and the Messiah
who is the Lamb of God, of whom
the Holy Ghost beareth record,
from the beginning of the world

 

1 NEPHI 12:12-23

until this time, and from this time
henceforth and forever.

19 And while the angel spake
these words, I beheld and saw that
the seed of my brethren did con-
tend against my seed, according to
the word of the angel; and because
of the pride of my seed, and the
“temptations of the devil, I beheld
that the seed of my brethren did
overpower the people of my seed.

20 And it came to pass that I be-
held, and saw the people of the
seed of my brethren that they had
overcome my seed; and they went
forth in multitudes upon the face
of the land.

21 And I saw them gathered to-
gether in multitudes; and I saw “wars
and rumors of wars among them;
and in wars and rumors of wars I
saw many generations pass away.

22 And the angel said unto me:
Behold these shall *dwindle in
unbelief.

23 And it came to pass that I be-
held, after they had dwindled in
unbelief they became a “dark, and
loathsome, and a ’filthy people,
full of ‘idleness and all manner of
abominations.

CHAPTER 13

Nephi sees in vision the church of the
devil set up among the Gentiles, the
discovery and colonizing of America,
the loss of many plain and precious
parts of the Bible, the resultant state
of gentile apostasy, the restoration of
the gospel, the coming forth of latter-
day scripture, and the building up of
Zion. About 600-592 B.c.

AND it came to pass that the angel
spake unto me, saying: Look! And
I looked and beheld many nations
and kingdoms.

2 And the angel said unto me: What
beholdest thou? And I said: I behold
many “nations and kingdoms.

3 And he said unto me: These are
the nations and kingdoms of the
Gentiles.

4 And it came to pass that I saw
among the nations of the “Gentiles
the formation of a °great church.

5 And the angel said unto me:
Behold the formation of a “church
which is most abominable above
all other churches, which ’slayeth
the saints of God, yea, and tortureth
them and bindeth them down, and
yoketh them with a ‘yoke of iron, and
bringeth them down into captivity.

6 And it came to pass that I beheld
this “great and "abominable church;
and I saw the ‘devil that he was the
founder of it.

7 And L also saw “gold, and silver,
and silks, and scarlets, and fine-
twined "linen, and all manner of
precious clothing; and I saw many
harlots.

8 And the angel spake unto me,
saying: Behold the gold, and the
silver, and the silks, and the scarlets,
and the fine-twined linen, and the
precious clothing, and the harlots,
are the “desires of this great and
abominable church.

9 And also for the “praise of the
world do they "destroy the saints
of God, and bring them down into
captivity.

10 And it came to pass that I looked
and beheld many waters; and they

 

24

divided the Gentiles from the seed
of my brethren.

11 And it came to pass that the
angel said unto me: Behold the
wrath of God is upon the seed of
thy brethren.

12 And I looked and beheld a man
among the Gentiles, who was sepa-
rated from the seed of my brethren
by the many waters; and I beheld
the Spirit of God, that it came down
and “wrought upon the man; and he
went forth upon the many waters,
even unto the seed of my brethren,
who were in the promised land.

13 And it came to pass that I beheld
the Spirit of God, that it wrought
upon other Gentiles; and they went
forth out of captivity, upon the
many waters.

14 And it came to pass that I beheld
many “multitudes of the Gentiles
upon the "land of promise; and I
beheld the wrath of God, that it
was upon the seed of my brethren;
and they were ‘scattered before the
Gentiles and were smitten.

15 And I beheld the Spirit of the
Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles,
and they did prosper and “obtain
the *land for their inheritance; and
I beheld that they were white, and
exceedingly fair and ‘beautiful,
like unto my people before they
were ‘slain.

16 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles
who had gone forth out of captiv-
ity did humble themselves before
the Lord; and the power of the Lord
was “with them.

17 And I beheld that their mother
Gentiles were gathered together

upon the waters, and upon the land
also, to battle against them.

18 And I beheld that the power
of God was with them, and also
that the wrath of God was upon all
those that were gathered together
“against them to battle.

19 And I, Nephi, beheld that the
Gentiles that had gone out of cap-
tivity were “delivered by the power
of God out of the hands of all other
nations.

20 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,
beheld that they did prosper in
the land; and I beheld a “book, and
it was carried forth among them.

21 And the angel said unto me:
Knowest thou the meaning of the
book?

22 And I said unto him: I know not.

23 And he said: Behold it pro-
ceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew.
And I, Nephi, beheld it; and he
said unto me: The “book that thou
beholdest is a "record of the ‘Jews,
which contains the covenants of
the Lord, which he hath made unto
the house of Israel; and it also con-
taineth many of the prophecies of
the holy prophets; and it is a record
like unto the engravings which are
upon the “plates of brass, save there
are not so many; nevertheless, they
contain the covenants of the Lord,
which he hath made unto the house
of Israel; wherefore, they are of great
worth unto the Gentiles.

24 And the angel of the Lord said
unto me: Thou hast beheld that the
“book proceeded forth from the
mouth of a Jew; and when it pro-
ceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew
it contained the fulness of the gospel

 

1 NEPHI 13:18-29

of the Lord, of whom the twelve
apostles bear record; and they bear
record according to the truth which
is in the Lamb of God.

25 Wherefore, these things go forth
from the “Jews in purity unto the
’Gentiles, according to the truth
which is in God.

26 And after they go forth by the
*hand of the twelve apostles of
the Lamb, from the Jews °unto the
Gentiles, thou seest the formation of
that ‘great and abominable ¢church,
which is most abominable above
all other churches; for behold, they
have ‘taken away from the gospel
of the Lamb many parts which are
fplain and most precious; and also
many covenants of the Lord have
they taken away.

27 And all this have they done that
they might pervert the right ways
of the Lord, that they might blind
the eyes and harden the hearts of
the children of men.

28 Wherefore, thou seest that after
the book hath gone forth through
the hands of the great and abomi-
nable church, that there are many
plain and “precious things taken
away from the book, which is the
book of the Lamb of God.

29 And after these plain and pre-
cious things were “taken away it
goeth forth unto all the nations of
the Gentiles; and after it goeth forth
unto all the nations of the Gentiles,
yea, even across the many waters
which thou hast seen with the Gen-
tiles which have gone forth out of
captivity, thou seest—because of
the many plain and precious things
which have been taken out of the

book, which were plain unto the un-
derstanding of the children of men,
according to the plainness which
is in the Lamb of God—because of
these things which are taken away
out of the gospel of the Lamb, an
exceedingly great many do stum-
ble, yea, insomuch that Satan hath
great power over them.

30 Nevertheless, thou beholdest
that the Gentiles who have gone
forth out of captivity, and have been
lifted up by the power of God above
all other nations, upon the face of
the land which is choice above all
other lands, which is the land that
the Lord God hath covenanted with
thy father that his seed should have
for the “land of their inheritance;
wherefore, thou seest that the Lord
God will not suffer that the Gentiles
will utterly destroy the 'mixture
of thy ‘seed, which are among thy
brethren.

31 Neither will he suffer that the
Gentiles shall “destroy the seed of
thy brethren.

32 Neither will the Lord God suf-
fer that the Gentiles shall forever
remain in that awful state of blind-
ness, which thou beholdest they are
in, because of the plain and most
precious parts of the gospel of the
Lamb which have been kept back
by that “abominable church, whose
formation thou hast seen.

33 Wherefore saith the Lamb of
God: I will be *merciful unto the
Gentiles, unto the visiting of the
remnant of the house of Israel in
great judgment.

 

26

34 And it came to pass that the
angel of the Lord spake unto me,
saying: Behold, saith the Lamb of
God, after I have “visited the °’rem-
nant of the house of Israel—and
this remnant of whom I speak is the
seed of thy father—wherefore, after
I have visited them in judgment,
and smitten them by the hand of
the Gentiles, and after the Gentiles
do ‘stumble exceedingly, because
of the most plain and precious
parts of the “gospel of the Lamb
which have been Kept back by that
abominable church, which is the
mother of harlots, saith the Lamb—I
will be merciful unto the “Gentiles
in that day, insomuch that I will
‘bring forth unto them, in mine own
power, much of my “gospel, which
shall be plain and precious, saith
the Lamb.

35 For, behold, saith the Lamb: I
will manifest myself unto thy seed,
that they shall write many things
which I shall minister unto them,
which shall be plain and precious;
and after thy seed shall be de-
stroyed, and dwindle in unbelief,
and also the seed of thy brethren,
behold, “these things shall be hid
up, to come forth unto the Gentiles,
by the gift and power of the Lamb.

36 And in them shall be written
my “gospel, saith the Lamb, and my
’rock and my salvation.

37 And “blessed are they who shall
seek to bring forth my °Zion at that
day, for they shall have the ‘gift and
the “power of the Holy Ghost; and

38 And it came to pass that I be-
held the remnant of the seed of my
brethren, and also the “book of the
Lamb of God, which had proceeded
forth from the mouth of the Jew,
that it came forth from the Gentiles
bunto the remnant of the seed of
my brethren.

39 And after it had come forth
unto them I beheld “other books,
which came forth by the power of
the Lamb, from the Gentiles unto
them, unto the ‘convincing of the
Gentiles and the remnant of the seed
of my brethren, and also the Jews
who were scattered upon all the
face of the earth, that the records
of the prophets and of the twelve
apostles of the Lamb are “true.

40 And the angel spake unto me,
saying: These “last records, which
thou hast seen among the Gentiles,
shall *establish the truth of the ‘first,
which are of the “twelve apostles of
the Lamb, and shall make known
the plain and precious things which
have been taken away from them;
and shall make known to all kin-
dreds, tongues, and people, that
the Lamb of God is the Son of the
Eternal Father, and the “Savior of
the world; and that all men must
come unto him, or they cannot be
saved.

1 NEPHI 13:38-14:2

41 And they must come according
to the words which shall be estab-
lished by the mouth of the Lamb;
and the words of the Lamb shall be
made known in the records of thy
seed, as well as in the “records of the
twelve apostles of the Lamb; where-
fore they both shall be established
in °one; for there is “one God and
one “Shepherd over all the earth.

42 And the time cometh that he
shall manifest himself unto all na-
tions, both unto the “Jews and also
unto the Gentiles; and after he has
manifested himself unto the Jews
and also unto the Gentiles, then
he shall manifest himself unto the
Gentiles and also unto the Jews,
and the "last shall be first, and the
‘first shall be last.

CHAPTER 14

An angel tells Nephi of the blessings and
cursings to fall upon the Gentiles—T here
are only two churches: the Church of
the Lamb of God and the church of the
devil—The Saints of God in all nations
are persecuted by the great and abomi-
nable church—The Apostle John will
write concerning the end of the world.
About 600-592 B.c.

AND it shall come to pass, that if
the “Gentiles shall hearken unto
the Lamb of God in that day that
he shall manifest himself unto them
in word, and also in "power, in very
deed, unto the ‘taking away of their
4stumbling blocks—

against the Lamb of God, they shall
be numbered among the seed of thy
father; yea, they shall be “numbered
among the house of Israel; and they
shall be a "blessed people upon the
‘promised land forever; they shall
be no more brought down into cap-
tivity; and the house of Israel shall
no more be confounded.

3 And that great “pit, which hath
been digged for them by that great
and abominable church, which
was founded by the devil and his
children, that he might lead away
the souls of men down to hell—
yea, that great pit which hath been
digged for the destruction of men
shall be filled by those who digged
it, unto their utter destruction,
saith the Lamb of God; not the de-
struction of the soul, save it be the
casting of it into that "hell which
hath no end.

4 For behold, this is according to
the “captivity of the devil, and also
according to the justice of God, upon
all those who will work wickedness
and abomination before him.

5 And it came to pass that the an-
gel spake unto me, Nephi, saying:
Thou hast beheld that if the Gentiles
repent it shall be well with them;
and thou also knowest concerning
the covenants of the Lord unto the
house of Israel; and thou also hast
heard that whoso ’repenteth not
must perish.

6 Therefore, *wo be unto the
Gentiles if it so be that they harden

 

28

their hearts against the Lamb of
God.

7 For the time cometh, saith the
Lamb of God, that I will work a
great and a “marvelous work among
the children of men; a ’work which
shall be everlasting, either on the
one hand or on the other—either
to the convincing of them unto
“peace and “life eternal, or unto the
deliverance of them to the hardness
of their hearts and the blindness of
their minds unto their being brought
down into captivity, and also into
destruction, both temporally and
spiritually, according to the “cap-
tivity of the devil, of which I have
spoken.

8 And it came to pass that when
the angel had spoken these words,
he said unto me: Rememberest thou
the “covenants of the Father unto the
house of Israel? I said unto him, Yea.

9 And it came to pass that he said
unto me: Look, and behold that great
and abominable church, which is
the mother of abominations, whose
founder is the devil.

10 And he said unto me: Behold
there are save *two churches only;
the one is the church of the Lamb
of God, and the ’other is the church
of the ‘devil; wherefore, “~whoso
belongeth not to the church of the
Lamb of God belongeth to that
great church, which is the mother
of abominations; and she is the
‘whore of all the earth.

looked and beheld the whore of all
the earth, and she sat upon many
“waters; and she had dominion over
ball the earth, among all nations,
kindreds, tongues, and people.

12 And it came to pass that I beheld
the church of the Lamb of God, and
its numbers were “few, because of
the wickedness and abominations
of the whore who sat upon many
waters; nevertheless, I beheld that
the church of the Lamb, who were
the saints of God, were also upon
ball the face of the earth; and their
dominions upon the face of the earth
were small, because of the wicked-
ness of the great whore whom I saw.

13 And it came to pass that I beheld
that the great mother of abomina-
tions did gather together multitudes
upon the face of all the earth, among
all the nations of the Gentiles, to
“fight against the Lamb of God.

14 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, beheld the power of the
Lamb of God, that it descended upon
the saints of the church of the Lamb,
and upon the covenant people of
the Lord, who were scattered upon
all the face of the earth; and they
were “armed with °righteousness
and with the ‘power of God in great
glory.

15 And it came to pass that I beheld
that the wrath of God was “poured
out upon that great and abominable
church, insomuch that there were
wars and rumors of wars among
all the ’nations and kindreds of
the earth.

16 And as there began to be wars
and rumors of wars among all the

 

1 NEPHI 14:12-23

nations which belonged to the
mother of abominations, the angel
spake unto me, saying: Behold, the
wrath of God is upon the mother
of harlots; and behold, thou seest
all these things—

17 And when the “day cometh
that the ’wrath of God is poured
out upon the mother of harlots,
which is the great and abomina-
ble church of all the earth, whose
founder is the devil, then, at that
day, the ‘work of the Father shall
commence, in preparing the way
for the fulfilling of his “covenants,
which he hath made to his people
who are of the house of Israel.

18 And it came to pass that the
angel spake unto me, saying: Look!

19 And I looked and beheld a man,
and he was dressed in a white robe.

20 And the angel said unto me:
Behold “one of the twelve apostles
of the Lamb.

21 Behold, he shall ¢see and ’write
the ‘remainder of these things; yea,
and also many things which have
been.

22 And he shall also write con-
cerning the end of the world.

23 Wherefore, the things which
he shall write are just and true;
and behold they are written in the
“book which thou beheld proceed-
ing out of the mouth of the Jew;
and at the time they proceeded out
of the mouth of the Jew, or, at the
time the book proceeded out of the
mouth of the Jew, the things which
were written were plain and pure,
and most ’precious and easy to the
understanding of all men.

24 And behold, the things which
this “apostle of the Lamb shall write
are many things which thou hast
seen; and behold, the remainder
shalt thou see.

25 But the things which thou shalt
see hereafter thou shalt not write;
for the Lord God hath ordained the
apostle of the Lamb of God that he
should ¢write them.

26 And also others who have been,
to them hath he shown all things,
and they have “written them; and
they are "sealed up to come forth in
their purity, according to the truth
which is in the Lamb, in the own
due time of the Lord, unto the house
of Israel.

27 And I, Nephi, heard and bear
record, that the name of the apostle
of the Lamb was “John, according
to the word of the angel.

28 And behold, I, Nephi, am for-
bidden that I should write the re-
mainder of the things which I saw
and heard; wherefore the things
which I have written sufficeth me;
and I have written but a small part
of the things which I saw.

29 And I bear record that I saw
the things which my “father saw,
and the angel of the Lord did make
them known unto me.

30 And now I make an end of
speaking concerning the things
which I saw while I was “carried
away in the Spirit; and if all the
things which I saw are not written,
the things which I have written are
’true. And thus it is. Amen.

CHAPTER 15

Lehi’s seed are to receive the gospel from
the Gentiles in the latter days—The
gathering of Israel is likened unto an

 

30

olive tree whose natural branches will be
grafted in again—Nephi interprets the
vision of the tree of life and speaks of
the justice of God in dividing the wicked
from the righteous. About 600-592 B.c.

AND it came to pass that after I,
Nephi, had been carried away in
the Spirit, and seen all these things,
I returned to the tent of my father.

2 And it came to pass that I beheld
my brethren, and they were disput-
ing one with another concerning
the things which my father had
spoken unto them.

3 For he truly spake many great
things unto them, which were hard
to be “understood, save a man should
inquire of the Lord; and they be-
ing hard in their hearts, therefore
they did not look unto the Lord as
they ought.

4 And now I, Nephi, was grieved
because of the hardness of their
hearts, and also, because of the
things which I had seen, and knew
they must unavoidably come to
pass because of the great wicked-
ness of the children of men.

5 And it came to pass that I was
overcome because of my afflictions,
for I considered that mine afflic-
tions were great above all, because
of the "destruction of my people,
for I had beheld their fall.

6 And it came to pass that after I
had received ‘strength I spake unto
my brethren, desiring to know of
them the cause of their disputations.

7 And they said: Behold, we cannot
understand the words which our
father hath spoken concerning the
natural branches of the “olive tree,
and also concerning the Gentiles.

8 And I said unto them: Have ye
“inquired of the Lord?

9 And they said unto me: “We have
not; for the Lord maketh no such
thing known unto us.

10 Behold, I said unto them: How
is it that ye do not keep the com-
mandments of the Lord? How is it
that ye will *perish, because of the
hardness of your hearts?

11 Do ye not remember the things
which the Lord hath said?—If ye
will not harden your hearts, and
“ask me in "faith, believing that
ye shall receive, with diligence in
keeping my commandments, surely
these things shall be made known
unto you.

12 Behold, I say unto you, that the
house of Israel was compared unto
an olive tree, by the Spirit of the
Lord which was in our father; and
behold are we not broken off from
the house of Israel, and are we not
a “branch of the house of Israel?

13 And now, the thing which our
father meaneth concerning the
grafting in of the natural branches
through the fulness of the Gentiles,
is, that in the latter days, when our
seed shall have “dwindled in un-
belief, yea, for the space of many
years, and many generations after
the ’Messiah shall be manifested
in body unto the children of men,
then shall the fulness of the ‘gospel
of the Messiah come unto the Gen-
tiles, and from the ¢Gentiles unto
the remnant of our seed—

14 And at that day shall the rem-
nant of our “seed ’know that they
are of the house of Israel, and that
they are the ‘covenant people of the
Lord; and then shall they know and

 

1 NEPHI 15:9-18

4come to the ‘knowledge of their
forefathers, and also to the knowl-
edge of the gospel of their Redeemer,
which was ministered unto their
fathers by him; wherefore, they shall
come to the knowledge of their Re-
deemer and the very points of his
doctrine, that they may know how
to come unto him and be saved.

15 And then at that day will they
not rejoice and give praise unto
their everlasting God, their ¢rock
and their salvation? Yea, at that day,
will they not receive the strength
and nourishment from the true
>vine? Yea, will they not come unto
the true fold of God?

16 Behold, I say unto you, Yea;
they shall be remembered again
among the house of Israel; they
shall be “grafted in, being a natu-
ral branch of the olive tree, into
the true olive tree.

17 And this is what our father
meaneth; and he meaneth that it
will not come to pass until after
they are scattered by the Gentiles;
and he meaneth that it shall come
by way of the Gentiles, that the
Lord may show his power unto the
Gentiles, for the very cause that he
shall be “rejected of the Jews, or of
the house of Israel.

18 Wherefore, our father hath not
spoken of our seed alone, but also
of all the house of Israel, pointing
to the covenant which should be
fulfilled in the latter days; which
covenant the Lord made to our
father Abraham, saying: In thy “seed
shall all the kindreds of the earth
be ’blessed.

19 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, spake much unto them con-
cerning these things; yea, I spake
unto them concerning the “restora-
tion of the Jews in the latter days.

20 And I did rehearse unto them
the words of “Isaiah, who spake
’concerning the ‘restoration of the
Jews, or of the house of Israel; and
after they were restored they should
no more be confounded, neither
should they be scattered again.
And it came to pass that I did speak
many words unto my brethren, that
they were pacified and did “humble
themselves before the Lord.

21 And it came to pass that they
did speak unto me again, saying:
What meaneth this thing which
our father saw in a dream? What
meaneth the “tree which he saw?

22 And I said unto them: It was a
representation of the “tree of life.

23 And they said unto me: What
meaneth the “rod of iron which
our father saw, that led to the tree?

24 And I said unto them that it
was the “word of God; and whoso
would hearken unto the word of
God, and would "hold fast unto it,
they would never perish; neither
could the ‘temptations and the
fiery “darts of the ‘adversary over-
power them unto blindness, to lead
them away to destruction.

25 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort
them to give “heed unto the word
of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them
with all the energies of my soul, and
with all the *faculty which I pos-
sessed, that they would give heed
to the word of God and remember

 

32

to keep his commandments always
in all things.

26 And they said unto me: What
meaneth the “river of water which
our father saw?

27 And I said unto them that the
‘water which my father saw was
>filthiness; and so much was his
mind swallowed up in other things
that he beheld not the filthiness of
the water.

28 And I said unto them that it was
an awful “gulf, which separated the
wicked from the tree of life, and
also from the saints of God.

29 And I said unto them that it
was a representation of that awful
*hell, which the angel said unto me
was prepared for the wicked.

30 And I said unto them that
our father also saw that the “justice
of God did also divide the wicked
from the righteous; and the bright-
ness thereof was like unto the
brightness of a flaming ’fire, which
ascendeth up unto God forever and
ever, and hath no end.

31 And they said unto me: Doth
this thing mean the torment of the
body in the days of “probation, or
doth it mean the final state of the
soul after the "death of the temporal
body, or doth it speak of the things
which are temporal?

32 And it came to pass that I said
unto them that it was a represen-
tation of things both temporal and
spiritual; for the day should come
that they must be judged of their
“works, yea, even the works which
were done by the temporal body in
their days of *probation.

33 Wherefore, if they should @die
in their wickedness they must be
cast off also, as to the things which
are spiritual, which are pertaining
to righteousness; wherefore, they
must be brought to stand before
God, to be ‘judged of their “works;
and if their works have been filthi-
ness they must needs be ‘filthy; and
if they be filthy it must needs be
that they cannot ‘dwell in the king-
dom of God; if so, the kingdom of
God must be filthy also.

34 But behold, I say unto you, the
kingdom of God is not filthy, and
there cannot any unclean thing
enter into the kingdom of God;
wherefore there must needs be a
place of “filthiness prepared for
that which is filthy.

35 And there is a place prepared,
yea, even that awful "hell of which
I have spoken, and the ‘devil is the
preparator of it; wherefore the fi-
nal state of the souls of men is to
dwell in the kingdom of God, or to
be cast out because of that “justice
of which I have spoken.

36 Wherefore, the wicked are re-
jected from the righteous, and also
from that “tree of life, whose fruit is
most precious and most *desirable
above all other fruits; yea, and it is
the ‘greatest of all the “gifts of God.
And thus I spake unto my brethren.
Amen.

CHAPTER 16

The wicked take the truth to be hard—
Lehi’s sons marry the daughters of

 

1 NEPHI 15:33-16:6

Ishmael—The Liahona guides their
course in the wilderness—Messages
from the Lord are written on the Lia-
hona from time to time—Ishmael dies;
his family murmurs because of afflic-
tions. About 600-592 B.c.

AND now it came to pass that after I,
Nephi, had made an end of speaking
to my brethren, behold they said
unto me: Thou hast declared unto
us hard things, more than we are
able to bear.

2 And it came to pass that I said
unto them that I knew that I had
spoken “hard things against the
wicked, according to the truth;
and the righteous have I justified,
and testified that they should be
lifted up at the last day; where-
fore, the "guilty taketh the ‘truth
to be hard, for it ¢cutteth them to
the very center.

3 And now my brethren, if ye
were righteous and were willing to
hearken to the truth, and give heed
unto it, that ye might “walk up-
rightly before God, then ye would
not murmur because of the truth,
and say: Thou speakest hard things
against us.

4 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,
did exhort my brethren, with all
diligence, to keep the command-
ments of the Lord.

5 And it came to pass that they
did “humble themselves before the
Lord; insomuch that I had joy and
great hopes of them, that they would
walk in the paths of righteousness.

and done as my father dwelt ina
tent in the “valley which he called
Lemuel.

7 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, took one of the “daughters of
Ishmael to ’wife; and also, my
brethren took of the ‘daughters of
Ishmael to wife; and also ¢Zoram
took the eldest daughter of Ishmael
to wife.

8 And thus my father had fulfilled
all the “commandments of the Lord
which had been given unto him.
And also, I, Nephi, had been blessed
of the Lord exceedingly.

9 And it came to pass that the voice
of the Lord spake unto my father
by night, and commanded him that
on the morrow he should take his
journey into the wilderness.

10 And it came to pass that as my
father arose in the morning, and
went forth to the tent door, to his
great astonishment he beheld upon
the ground a round “ball of curious
workmanship; and it was of fine
brass. And within the ball were two
spindles; and the one pointed the
way whither we should go into the
wilderness.

11 And it came to pass that we did
gather together whatsoever things
we should carry into the wilderness,
and all the remainder of our pro-
visions which the Lord had given
unto us; and we did take ‘seed of
every kind that we might carry into
the wilderness.

12 And it came to pass that we did
take our tents and depart into the
wilderness, across the river Laman.

13 And it came to pass that we
traveled for the space of four days,
nearly a south-southeast direction,
and we did pitch our tents again; and
we did call the name of the place
*Shazer.

 

34

14 And it came to pass that we did
take our bows and our arrows, and
go forth into the wilderness to slay
food for our families; and after we
had slain food for our families we
did return again to our families
in the wilderness, to the place of
Shazer. And we did go forth again
in the wilderness, following the
same direction, keeping in the
most fertile parts of the wilderness,
which were in the borders near the
*Red Sea.

15 And it came to pass that we did
travel for the space of many days,
*slaying food by the way, with our
bows and our arrows and our stones
and our slings.

16 And we did follow the direc-
tions of the ball, which led us in the
more fertile parts of the wilderness.

17 And after we had traveled for
the space of many days, we did pitch
our tents for the space of a time,
that we might again rest ourselves
and obtain food for our families.

18 And it came to pass that as I,
Nephi, went forth to slay food, be-
hold, I did break my bow, which
was made of fine “steel; and after
I did break my bow, behold, my
brethren were angry with me be-
cause of the loss of my bow, for we
did obtain no food.

19 And it came to pass that we did
return without food to our families,
and being much fatigued, because
of their journeying, they did suffer
much for the want of food.

20 And it came to pass that Laman
and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael
did begin to murmur exceedingly,
because of their sufferings and
afflictions in the wilderness; and
also my father began to murmur
against the Lord his God; yea, and
they were all exceedingly sorrowful,

even that they did “murmur against
the Lord.

21 Now it came to pass that I,
Nephi, having been afflicted with
my brethren because of the loss of
my bow, and their bows having lost
their “springs, it began to be exceed-
ingly difficult, yea, insomuch that
we could obtain no food.

22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,
did speak much unto my breth-
ren, because they had hardened
their hearts again, even unto “com-
plaining against the Lord their God.

23 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, did “make out of wood a
bow, and out of a straight stick, an
arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself
with a bow and an arrow, with a
sling and with stones. And I said
unto my °father: Whither shall 1 go
to obtain food?

24 And it came to pass that he did
“inquire of the Lord, for they had
*’humbled themselves because of
my words; for I did say many things
unto them in the energy of my soul.

25 And it came to pass that the
voice of the Lord came unto my
father; and he was truly ¢chastened
because of his murmuring against
the Lord, insomuch that he was
brought down into the depths of
sorrow.

26 And it came to pass that the
voice of the Lord said unto him:
Look upon the ball, and behold the
things which are written.

27 And it came to pass that when
my father beheld the things which
were “written upon the ball, he did
fear and tremble exceedingly, and
also my brethren and the sons of
Ishmael and our wives.

 

1 NEPHI 16:21-35

28 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,
beheld the pointers which were in
the ball, that they did work accord-
ing to the “faith and diligence and
heed which we did give unto them.

29 And there was also written
upon them a new writing, which
was plain to be read, which did give
us “understanding concerning the
ways of the Lord; and it was writ-
ten and changed from time to time,
according to the faith and diligence
which we gave unto it. And thus we
see that by "small means the Lord
can bring about great things.

30 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, did go forth up into the top
of the mountain, according to the
“directions which were given upon
the ball.

31 And it came to pass that I did
slay wild “beasts, insomuch that I
did obtain food for our families.

32 And it came to pass that I did
return to our tents, bearing the
beasts which I had slain; and now
when they beheld that I had ob-
tained “food, how great was their
joy! And it came to pass that they
did humble themselves before the
Lord, and did give thanks unto him.

33 And it came to pass that we did
again take our journey, traveling
nearly the same course as in the
beginning; and after we had trav-
eled for the space of many days we
did pitch our tents again, that we
might tarry for the space of a time.

34 And it came to pass that @Ish-
mael died, and was buried in the
place which was called "Nahom.

35 And it came to pass that the
daughters of Ishmael did “mourn
exceedingly, because of the loss of

their father, and because of their
bafflictions in the wilderness; and
they did “murmur against my father,
because he had brought them out of
the land of Jerusalem, saying: Our
father is dead; yea, and we have wan-
dered much in the wilderness, and
we have suffered much affliction,
hunger, thirst, and fatigue; and after
all these sufferings we must perish
in the wilderness with hunger.

36 And thus they did murmur
against my father, and also against
me; and they were desirous to “re-
turn again to Jerusalem.

37 And Laman said unto Lemuel
and also unto the sons of Ishmael:
Behold, let us “slay our father, and
also our brother Nephi, who has
taken it upon him to be our ’ruler
and our teacher, who are his elder
brethren.

38 Now, he says that the Lord has
talked with him, and also that ¢an-
gels have ministered unto him. But
behold, we know that he lies unto
us; and he tells us these things, and
he worketh many things by his
cunning arts, that he may deceive
our eyes, thinking, perhaps, that he
may lead us away into some strange
wilderness; and after he has led
us away, he has thought to make
himself a king and a ruler over us,
that he may do with us according
to his will and pleasure. And after
this manner did my brother Laman
’stir up their hearts to ‘anger.

39 And it came to pass that the Lord
was with us, yea, even the voice of
the Lord came and did speak many
words unto them, and did “chas-
ten them exceedingly; and after
they were chastened by the voice of
the Lord they did turn away their
anger, and did repent of their sins,

 

36

insomuch that the Lord did bless
us again with food, that we did not
perish.

CHAPTER 17

Nephi is commanded to build a ship—
His brethren oppose him—He exhorts
them by recounting the history of
God’s dealings with Israel—Nephi is
filled with the power of God—His
brethren are forbidden to touch him,
lest they wither as a dried reed. About
592-591 B.C.

AND it came to pass that we did
again take our journey in the wil-
derness; and we did travel nearly
eastward from that time forth. And
we did travel and “wade through
much affliction in the wilderness;
and our "women did bear children
in the wilderness.

2 And so great were the “blessings
of the Lord upon us, that while we
did live upon ’raw ‘meat in the wil-
derness, our women did give plenty
of suck for their children, and were
strong, yea, even like unto the men;
and they began to bear their jour-
neyings without murmurings.

3 And thus we see that the com-
mandments of God must be fulfilled.
And if it so be that the children
of men keep the commandments
of God he doth nourish them, and
“strengthen them, and provide
means whereby they can accom-
plish the thing which he has com-
manded them; wherefore, he did
’provide means for us while we did
sojourn in the wilderness.

4 And we did sojourn for the space
of many years, yea, even eight years
in the wilderness.

5 And we did come to the land
which we called “Bountiful, because

of its much fruit and also wild honey;
and all these things were prepared
of the Lord that we might not per-
ish. And we beheld the sea, which
we called Irreantum, which, being
interpreted, is many waters.

6 And it came to pass that we did
pitch our tents by the seashore;
and notwithstanding we had suf-
fered many “afflictions and much
difficulty, yea, even so much that
we cannot write them all, we were
exceedingly rejoiced when we came
to the seashore; and we called the
place Bountiful, because of its much
fruit.

7 And it came to pass that after I,
Nephi, had been in the land of Boun-
tiful for the space of many days,
the voice of the Lord came unto
me, saying: “Arise, and get thee into
the mountain. And it came to pass
that I arose and went up into the
mountain, and cried unto the Lord.

8 And it came to pass that the Lord
spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt
“construct a ship, after the ’man-
ner which I shall show thee, that I
may carry thy people across these
waters.

9 And I said: Lord, whither shall
I go that I may find ore to molten,
that Imay make “tools to construct
the ship after the manner which
thou hast shown unto me?

10 And it came to pass that the
Lord told me whither I should go
to find ore, that I might make tools.

11 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,
did make a bellows wherewith to
“blow the fire, of the skins of beasts;
and after I had made a bellows, that
I might have wherewith to blow the

 

1 NEPHI 17:6-18

fire, | did smite two stones together
that | might make fire.

12 For the Lord had not hitherto
suffered that we should make much
fire, as we journeyed in the wilder-
ness; for he said: I will make thy
food become sweet, that ye *cook
it not;

13 And I willalso be your “light in
the wilderness; and I will prepare
the way before you, if it so be that
ye shall keep my commandments;
wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall
keep my commandments ye shall
be led towards the "promised land;
and ye shall ‘know that it is by me
that ye are led.

14 Yea, and the Lord said also that:
After ye have arrived in the prom-
ised land, ye shall ¢know that I, the
Lord, am °God; and that I, the Lord,
did ‘deliver you from destruction;
yea, that I did bring you out of the
land of Jerusalem.

15 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did strive
to keep the “commandments of the
Lord, and I did *exhort my breth-
ren to faithfulness and diligence.

16 And it came to pass that I
did “make tools of the ore which
I did molten out of the rock.

17 And when my brethren saw
that I was about to “build a ship,
they began to "murmur against me,
saying: Our brother is a fool, for he
thinketh that he can build a ship;
yea, and he also thinketh that he
can cross these great waters.

18 And thus my brethren did
“complain against me, and were
desirous that they might not labor,

believe that I was instructed of
the Lord.

19 And now it came to pass that I,
Nephi, was exceedingly sorrowful
because of the hardness of their
hearts; and now when they saw that
I began to be sorrowful they were
glad in their hearts, insomuch that
they did “rejoice over me, saying:
We knew that ye could not con-
struct a ship, for we knew that ye
were lacking in judgment; where-
fore, thou canst not accomplish so
great a work.

20 And thou art like unto our
father, led away by the foolish
“imaginations of his heart; yea,
he hath led us out of the land of
Jerusalem, and we have wandered
in the wilderness for these many
years; and our women have toiled,
being big with child; and they have
borne children in the wilderness
and suffered all things, save it
were death; and it would have been
better that they had died before
they came out of Jerusalem than
to have suffered these afflictions.

21 Behold, these many years we
have suffered in the wilderness,
which time we might have enjoyed
our possessions and the land of our
inheritance; yea, and we might have
been happy.

22 And we know that the people
who were in the land of Jerusalem
were a “righteous people; for they
kept the statutes and judgments
of the Lord, and all his command-
ments, according to the law of
Moses; wherefore, we know that
they are a righteous people; and our

 

38

father hath judged them, and hath
led us away because we would
hearken unto his words; yea, and
our brother is like unto him. And
after this manner of language did
my brethren murmur and complain
against us.

23 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, spake unto them, saying: Do
ye believe that our fathers, who were
the children of Israel, would have
been led away out of the hands of
the “Egyptians if they had not heark-
ened unto the words of the Lord?

24 Yea, do ye suppose that they
would have been led out of bond-
age, if the Lord had not commanded
Moses that he should “lead them
out of bondage?

25 Now ye know that the children
of Israel were in “bondage; and
ye know that they were laden with
’tasks, which were grievous to be
borne; wherefore, ye Know that it
must needs be a good thing for
them, that they should be “brought
out of bondage.

26 Now ye know that “Moses was
commanded of the Lord to do that
great work; and ye know that by
his word the waters of the Red Sea
were divided hither and thither, and
they passed through on dry ground.

27 But ye know that the Egyptians
were “drowned in the Red Sea, who
were the armies of Pharaoh.

28 And ye also know that they were
fed with “manna in the wilderness,

29 Yea, and ye also know that
Moses, by his word according to the
power of God which was in him,
“smote the rock, and there came

forth water, that the children of
Israel might quench their thirst.

30 And notwithstanding they
being led, the Lord their God, their
Redeemer, going before them, “lead-
ing them by day and giving light
unto them by night, and doing all
things for them which were ’expe-
dient for man to receive, they hard-
ened their hearts and blinded their
minds, and ‘reviled against Moses
and against the true and living God.

31 And it came to pass that ac-
cording to his word he did ¢destroy
them; and according to his word he
did "lead them; and according to his
word he did do all things for them;
and there was not any thing done
save it were by his word.

32 And after they had crossed
the river Jordan he did make them
mighty unto the “driving out of the
children of the land, yea, unto the
scattering them to destruction.

33 And now, do ye suppose that
the children of this land, who were
in the land of promise, who were
driven out by our fathers, do ye
suppose that they were righteous?
Behold, I say unto you, Nay.

34 Do ye suppose that our fathers
would have been more choice than
they if they had been righteous? I
say unto you, Nay.

35 Behold, the Lord esteemeth all
“flesh in one; he that is righteous
is ‘favored of God, But behold, this

 

1 NEPHI 17:30-41

4people had rejected every word of
God, and they were ripe in iniquity;
and the fulness of the wrath of
God was upon them; and the Lord
did curse the land against them,
and bless it unto our fathers; yea,
he did curse it against them unto
their destruction, and he did bless
it unto our fathers unto their ob-
taining power over it.

36 Behold, the Lord hath created
the “earth that it should be *inhab-
ited; and he hath created his chil-
dren that they should possess it.

37 And he “raiseth up a righteous
nation, and destroyeth the nations
of the wicked.

38 And he leadeth away the righ-
teous into precious “lands, and the
wicked he °destroyeth, and curseth
the land unto them for their sakes.

39 He ruleth high in the heavens,
for it is his throne, and this earth
is his *footstool.

40 And he loveth those who will
have him to be their God. Behold,
he loved our “fathers, and he
’covenanted with them, yea, even
Abraham, ‘Isaac, and “Jacob; and he
remembered the covenants which
he had made; wherefore, he did
bring them out of the land of ‘Egypt.

41 And he did straiten them in the
wilderness with his rod; for they
“hardened their hearts, even as ye
have; and the Lord straitened them
because of their iniquity. He sent

fiery flying "serpents among them;
and after they were bitten he pre-
pared a way that they might be
‘healed; and the labor which they
had to perform was to look; and
because of the “simpleness of the
way, or the easiness of it, there were
many who perished.

42 And they did harden their hearts
from time to time, and they did ¢re-
vile against "Moses, and also against
God; nevertheless, ye know that
they were led forth by his matchless
power into the land of promise.

43 And now, after all these things,
the time has come that they have
become wicked, yea, nearly unto
ripeness; and I know not but they are
at this day about to be ¢destroyed;
for I know that the day must surely
come that they must be destroyed,
save a few only, who shall be led
away into captivity.

44 Wherefore, the Lord ¢com-
manded my father that he should
depart into the wilderness; and the
Jews also sought to take away his
life; yea, and *ye also have sought
to take away his life; wherefore, ye
are murderers in your hearts and
ye are like unto them.

45 Ye are “swift to do iniquity but
slow to remember the Lord your
God, Ye have seen an "angel, and he
spake unto you; yea, ye have heard
his voice from time to time; and he
hath spoken unto you ina still small
voice, but ye were ‘past feeling, that
ye could not feel his words; where-
fore, he has spoken unto you like
unto the voice of thunder, which
did cause the earth to shake as if
it were to divide asunder.

46 And ye also know that by the

 

40

“power of his almighty word he can
cause the earth that it shall pass
away; yea, and ye know that by his
word he can cause the rough places to
be made smooth, and smooth places
shall be broken up. O, then, why is it,
that ye can be so hard in your hearts?

47 Behold, my soul is rent with
anguish because of you, and my
heart is pained; I fear lest ye shall
be cast off forever. Behold, Iam @full
of the Spirit of God, insomuch that
my frame has °’no strength.

48 And now it came to pass that
when [ had spoken these words they
were angry with me, and were desir-
ous to throw me into the depths of
the sea; and as they came forth to lay
their hands upon me I spake unto
them, saying: In the name of the
Almighty God, lcommand you that
ye “touch me not, for lam filled with
the "power of God, even unto the
consuming of my flesh; and whoso
shall lay his hands upon me shall
‘wither even as a dried reed; and he
shall be as naught before the power
of God, for God shall smite him.

49 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, said unto them that they
should murmur no more against
their father; neither should they
withhold their labor from me, for
God had commanded me that I
should “build a ship.

50 And I said unto them: “If God
had commanded me to do all things
I could do them. If he should com-
mand me that I should say unto
this water, be thou earth, it should
be earth; and if I should say it, it
would be done.

great power, and has wrought so

many miracles among the children
of men, how is it that he cannot “in-
struct me, that I should build a ship?

52 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, said many things unto my
brethren, insomuch that they were
“confounded and could not contend
against me; neither durst they lay
their hands upon me nor touch
me with their fingers, even for
the space of many days. Now they
durst not do this lest they should
wither before me, so powerful was
the Spirit of God; and thus it had
wrought upon them.

53 And it came to pass that the
Lord said unto me: Stretch forth
thine hand again unto thy breth-
ren, and they shall not wither be-
fore thee, but I will “shock them,
saith the Lord, and this will I do,
that they may know that I am the
Lord their God.

54 And it came to pass that I
stretched forth my hand unto my
brethren, and they did not wither
before me; but the Lord did shake
them, even according to the word
which he had spoken.

55 And now, they said: We know
of a surety that the Lord is ¢with
thee, for we know that it is the
power of the Lord that has shaken
us. And they fell down before me,
and were about to "worship me, but
I would not suffer them, saying: lam
thy brother, yea, even thy younger
brother; wherefore, worship the
Lord thy God, and honor thy father
and thy mother, that thy ‘days may
be long in the land which the Lord
thy God shall give thee.

CHAPTER 18

The ship is finished—T he births of Jacob
and Joseph are mentioned—The

 

1 NEPHI 17:52-18:6

company embarks for the promised
land—tThe sons of Ishmael and their
wives join in revelry and rebellion—
Nephi is bound, and the ship is driven
back by a terrible tempest—Nephi
is freed, and by his prayer the storm
ceases—The people arrive in the prom-
ised land. About 591-589 B.c.

AND it came to pass that they did
*worship the Lord, and did go forth
with me; and we did work timbers
of curious ’workmanship. And the
Lord did show me from time to time
after what manner I should work
the timbers of the ‘ship.

2 Now I, Nephi, did not work the
timbers after the manner which
was learned by men, neither did
I build the ship after the manner
of men; but I did build it after the
manner which the Lord had shown
unto me; wherefore, it was not after
the manner of men.

3 And I, Nephi, did go into the
mount oft, and I did “pray oft unto
the Lord; wherefore the Lord "showed
unto me ‘great things.

4 And it came to pass that after I had
finished the ship, according to the
word of the Lord, my brethren beheld
that it was good, and that the work-
manship thereof was exceedingly
fine; wherefore, they did “humble
themselves again before the Lord.

5 And it came to pass that the voice
of the Lord came unto my father,
that we should arise and go down
into the ship.

6 And it came to pass that on the
morrow, after we had prepared all
things, much fruits and *meat from
the wilderness, and honey in abun-
dance, and provisions according
to that which the Lord had com-
manded us, we did go down into the
ship, with all our loading and our

’seeds, and whatsoever thing we
had brought with us, every one ac-
cording to his age; wherefore, we
did all go down into the ‘ship, with
our wives and our children.

7 And now, my father had begat
two sons in the wilderness; the elder
was called “Jacob and the younger
>Joseph.

8 And it came to pass after we had
all gone down into the ship, and had
taken with us our provisions and
things which had been commanded
us, we did put forth into the “sea
and were driven forth before the
wind towards the "promised land.

9 And after we had been “driven
forth before the wind for the space
of many days, behold, my brethren
and the sons of Ishmael and also
their wives began to make them-
selves merry, insomuch that they
began to dance, and to sing, and to
speak with much ’rudeness, yea, even
that they did forget by what power
they had been brought thither; yea,
they were lifted up unto exceeding
rudeness.

10 And I, Nephi, began to fear
exceedingly lest the Lord should
be angry with us, and smite us be-
cause of our iniquity, that we should
be swallowed up in the depths of
the sea; wherefore, I, Nephi, be-
gan to speak to them with much
soberness; but behold they were
“angry with me, saying: We will not
that our younger brother shall bea
’ruler over us.

11 And it came to pass that Laman
and Lemuel did take me and “bind
me with cords, and they did treat
me with much harshness; neverthe-
less, the Lord did suffer it that he
might show forth his power, unto the

 

42

fulfilling of his word which he had
’spoken concerning the wicked.

12 And it came to pass that after
they had bound me insomuch that
I could not move, the “compass,
which had been prepared of the
Lord, did cease to work.

13 Wherefore, they knew not
whither they should steer the ship,
insomuch that there arose a great
“storm, yea, a great and terrible tem-
pest, and we were driven back upon
the waters for the space of three
days; and they began to be fright-
ened exceedingly lest they should
be drowned in the sea; nevertheless
they did not loose me.

14 And on the fourth day, which
we had been driven back, the tem-
pest began to be exceedingly sore.

15 And it came to pass that we
were about to be swallowed up in
the depths of the sea. And after
we had been driven back upon the
waters for the space of four days,
my brethren began to “see that the
judgments of God were upon them,
and that they must perish save that
they should repent of their iniq-
uities; wherefore, they came unto
me, and loosed the bands which
were upon my wrists, and behold
they had swollen exceedingly; and
also mine ankles were much swol-
len, and great was the soreness
thereof.

16 Nevertheless, I did look unto
my God, and | did “praise him all
the day long; and I did not murmur
against the Lord because of mine
afflictions.

17 Now my father, Lehi, had said
many things unto them, and also
unto the sons of “Ishmael; but, be-
hold, they did breathe out much

threatenings against anyone that
should speak for me; and my parents
being ’stricken in years, and having
‘suffered much grief because of their
4children, they were brought down,
yea, even upon their sick-beds.

18 Because of their grief and much
sorrow, and the iniquity of my
brethren, they were brought near
even to be carried out of this time
to meet their God; yea, their “grey
hairs were about to be brought down
to lie low in the dust; yea, even they
were near to be cast with sorrow
into a watery grave.

19 And Jacob and Joseph also, be-
ing young, having need of much
nourishment, were grieved because
of the afflictions of their mother;
and also“my wife with her tears and
prayers, and also my children, did
not soften the hearts of my breth-
ren that they would loose me.

20 And there was nothing save
it were the power of God, which
threatened them with destruction,
could soften their “hearts; where-
fore, when they saw that they were
about to be swallowed up in the
depths of the sea they repented of
the thing which they had done, in-
somuch that they loosed me.

21 And it came to pass after they
had loosed me, behold, I took the
compass, and it did work whither I
desired it. And it came to pass that
I *prayed unto the Lord; and after
I had prayed the winds did cease,
and the storm did cease, and there
was a great calm.

22 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, did guide the ship, that we
sailed again towards the promised
land.

23 And it came to pass that after
we had sailed for the space of many
days we did arrive at the “promised

 

1 NEPHI 18:18-19:2

land; and we went forth upon the
land, and did pitch our tents; and
we did call it the promised land.
24 And it came to pass that we did
begin to till the earth, and we be-
gan to plant seeds; yea, we did put
all our “seeds into the earth, which
we had brought from the land of
Jerusalem. And it came to pass that
they did grow exceedingly; where-
fore, we were blessed in abundance.
25 And it came to pass that we did
find upon the land of promise, as
we journeyed in the wilderness, that
there were “beasts in the forests of
every kind, both the cow and the
ox, and the ass and the horse, and
the goat and the wild goat, and all
manner of wild animals, which
were for the use of men. And we
did find all manner of ’ore, both of
‘gold, and of silver, and of copper.

commanded me, wherefore I did
make plates of ore that I might
engraven upon them the “record
of my people. And upon the plates
which I made I did "engraven the
record of my ‘father, and also our
journeyings in the wilderness, and
the prophecies of my father; and
also many of mine own prophecies
have I engraven upon them.

2 And I Knew not at the time
when I made them that I should be

commanded of the Lord to make
“these plates; wherefore, the record
of my father, and the genealogy of
his fathers, and the more part of all
our proceedings in the wilderness
are engraven upon those first plates
of which I have spoken; wherefore,
the things which transpired before
I made *these plates are, of a truth,
more particularly made mention
upon the first plates.

3 And after I had made these plates
by way of commandment, I, Nephi,
received a commandment that the
ministry and the prophecies, the
more plain and precious parts of
them, should be written upon “these
plates; and that the things which
were written should be kept for
the instruction of my people, who
should possess the land, and also
for other "wise purposes, which
purposes are known unto the Lord.

4 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did make
a record upon the ¢other plates,
which gives an account, or which
gives a greater account of the wars
and contentions and destructions
of my people. And this have I done,
and commanded my people what
they should do after I was gone;
and that these plates should be
handed down from one generation
to another, or from one prophet to
another, until further command-
ments of the Lord.

5 And an account of my *making
these plates shall be given hereafter;
and then, behold, I proceed accord-

 

44

ing to that which I have spoken;
and this I do that the more sacred
things may be ’kept for the knowl-
edge of my people.

6 Nevertheless, I do not ¢write any-
thing upon plates save it be that I
think it be sacred. And now, if I
do err, even did they err of old; not
that I would excuse myself because
of other men, but because of the
‘weakness which is in me, according
to the flesh, I would excuse myself.

7 For the things which some men
esteem to be of great worth, both
to the body and soul, others set at
“naught and trample under their
feet. Yea, even the very God of Israel
do men *trample under their feet; I
say, trample under their feet but I
would speak in other words—they
set him at naught, and ‘hearken not
to the voice of his counsels.

8 And behold he “cometh, accord-
ing to the words of the angel, in
’six hundred years from the time
my father left Jerusalem.

9 And the world, because of their
iniquity, shall judge him to be a
thing of naught; wherefore they
scourge him, and he suffereth it; and
they smite him, and he suffereth
it. Yea, they “spit upon him, and he
suffereth it, because of his loving
’kindness and his ‘long-suffering
towards the children of men.

10 And the “God of our fathers,
who were “led out of Egypt, out of
bondage, and also were preserved
in the wilderness by him, yea, the

‘God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob, “yieldeth himself,
according to the words of the angel,
as aman, into the hands of “wicked
men, to be ‘lifted up, according to
the words of *Zenock, and to be
"crucified, according to the words
of Neum, and to be buried ina ‘sep-
ulchre, according to the words of
iZenos, which he spake concerning
the three days of "darkness, which
should be a sign given of his death
unto those who should inhabit the
isles of the sea, more especially
given unto those who are of the
‘house of Israel.

11 For thus spake the prophet: The
Lord God surely shall ¢visit all the
house of Israel at that day, some
with his voice, because of their
righteousness, unto their great joy
and salvation, and others with the
‘thunderings and the lightnings of
his power, by tempest, by fire, and
by ‘smoke, and ‘vapor of ‘darkness,
and by the opening of the “earth,
and by "mountains which shall be
carried up.

12 And Zall these things must
surely come, saith the prophet ’Ze-
nos. And the ‘rocks of the earth must
rend; and because of the ¢groanings
of the earth, many of the kings of

 

1 NEPHI 19:11-17

the isles of the sea shall be wrought
upon by the Spirit of God, to ex-
claim: The God of nature suffers.

13 And as for those who are at
Jerusalem, saith the prophet, they
shall be “scourged by all people,
because they crucify the God of
Israel, and turn their hearts aside,
rejecting signs and wonders, and
the power and glory of the God of
Israel.

14 And because they turn their
hearts aside, saith the prophet, and
have “despised the Holy One of Is-
rael, they shall wander in the flesh,
and perish, and become a "hiss and
a ‘byword, and be “hated among
all nations.

15 Nevertheless, when that day
cometh, saith the prophet, that they
“no more *turn aside their hearts
against the Holy One of Israel, then
will he remember the ‘covenants
which he made to their fathers.

16 Yea, then will he remember
the “isles of the sea; yea, and all
the people who are of the house of
Israel, will gather in, saith the Lord,
according to the words of the prophet
Zenos, from the four quarters of
the earth.

17 Yea, and all the earth shall see
the salvation of the Lord, saith the

prophet; every nation, kindred,
tongue and people shall be blessed.

18 And I, Nephi, have written these
things unto my people, that perhaps
I might persuade them that they
would “remember the Lord their
Redeemer.

19 Wherefore, I speak unto all the
house of Israel, if it so be that they
should obtain “these things.

20 For behold, I have workings in
the spirit, which doth “weary me
even that all my joints are weak,
for those who are at Jerusalem; for
had not the Lord been merciful, to
show unto me concerning them,
even as he had prophets of old, I
should have perished also.

21 And he surely did show unto
the “prophets of old all things ’con-
cerning them; and also he did show
unto many concerning us; where-
fore, it must needs be that we know
concerning them for they are writ-
ten upon the plates of brass.

22 Now it came to pass that I,
Nephi, did teach my brethren these
things; and it came to pass that I did
read many things to them, which
were engraven upon the “plates of
brass, that they might know con-
cerning the doings of the Lord in
other lands, among people of old.

23 And I did read many things
unto them which were written
in the “books of Moses; but that I
might more fully persuade them to
believe in the Lord their Redeemer
I did read unto them that which
was written by the prophet ’Isaiah;
for I did ‘liken all scriptures unto
us, that it might be for our “profit
and learning.

 

46

24 Wherefore I spake unto them,
saying: Hear ye the words of the
prophet, ye who are a “remnant of
the house of Israel, a "branch who
have been broken off; ‘hear ye the
words of the prophet, which were
written unto all the house of Israel,
and liken them unto yourselves, that
ye may have hope as well as your
brethren from whom ye have been
broken off; for after this manner
has the prophet written.

CHAPTER 20

The Lord reveals His purposes to Is-
rael—Israel has been chosen in the
furnace of affliction and is to go forth
from Babylon—Compare Isaiah 48.
About 588-570 B.C.

*HEARKEN and hear this, O house of
Jacob, who are called by the name of
Israel, and are come forth out of the
waters of Judah, or out of the wa-
ters of "baptism, who ‘swear by the
name of the Lord, and make mention
of the God of Israel, yet they swear
4not in truth nor in righteousness.

2 Nevertheless, they call them-
selves of the “holy city, but they do
’not stay themselves upon the God
of Israel, who is the Lord of Hosts;
yea, the Lord of Hosts is his name.

3 Behold, I have declared the “for-
mer things from the beginning; and
they went forth out of my mouth,
and I showed them, I did show them
suddenly.

4 And I did it because I knew that
thou art obstinate, and thy “neck is

to pass I “showed them thee; and
I showed them for fear lest thou
shouldst say—Mine idol hath done
them, and my graven image, and
my molten image hath commanded
them.

6 Thou hast seen and heard all this;
and will ye ‘not declare them? And
that I have showed thee new things
from this time, even hidden things,
and thou didst not know them.

7 They are created now, and not
from the beginning, even before
the day when thou heardest them
not they were declared unto thee,
lest thou shouldst say—Behold I
knew them.

8 Yea, and thou heardest not; yea,
thou knewest not; yea, from that
time thine ear was not opened; for
I knew that thou wouldst deal very
treacherously, and wast called a
“transgressor from the womb.

9 Nevertheless, for my “name’s
sake will I defer mine anger, and
for my praise will I refrain from
thee, that I cut thee not off.

10 For, behold, Ihave refined thee,
I have chosen thee in the furnace
of “affliction.

11 For mine own sake, yea, for
mine own sake will I do this, for I
will not suffer my “name to be pol-
luted, and I will "not give my glory
unto another.

12 Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and
Israel my called, for I am he; Iam
the “first, and I am also the last.

13 Mine hand hath also “laid
the foundation of the earth, and
my right hand hath spanned the

 

1 NEPHI 20:6-20

heavens. I °call unto them and they
stand up together.

14 All ye, assemble yourselves,
and hear; who among them hath
declared these things unto them?
The Lord hath loved him; yea, and
he will ¢fulfil his word which he
hath declared by them; and he
will do his pleasure on °Babylon,
and his arm shall come upon the
Chaldeans,

15 Also, saith the Lord; I the Lord,
yea, I have spoken; yea, I have called
*him to declare, I have brought
him, and he shall make his way
prosperous.

16 Come ye near unto me; I have
not spoken in “secret; from the
beginning, from the time that it
was declared have I spoken; and
the Lord God, and his ’Spirit, hath
sent me.

17 And thus saith the Lord, thy
“Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel;
I have sent him, the Lord thy God
who teacheth thee to profit, who
*leadeth thee by the way thou
shouldst go, hath done it.

18 O that thou hadst hearkened to
my “commandments—then had thy
’peace been as a river, and thy righ-
teousness as the waves of the sea.

19 Thy “seed also had been as the
sand; the offspring of thy bowels
like the gravel thereof; his name
should not have been cut off nor
destroyed from before me.

Lord hath redeemed his ‘servant

21 And they “thirsted not; he led
them through the deserts; he caused
the waters to flow out of the rock
for them; he clave the rock also and
the waters gushed out.

22 And notwithstanding he hath
done all this, and greater also, there
is no “peace, saith the Lord, unto
the wicked.

CHAPTER 21

The Messiah will be a light to the Gentiles
and will free the prisoners—Israel will
be gathered with power in the last days—
Kings will be their nursing fathers—
Compare Isaiah 49. About 588-570 B.C.

“AND again: Hearken, O ye house
of Israel, all ye that are broken off
and are driven out because of the
wickedness of the pastors of my
people; yea, all ye that are broken
off, that are scattered abroad, who
are of my people, O house of Is-
rael. Listen, O "isles, unto me, and
hearken ye people from ‘far; the
Lord hath called me from the womb;
from the bowels of my mother hath
he made mention of my name.

2 And he hath made my mouth
like a sharp sword; in the shadow of
his hand hath he hid me, and made
me a polished shaft; in his quiver
hath he hid me;

3 And said unto me: Thou art my
4servant, O Israel, in whom I will
be glorified.

4 Then I said, I have labored in
*vain, I have spent my strength
for naught and in vain; surely my
judgment is with the Lord, and my
work with my God.

 

48

5 And now, saith the Lord—that
“formed me from the womb that I
should be his servant, to bring Jacob
again to him—though Israel be not
gathered, yet shall 1 be glorious in
the eyes of the Lord, and my God
shall be my ’strength.

6 And he said: It is a light thing
that thou shouldst be my servant
to raise up the “tribes of Jacob, and
to restore the preserved of Israel. 1
will also give thee for a "light to the
“Gentiles, that thou mayest be my
salvation unto the ends of the earth.

7 Thus saith the Lord, the Re-
deemer of Israel, his Holy One, to
him whom man despiseth, to him
whom the nations abhorreth, to ser-
vant of rulers: Kings shall see and
arise, princes also shall worship,
because of the Lord that is faithful.

8 Thus saith the Lord: In an accept-
able time have I heard thee, O isles
of the sea, and in a day of salvation
have I helped thee; and I will pre-
serve thee, and give thee “my ser-
vant for a covenant of the people,
to establish the earth, to cause to
inherit the desolate heritages;

9 That thou mayest say to the
“prisoners: Go forth; to them that
sit in darkness: Show yourselves.
They shall feed in the ways, and
their ‘pastures shall be in all high
places.

10 They shall not hunger nor thirst,
neither shall the heat nor the sun
smite them; for he that hath mercy
on them shall lead them, even by
the springs of water shall he guide
them.

11 And I will make all my moun-
tains a way, and my “highways shall
be exalted.

12 And then, O house of Israel,
behold, “these shall come from far;
and lo, these from the north and
from the west; and these from the
land of Sinim.

13 *Sing, O heavens; and be joy-
ful, O earth; for the feet of those
who are in the east shall be estab-
lished; and *break forth into sing-
ing, O mountains; for they shall be
smitten no more; for the Lord hath
comforted his people, and will have
mercy upon his ‘afflicted.

14 But, behold, Zion hath said:
The Lord hath forsaken me, and
my Lord hath forgotten me—but he
will show that he hath not.

15 For can a “woman forget her
sucking child, that she should not
have 'compassion on the son of
her womb? Yea, they may ‘forget,
yet will I not forget thee, O house
of Israel.

16 Behold, I have graven thee upon
the “palms of my hands; thy walls
are continually before me.

17 Thy children shall make haste
against thy destroyers; and they
that made thee “waste shall go
forth of thee.

18 Lift up thine eyes round about
and behold; all these “gather them-
selves together, and they shall come
to thee. And as I live, saith the Lord,
thou shalt surely clothe thee with
them all, as with an ornament, and
bind them on even as a bride.

19 For thy waste and thy desolate
places, and the land of thy destruc-
tion, shall even now be too narrow
by reason of the inhabitants; and

 

1 NEPHI 21:12-26

they that swallowed thee up shall
be far away.

20 The children whom thou shalt
have, after thou hast lost the first,
shall “again in thine ears say: The
place is too strait for me; give place
to me that I may dwell.

21 Then shalt thou say in thine
heart: Who hath begotten me these,
seeing I have lost my children, and
am ‘desolate, a captive, and re-
moving to and fro? And who hath
brought up these? Behold, I was
left alone; these, where have they
been?

22 Thus saith the Lord God: Be-
hold, I will lift up mine hand to the
“Gentiles, and set up my “standard
to the people; and they shall bring
thy sons in their ‘arms, and thy
daughters shall be carried upon
their shoulders.

23 And “kings shall be thy "nursing

CHAPTER 22

Israel will be scattered upon all the face
of the earth—The Gentiles will nurse
and nourish Israel with the gospel in
the last days—Israel will be gathered
and saved, and the wicked will burn as
stubble—The kingdom of the devil will
be destroyed, and Satan will be bound.
About 588-570 B.c.

AND now it came to pass that after I,
Nephi, had read these things which
were engraven upon the “plates of
brass, my brethren came unto me
and said unto me: What ’meaneth
these things which ye have read?
Behold, are they to be understood
according to things which are ‘spiri-
tual, which shall come to pass ac-
cording to the spirit and not the
flesh?

2 And I, Nephi, said unto them:
Behold they were “manifest unto
the prophet by the voice of the
’Spirit; for by the Spirit are all
things made known unto the ‘proph-
ets, which shall come upon the
children of men according to the
flesh.

3 Wherefore, the things of which
I have read are things pertaining
to things both “temporal and spiri-
tual; for it appears that the house
of Israel, sooner or later, will be
’scattered upon all the face of the
earth, and also ‘among all nations.

 

50

4 And behold, there are many who
are already lost from the knowledge
of those who are at Jerusalem, Yea,
the more part of all the “tribes have
been "led away; and they are ‘scat-
tered to and fro upon the “isles of
the sea; and whither they are none
of us knoweth, save that we know
that they have been led away.

5 And since they have been led
away, these things have been pro-
phesied concerning them, and
also concerning all those who shall
hereafter be scattered and be con-
founded, because of the Holy One
of Israel; for against him will they
“harden their hearts; wherefore,
they shall be scattered among
all nations and shall be "hated of
all men.

6 Nevertheless, after they shall be
“nursed by the °Gentiles, and the
Lord has lifted up his hand upon
the Gentiles and set them up for a
standard, and their ‘children have
been carried in their arms, and
their daughters have been carried
upon their shoulders, behold these
things of which are spoken are tem-
poral; for thus are the covenants
of the Lord with our fathers; and
it meaneth us in the days to come,
and also all our brethren who are
of the house of Israel.

7 And it meaneth that the time
cometh that after all the house of
Israel have been scattered and con-
founded, that the Lord God will
raise up a mighty nation among the
“Gentiles, yea, even upon the face
of this land; and by them shall our
seed be °scattered.

Lord God will proceed to do a *mar-
velous work among the Gentiles,
which shall be of great ‘worth unto
our seed; wherefore, it is likened
unto their being nourished by the
4Gentiles and being carried in their
arms and upon their shoulders.

9 And it shall also be of “worth
unto the Gentiles; and not only unto
the Gentiles but ’unto all the “house
of Israel, unto the making known
of the ‘covenants of the Father of
heaven unto Abraham, saying: In
thy ‘seed shall all the kindreds of
the earth be ‘blessed.

10 And I would, my brethren, that
ye should know that all the kindreds
of the earth cannot be blessed un-
less he shall make “bare his arm in
the eyes of the nations.

11 Wherefore, the Lord God will
proceed to make bare his arm in the
eyes of all the “nations, in bringing
about his covenants and his gospel
unto those who are of the house
of Israel.

12 Wherefore, he will “bring them
again out of "captivity, and they
shall be ‘gathered together to the
lands of their ‘inheritance; and
they shall be “brought out of ob-
scurity and out of ‘darkness; and
they shall know that the ¢Lord is

 

1 NEPHI 22:9-16

their "Savior and their Redeemer,
the ‘Mighty One of Israel.

13 And the blood of that great and
Zabominable church, which is the
whore of all the earth, shall turn
upon their own heads; for they shall
’war among themselves, and the
sword of their ‘own hands shall fall
upon their own heads, and they shall
be drunken with their own blood.

14 And every “nation which shall
war against thee, O house of Israel,
shall be turned one against an-
other, and they shall °fall into the
pit which they digged to ensnare
the people of the Lord. And all that
‘fight against Zion shall be de-
stroyed, and that great whore, who
hath perverted the right ways of
the Lord, yea, that great and abomi-
nable church, shall tumble to the
4dust and great shall be the fall of it.

15 For behold, saith the prophet,
the time cometh speedily that Sa-
tan shall have no more power over
the hearts of the children of men;
for the day soon cometh that all the
proud and they who do wickedly
shall be as “stubble; and the day
cometh that they must be "burned.

16 For the time soon cometh that
the fulness of the wrath of God shall
be poured out upon all the children

of men; for he will not suffer that the
wicked shall destroy the righteous.

17 Wherefore, he will ¢preserve the
‘righteous by his power, even if it
so be that the fulness of his wrath
must come, and the righteous be
preserved, even unto the destruction
of their enemies by fire. Wherefore,
the righteous need not fear; for
thus saith the prophet, they shall
be saved, even if it so be as by fire.

18 Behold, my brethren, I say unto
you, that these things must shortly
come; yea, even blood, and fire, and
vapor of smoke must come; and it
must needs be upon the face of this
earth; and it cometh unto men ac-
cording to the flesh if it so be that
they will harden their hearts against
the Holy One of Israel.

19 For behold, the righteous shall
not perish; for the time surely must
come that all they who fight against
Zion shall be cut off.

20 And the Lord will surely “pre-
pare a way for his people, unto the
fulfilling of the words of Moses,
which he spake, saying: A "prophet
shall the Lord your God raise up
unto you, like unto me; him shall
ye hear in all things whatsoever
he shall say unto you. And it shall
come to pass that all those who will
not hear that prophet shall be ‘cut
off from among the people.

21 And now I, Nephi, declare unto
you, that this “prophet of whom
Moses spake was the Holy One of
Israel; wherefore, he shall execute
>judgment in righteousness.

22 And the righteous need not fear,

 

52

for they are those who shall not be
confounded. But it is the kingdom
of the devil, which shall be built up
among the children of men, which
kingdom is established among them
which are in the flesh—

23 For the time speedily shall come
that all ¢churches which are built
up to get gain, and all those who
are built up to get power over the
flesh, and those who are built up
to become "popular in the eyes of
the world, and those who seek the
lusts of the flesh and the things of
the world, and to do all manner of
iniquity; yea, in fine, all those who
belong to the kingdom of the ‘devil
are they who need fear, and tremble,
and ¢quake; they are those who must
be brought low in the dust; they
are those who must be ‘consumed
as stubble; and this is according to
the words of the prophet.

24 And the time cometh speed-
ily that the righteous must be led
up as “calves of the stall, and the
Holy One of Israel must reign in
dominion, and might, and power,
and great "glory.

25 And he ¢gathereth his children
from the four quarters of the earth;
and he numbereth his ’sheep, and
they know him; and there shall be
one fold and one shepherd; and he
shall feed his sheep, and in him
they shall find ‘pasture.

26 And because of the “righteous-
ness of his people, "Satan has no
power; wherefore, he cannot be
loosed for the space of ‘many years;
for he hath no power over the hearts

of the people, for they dwell in
righteousness, and the Holy One
of Israel “reigneth.

27 And now behold, I, Nephi, say
unto you that all these “things must
come according to the flesh.

28 But, behold, all nations, kin-
dreds, tongues, and people shall
dwell safely in the Holy One of Is-
rael if it so be that they will “repent.

29 And now I, Nephi, make an end;
for I durst not speak further as yet
concerning these things.

30 Wherefore, my brethren, I

1 NEPHI 22:27-2 NEPHI 1:5

would that ye should consider that
the things which have been written
upon the “plates of brass are true;
and they testify that a man must
be obedient to the commandments
of God.

31 Wherefore, ye need not sup-
pose that | and my father are the
only ones that have testified, and
also taught them. Wherefore, if ye
shall be obedient to the “command-
ments, and endure to the end, ye
shall be saved at the last day. And
thus it is. Amen.

THE SECOND BOOK OF NEPHI

An account of the death of Lehi. Nephi’s brethren rebel against him. The Lord
warns Nephi to depart into the wilderness. His journeyings in the wilderness,

and so forth.

CHAPTER 1

Lehi prophesies of a land of liberty—
His seed will be scattered and smitten if
they reject the Holy One of Israel—He
exhorts his sons to put on the armor
of righteousness. About 588-570 B.c.

ND now it came to pass that
after I, Nephi, had made an
end of teaching my brethren,

our “father, Lehi, also spake many
things unto them, and rehearsed
unto them, how great things the
Lord had done for them in bringing
them out of the land of Jerusalem.

2 And he spake unto them con-
cerning their “rebellions upon the
waters, and the mercies of God in

 

sparing their lives, that they were
not swallowed up in the sea.

3 And he also spake unto them con-
cerning the land of promise, which
they had obtained—how ‘merciful
the Lord had been in ’warning us
that we should flee out of the land
of Jerusalem.

4 For, behold, said he, I have “seen
a ’vision, in which I know that
‘Jerusalem is “destroyed; and had we
remained in Jerusalem we should
also have ‘perished.

5 But, said he, notwithstanding
our afflictions, we have obtained
a “land of promise, a land which is
’choice above all other lands; a land
which the Lord God hath ‘covenanted

with me should be a land for the
inheritance of my seed. Yea, the
Lord hath ¢covenanted this land
unto me, and to my children for-
ever, and also all those who should
be ‘led out of other countries by the
hand of the Lord.

6 Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy
according to the workings of the
Spirit which is in me, that there
shall “none come into this land save
they shall be brought by the hand
of the Lord.

7 Wherefore, this “land is conse-
crated unto him whom he shall
bring. And if it so be that they shall
serve him according to the com-
mandments which he hath given,
it shall be a land of *liberty unto
them; wherefore, they shall never
be brought down into captivity; if
so, it shall be because of iniquity;
for if iniquity shall abound ‘cursed
shall be the land for their sakes,
but unto the righteous it shall be
blessed forever.

8 And behold, it is wisdom that
this land should be “kept as yet from
the knowledge of other 'nations; for
behold, many nations would over-
run the land, that there would be
no place for an inheritance.

9 Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained
a “promise, that ‘inasmuch as those
whom the Lord God shall bring out
of the land of Jerusalem shall keep
his commandments, they shall “pros-
per upon the face of this land; and
they shall be kept from all other
nations, that they may possess this
land unto themselves. And if it so be
that they shall “keep his command-
ments they shall be blessed upon
the face of this land, and there shall

 

54

be none to molest them, nor to take
away the land of their “inheritance;
and they shall dwell safely forever.

10 But behold, when the time
cometh that they shall dwindle in
“unbelief, after they have received
so great blessings from the hand of
the Lord—having a knowledge of
the creation of the earth, and all
men, knowing the great and mar-
velous works of the Lord from the
creation of the world; having power
given them to do all things by faith;
having all the commandments from
the beginning, and having been
brought by his infinite goodness
into this precious land of promise—
behold, I say, if the day shall come
that they will reject the Holy One
of Israel, the true °Messiah, their
Redeemer and their God, behold,
the judgments of him that is “just
shall rest upon them.

11 Yea, he will bring “other na-
tions unto them, and he will give
unto them power, and he will take
away from them the lands of their
possessions, and he will cause them
to be ’scattered and smitten.

12 Yea, as one generation passeth
to another there shall be “blood-
sheds, and great visitations among
them; wherefore, my sons, I would
that ye would remember; yea, I
would that ye would hearken unto
my words.

13 O that ye would awake; awake
from a deep “sleep, yea, even from
the sleep of "hell, and shake off
the awful ‘chains by which ye are
bound, which are the chains which
bind the children of men, that they
are carried away captive down to the
eternal “gulf of misery and woe.

14 Awake! and arise from the dust,
and hear the words of a trembling
“parent, whose limbs ye must soon
lay down in the cold and silent
’erave, from whence no traveler
can ‘return; a few more “days and
I go the ‘way of all the earth.

15 But behold, the Lord hath 4re-
deemed my soul from hell; I have
beheld his "glory, and Lam encircled
about eternally in the ‘arms of his
“love.

16 And I desire that ye should re-
member to observe the “statutes and
the judgments of the Lord; behold,
this hath been the anxiety of my
soul from the beginning.

17 My heart hath been weighed
down with sorrow from time to
time, for I have feared, lest for the
hardness of your hearts the Lord
your God should come out in the
fulness of his wrath upon you, that
ye be ’cut off and destroyed forever;

18 Or, that a “cursing should come
upon you for the space of ’many
generations; and ye are visited by
sword, and by famine, and are hated,
and are led according to the will
and captivity of the ‘devil.

19O my sons, that these things
might not come upon you, but that
ye might be a choice and a “favored
people of the Lord. But behold, his
will be done; for his "ways are righ-
teousness forever.

20 And he hath said that: “Inas-

 

2 NEPHI 1:14-24

much as ye shall keep my °com-
mandments ye shall ‘prosper in the
land; but inasmuch as ye will not
keep my commandments ye shall
be cut off from my presence.

21 And now that my soul might
have joy in you, and that my heart
might leave this world with glad-
ness because of you, that I might
not be brought down with grief and
sorrow to the grave, arise from the
dust, my sons, and be “men, and be
determined in °one mind and in one
heart, united in all things, that ye
may not come down into captivity;

22 That ye may not be “cursed with
a sore cursing; and also, that ye may
not incur the displeasure of a "just
God upon you, unto the destruction,
yea, the eternal destruction of both
soul and body.

23 Awake, my sons; put on the ar-
mor of “righteousness. Shake off the
’chains with which ye are bound,
and come forth out of obscurity,
and arise from the dust.

24 Rebel no more against your
brother, whose views have been
*eglorious, and who hath kept the
commandments from the time that
we left Jerusalem; and who hath
been an instrument in the hands of
God, in bringing us forth into the
land of promise; for were it not for
him, we must have perished with
bhunger in the wilderness; never-
theless, ye sought to ‘take away his

life; yea, and he hath suffered much
sorrow because of you.

25 And I exceedingly fear and
tremble because of you, lest he
shall suffer again; for behold, ye
have “accused him that he sought
power and "authority over you; but
I know that he hath not sought for
power nor authority over you, but
he hath sought the glory of God,
and your own eternal welfare.

26 And ye have murmured because
he hath been plain unto you. Ye
say that he hath used “sharpness;
ye say that he hath been angry
with you; but behold, his "sharpness
was the sharpness of the power of
the word of God, which was in him;
and that which ye call anger was
the truth, according to that which
is in God, which he could not re-
strain, manifesting boldly concern-
ing your iniquities.

27 And it must needs be that the
“power of God must be with him,
even unto his commanding you
that ye must obey. But behold, it
was not he, but it was the ’Spirit of
the Lord which was in him, which
“opened his mouth to utterance that
he could not shut it.

28 And now my son, Laman, and
also Lemuel and Sam, and also my
sons who are the sons of Ishmael,
behold, if ye will hearken unto the
voice of Nephi ye shall not perish.
And if ye will hearken unto him
I leave unto you a “blessing, yea,
even my first blessing.

29 But if ye will not hearken unto
him I take away my “first blessing,
yea, even my blessing, and it shall
rest upon him.

30 And now, Zoram, I speak unto
you: Behold, thou art the “servant
of Laban; nevertheless, thou hast

 

56

been brought out of the land of Je-
rusalem, and I know that thou art
a true *friend unto my son, Nephi,
forever.

31 Wherefore, because thou hast
been faithful thy seed shall be
blessed “with his seed, that they
dwell in prosperity long upon the
face of this land; and nothing, save it
shall be iniquity among them, shall
harm or disturb their prosperity
upon the face of this land forever.

32 Wherefore, if ye shall keep the
commandments of the Lord, the
Lord hath consecrated this land
for the security of thy seed with
the seed of my son.

CHAPTER 2

Redemption comes through the Holy
Messiah—Freedom of choice (agency) is
essential to existence and progression—
Adam fell that men might be—Men are
free to choose liberty and eternal life.
About 588-570 B.C.

AND now, Jacob, I speak unto you:
Thou art my “firstborn in the days
of my tribulation in the wilderness.
And behold, in thy childhood thou
hast suffered afflictions and much
sorrow, because of the rudeness of
thy brethren.

2 Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn
in the wilderness, thou knowest
the greatness of God; and he shall
consecrate thine “afflictions for
thy gain.

3 Wherefore, thy soul shall be
blessed, and thou shalt dwell safely
with thy brother, Nephi; and thy
days shall be “spent in the service
of thy God. Wherefore, I know that
thou art redeemed, because of the
righteousness of thy Redeemer; for
thou hast *beheld that in the ‘fulness

of time he cometh to bring salvation
unto men.

4 And thou hast “beheld in thy
youth his glory; wherefore, thou
art blessed even as they unto whom
he shall minister in the flesh; for
the Spirit is the same, yesterday,
today, and forever. And the way is
prepared from the fall of man, and
’salvation is ‘free.

5 And men are instructed suffi-
ciently that they “know good from
evil. And the "law is given unto men.
And by the law no flesh is ‘justi-
fied; or, by the law men are “cut off.
Yea, by the temporal law they were
cut off; and also, by the spiritual
law they perish from that which
is good, and become miserable
forever.

6 Wherefore, *redemption cometh
in and through the "Holy “Messiah;
for he is full of 4grace and truth.

7 Behold, he offereth himself a
4sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends
of the law, unto all those who have
a broken heart and a contrite spirit;
and unto none else can the ‘ends
of the law be answered.

8 Wherefore, how great the impor-
tance to make these things known
unto the inhabitants of the earth,
that they may know that there
is no flesh that can dwell in the

 

2 NEPHI 2:4-11

presence of God, “save it be through
the merits, and mercy, and grace of
the Holy Messiah, who "layeth down
his life according to the flesh, and
taketh it again by the power of the
Spirit, that he may bring to pass
the ‘resurrection of the dead, being
the first that should rise.

9 Wherefore, he is the firstfruits
unto God, inasmuch as he shall
make “intercession for all the chil-
dren of men; and they that believe
in him shall be saved.

10 And because of the interces-
sion for “all, all men come unto
God; wherefore, they stand in the
presence of him, to be "judged of
him according to the truth and cho-
liness which is in him. Wherefore,
the ends of the law which the Holy
One hath given, unto the inflicting
of the “punishment which is affixed,
which punishment that is affixed
is in opposition to that of the hap-
piness which is affixed, to answer
the ends of the ‘atonement—

11 For it must needs be, that there
is an “opposition in all things. If not
so, my firstborn in the wilderness,
righteousness could not be brought
to pass, neither wickedness, nei-
ther holiness nor misery, neither
good nor bad. Wherefore, all things
must needs be a compound in one;

wherefore, if it should be one body
it must needs remain as dead, having
no life neither death, nor corruption
nor incorruption, happiness nor mis-
ery, neither sense nor insensibility.

12 Wherefore, it must needs have
been created for a thing of naught;
wherefore there would have been
no “purpose in the end of its cre-
ation. Wherefore, this thing must
needs destroy the wisdom of God
and his eternal purposes, and also
the power, and the mercy, and the
>justice of God.

13 And if ye shall say there is no
law, ye shall also say there is no sin.
If ye shall say there is no sin, ye
shall also say there is no righteous-
ness. And if there be no righteousness
there be no happiness. And if there
be no righteousness nor happiness
there be no punishment nor misery.
And if these things are not "there is
no God. And if there is no God we
are not, neither the earth; for there
could have been no creation of
things, neither to act nor to be acted
upon; wherefore, all things must
have vanished away.

14 And now, my sons, I speak unto
you these things for your profit and
“learning; for there is a God, and
he hath ’created all things, both
the heavens and the earth, and all
things that in them are, both things
to act and things to be ‘acted upon.

15 And to bring about his eternal

 

58

“purposes in the end of man, after
he had ’created our first parents,
and the beasts of the field and the
‘fowls of the air, and in fine, all
things which are created, it must
needs be that there was an opposi-
tion; even the “forbidden ‘fruit in
fopposition to the “tree of life; the
one being sweet and the other bitter.

16 Wherefore, the Lord God gave
unto man that he should 4act for
himself, Wherefore, man could not
bact for himself save it should be
that he was ‘enticed by the one or
the other.

17 And I, Lehi, according to the
things which I have read, must needs
suppose that an “angel of God, ac-
cording to that which is written, had
>fallen from heaven; wherefore, he
became a “devil, having sought that
which was evil before God.

18 And because he had fallen from
heaven, and had become miserable
forever, he “sought also the misery
of all mankind. Wherefore, he said
unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent,
who is the devil, who is the father
of all ‘lies, wherefore he said: Par-
take of the forbidden fruit, and ye
shall not die, but ye shall be as God,
‘knowing good and evil.

19 And after Adam and Eve had
*partaken of the forbidden fruit
they were driven out of the garden
of 'Eden, to till the earth.

children; yea, even the “family of
all the earth.

21 And the days of the children
of “men were prolonged, accord-
ing to the °will of God, that they
might ‘repent while in the flesh;
wherefore, their state became a
state of “probation, and their time
was lengthened, according to the
commandments which the Lord God
gave unto the children of men. For
he gave commandment that all men
must repent; for he showed unto all
men that they were “lost, because of
the transgression of their parents.

22 And now, behold, if Adam
had not transgressed he would not
have fallen, but he would have
remained in the garden of Eden.
And all things which were created
must have remained in the same
state in which they were after they
were created; and they must have
remained forever, and had no end.

23 And they would have had no
“children; wherefore they would
have remained in a state of inno-
cence, having no "joy, for they knew
no misery; doing no good, for they
knew no ‘sin.

24 But behold, all things have
been done in the wisdom of him
who “knoweth all things.

25 “Adam °fell that men might
be; and men ‘are, that they might
have “joy.

26 And the “Messiah cometh in
the fulness of time, that he may

 

2 NEPHI 2:21-30

’redeem the children of men from
the fall. And because that they are
‘redeemed from the fall they have
become “free forever, knowing good
from evil; to act for themselves
and not to be acted upon, save it
be by the punishment of the ‘law
at the great and last day, according
to the commandments which God
hath given.

27 Wherefore, men are “free ac-
cording to the flesh; and ‘all things
are “given them which are expedi-
ent unto man. And they are free to
‘choose ‘liberty and eternal ‘life,
through the great Mediator of all
men, or to choose captivity and
death, according to the captivity and
power of the devil; for he seeketh
that all men might be "miserable
like unto himself.

28 And now, my sons, I would
that ye should look to the great
"Mediator, and hearken unto his
great commandments; and be faith-
ful unto his words, and choose eter-
nal life, according to the will of his
Holy Spirit;

29 And not choose eternal death,
according to the will of the flesh
and the “evil which is therein, which
giveth the spirit of the devil power
to captivate, to bring you down to
‘hell, that he may reign over you in
his own kingdom.

CHAPTER 3

Joseph in Egypt saw the Nephites in vi-
sion—He prophesied of Joseph Smith,
the latter-day seer; of Moses, who would
deliver Israel; and of the coming forth of
the Book of Mormon. About 588-570 B.C.

AND now I speak unto you, Joseph,
my “last-born. Thou wast born in
the wilderness of mine afflictions;
yea, in the days of my greatest sor-
row did thy mother bear thee.

2 And may the Lord consecrate
also unto thee this “land, which is
a most precious land, for thine in-
heritance and the inheritance of
thy seed with thy brethren, for thy
security forever, if it so be that ye
shall keep the commandments of
the Holy One of Israel.

3 And now, Joseph, my last-born,
whom I have brought out of the
wilderness of mine afflictions, may
the Lord bless thee forever, for thy
“seed shall not utterly be "destroyed.

4 For behold, thou art the fruit of
my loins; and lam a descendant of
“Joseph who was carried captive
into Egypt. And great were the ‘cov-
enants of the Lord which he made
unto Joseph.

5 Wherefore, Joseph truly “saw our
day. And he obtained a "promise
of the Lord, that out of the fruit of
his loins the Lord God would raise

 

60

up a ‘righteous “branch unto the
house of Israel; not the Messiah, but
a branch which was to be broken
off, nevertheless, to be remembered
in the covenants of the Lord that
the Messiah should be made ‘mani-
fest unto them in the latter days, in
the spirit of power, unto the bring-
ing of them out of ‘darkness unto
light—yea, out of hidden darkness
and out of captivity unto freedom.

6 For Joseph truly testified, say-
ing: A “seer shall the Lord my God
raise up, who shall be a choice seer
unto the fruit of my “loins.

7 Yea, Joseph truly said: Thus saith
the Lord unto me: A choice “seer
will I *raise up out of the fruit of
thy loins; and he shall be esteemed
highly among the fruit of thy loins.
And unto him will I give command-
ment that he shall do a work for
the fruit of thy loins, his brethren,
which shall be of great worth unto
them, even to the bringing of them
to the ‘knowledge of the covenants
which I have made with thy fathers.

8 And I will give unto him a com-
mandment that he shall do “none
other work, save the work which
I shall command him. And I will
make him great in mine eyes; for
he shall do my work.

9 And he shall be great like unto
"Moses, whom I have said I would
raise up unto you, to ’deliver my
“people, O house of Israel.

10 And “Moses will I raise up, to
deliver thy people out of the land of
Egypt.

of the fruit of thy loins; and unto
him will I give "power to “bring
forth my word unto the seed of thy
loins—and not to the bringing forth
my word only, saith the Lord, but
to the convincing them of my word,
which shall have already gone forth
among them.

12 Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins
shall ¢write; and the fruit of the
loins of "Judah shall ‘write; and that
which shall be written by the fruit of
thy loins, and also that which shall
be written by the fruit of the loins
of Judah, shall grow together, unto
the “confounding of ‘false doctrines
and laying down of contentions, and
establishing ‘peace among the fruit
of thy loins, and ‘bringing them
to the "knowledge of their fathers
in the latter days, and also to the
knowledge of my covenants, saith
the Lord.

13 And out of weakness he shall
be made strong, in that day when
my work shall commence among all
my people, unto the restoring thee,
O house of Israel, saith the Lord.

14 And thus prophesied Joseph,
saying: Behold, that seer will the
Lord bless; and they that seek to
destroy him shall be confounded;
for this promise, which I have ob-
tained of the Lord, of the fruit of
my loins, shall be fulfilled. Behold,
I am sure of the fulfilling of this
promise;

15 And his ¢name shall be called af-
ter me; and it shall be after the "name
of his father. And he shall be ‘like
unto me; for the thing, which the
Lord shall bring forth by his hand,

 

2 NEPHI 3:12-21

by the power of the Lord shall bring
4my people unto ‘salvation.

16 Yea, thus prophesied Joseph: I
am sure of this thing, even as lam
sure of the promise of Moses; for
the Lord hath said unto me, I will
“preserve thy seed forever.

17 And the Lord hath said: I will
raise up a Moses; and I will give
power unto him ina rod; and I will
give judgment unto him in writing.
Yet I will not loose his tongue, that
he shall speak much, for I will not
make him mighty in speaking. But
I will ¢write unto him my law, by
the finger of mine own hand; and
I will make a ’spokesman for him.

18 And the Lord said unto me
also: I will raise up unto the fruit of
thy loins; and I will make for him
a spokesman. And I, behold, I will
give unto him that he shall write
the writing of the fruit of thy loins,
unto the fruit of thy loins; and the
spokesman of thy loins shall de-

20 And they shall “cry from the

generations have gone by them.
And it shall come to pass that their
cry shall go, even according to the
simpleness of their words.

“words shall proceed forth out of

my mouth unto their brethren who
are the fruit of thy loins; and the
weakness of their words will I make
strong in their faith, unto the re-
membering of my covenant which
I made unto thy fathers.

22 And now, behold, my son Jo-
seph, after this manner did my
father of old “prophesy.

23 Wherefore, because of this cov-
enant thou art “blessed; for thy seed
shall not be destroyed, for they shall
*hearken unto the words of the book.

24 And there shall rise up “one
mighty among them, who shall do
much good, both in word and in
deed, being an instrument in the
hands of God, with exceeding faith,
to work mighty wonders, and do
that thing which is great in the sight
of God, unto the bringing to pass
much "restoration unto the house
of Israel, and unto the seed of thy
brethren.

25 And now, blessed art thou,
Joseph. Behold, thou art little;
wherefore hearken unto the words
of thy brother, Nephi, and it shall
be done unto thee even according
to the words which I have spoken.
Remember the words of thy dying
father. Amen.

CHAPTER 4

Lehi counsels and blesses his poster-
ity—He dies and is buried—Nephi
glories in the goodness of God—Nephi
puts his trust in the Lord forever. About
588-570 B.C.

AND now, I, Nephi, speak concerning
the prophecies of which my father
hath spoken, concerning “Joseph,
who was carried into Egypt.

 

62

2 For behold, he truly prophe-
sied concerning all his seed. And
the “prophecies which he wrote,
there are not many greater. And he
prophesied concerning us, and our
future generations; and they are
written upon the "plates of brass.

3 Wherefore, after my father had
made an end of speaking concerning
the prophecies of Joseph, he called
the children of Laman, his sons, and
his daughters, and said unto them:
Behold, my sons, and my daughters,
who are the sons and the daugh-
ters of my “firstborn, | would that
ye should give ear unto my words.

4 For the Lord God hath said that:
“Inasmuch as ye shall keep my com-
mandments ye shall prosper in the
land; and inasmuch as ye will not
keep my commandments ye shall
be cut off from my presence.

5 But behold, my sons and my
daughters, I cannot go down to my
grave save I should leave a “blessing
upon you; for behold, I know that
if ye are "brought up in the ‘way ye
should go ye will not depart from it.

6 Wherefore, if ye are “cursed,
behold, I leave my blessing upon
you, that the ’cursing may be taken
from you and be answered upon
the ‘heads of your parents.

7 Wherefore, because of my bless-
ing the Lord God will *not suffer
that ye shall perish; wherefore, he
will be "merciful unto you and unto
your seed forever.

8 And it came to pass that after my
father had made an end of speaking
to the sons and daughters of Laman,
he caused the sons and daughters of
Lemuel to be brought before him.

9 And he spake unto them, saying:

Behold, my sons and my daughters,
who are the sons and the daughters
of my second son; behold I leave
unto you the same blessing which
I left unto the sons and daughters
of Laman; wherefore, thou shalt not
utterly be destroyed; but in the end
thy seed shall be blessed.

10 And it came to pass that when
my father had made an end of speak-
ing unto them, behold, he spake
unto the sons of “Ishmael, yea, and
even all his household.

11 And after he had made an end
of speaking unto them, he spake
unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou,
and thy “seed; for thou shalt in-
herit the land like unto thy brother
Nephi. And thy seed shall be num-
bered with his seed; and thou shalt
be even like unto thy brother, and
thy seed like unto his seed; and
thou shalt be blessed in all thy
days.

12 And it came to pass after my
father, Lehi, had “spoken unto all
his household, according to the
feelings of his heart and the Spirit
of the Lord which was in him, he
waxed "old. And it came to pass that
he died, and was buried.

13 And it came to pass that not
many days after his death, Laman
and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael
were “angry with me because of the
admonitions of the Lord.

14 For I, Nephi, was constrained to
speak unto them, according to his
word; for I had spoken many things
unto them, and also my father, be-
fore his death; many of which say-
ings are written upon mine “other

 

2 NEPHI 4:10-23

plates; for a more history part are
written upon mine other plates.

15 And upon “these I ‘write the
things of my soul, and many of
the scriptures which are engraven
upon the plates of brass. For my
soul ‘delighteth in the scriptures,
and my heart “pondereth them, and
writeth them for the ‘learning and
the profit of my children.

16 Behold, my “soul delighteth
in the things of the Lord; and my
bheart pondereth continually upon
the things which I have seen and
heard.

17 Nevertheless, notwithstanding
the great “goodness of the Lord, in
showing me his great and marvel-
ous works, my heart exclaimeth:
O wretched man that I am! Yea,
my heart ‘sorroweth because of my
flesh; my soul grieveth because of
mine iniquities.

181 am encompassed about, be-
cause of the temptations and the
sins which do so easily “beset me.

19 And when I desire to rejoice,
my heart groaneth because of my
sins; nevertheless, I know in whom
I have “trusted.

20 My God hath been my “support;
he hath led me through mine ’af-
flictions in the wilderness; and he
hath preserved me upon the waters
of the great deep.

21 He hath filled me with his
“love, even unto the "consuming
of my flesh.

22 He hath confounded mine “en-
emies, unto the causing of them to
quake before me.

23 Behold, he hath heard my cry by

day, and he hath given me *knowl-
edge by >visions in the night-time.

24 And by day have I waxed bold
in mighty “prayer before him; yea,
my voice have I sent up on high;
and angels came down and minis-
tered unto me.

25 And upon the wings of his Spirit
hath my body been “carried away
upon exceedingly high mountains.
And mine eyes have beheld great
things, yea, even too great for man;
therefore I was bidden that I should
not write them.

26 O then, if I have seen so great
things, if the Lord in his condescen-
sion unto the children of men hath
“visited men in so much ’mercy,
why should my “heart weep and my
soul linger in the valley of sorrow,
and my flesh waste away, and my
strength slacken, because of mine
afflictions?

27 And why should I “yield to
sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why
should I give way to *temptations,
that the evil one have place in my
heart to destroy my ‘peace and af-
flict my soul? Why am I “angry be-
cause of mine enemy?

28 Awake, my soul! No longer
“droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart,
and give place no more for the ’en-
emy of my soul.

29 Do not “anger again because of
mine enemies. Do not slacken my
strength because of mine afflictions.

30 Rejoice, O my “heart, and cry
unto the Lord, and say: O Lord, I
will praise thee forever; yea, my

 

64

soul will rejoice in thee, my God,
and the ’rock of my salvation.

31 O Lord, wilt thou *redeem my
soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of
the hands of mine enemies? Wilt
thou make me that I may shake at
the appearance of ’sin?

32 May the gates of hell be shut
continually before me, because that
my “heart is broken and my spirit
is contrite! O Lord, wilt thou not
shut the gates of thy righteousness
before me, that I may ’walk in the
path of the low valley, that I may
be strict in the plain road!

33 O Lord, wilt thou encircle me
around in the robe of thy “righ-
teousness! O Lord, wilt thou make
a way for mine escape before mine
’enemies! Wilt thou make my path
straight before me! Wilt thou not
place a stumbling block in my way—
but that thou wouldst clear my way
before me, and hedge not up my
way, but the ways of mine enemy.

34 O Lord, I have “trusted in thee,
and I will *trust in thee forever. I
will not put my ‘trust in the arm
of flesh; for I know that cursed is
he that putteth his “trust in the
arm of flesh, Yea, cursed is he that
putteth his trust in man or maketh
flesh his arm.

35 Yea, I know that God will give
“liberally to him that asketh. Yea,
my God will give me, if I °ask “not
amiss; therefore I will lift up my
voice unto thee; yea, I will cry
unto thee, my God, the “rock of my
“righteousness. Behold, my voice

CHAPTER 5

The Nephites separate themselves from
the Lamanites, keep the law of Moses,
and build a temple—Because of their
unbelief, the Lamanites are cut off from
the presence of the Lord, are cursed,
and become a scourge unto the Neph-
ites. About 588-559 B.C.

BEHOLD, it came to pass that I,
Nephi, did cry much unto the Lord
my God, because of the “anger of
my brethren.

2 But behold, their “anger did in-
crease against me, insomuch that
they did seek to take away my life.

3 Yea, they did murmur against me,
saying: Our younger brother thinks
to “rule over us; and we have had
much trial because of him; where-
fore, now let us slay him, that we
may not be afflicted more because
of his words, For behold, we will
not have him to be our ruler; for it
belongs unto us, who are the elder
brethren, to "rule over this people.

4 Now I do not write upon these
plates all the words which they
murmured against me. But it suf-
ficeth me to say, that they did seek
to take away my life.

5 And it came to pass that the
Lord did “warn me, that I, "Nephi,
should depart from them and flee
into the wilderness, and all those
who would go with me.

6 Wherefore, it came to pass that
I, Nephi, did take my family, and
also *Zoram and his family, and Sam,
mine elder brother and his family,

 

2 NEPHI 5:1-14

and Jacob and Joseph, my younger
brethren, and also my sisters, and
all those who would go with me.
And all those who would go with
me were those who believed in the
’warnings and the revelations of
God; wherefore, they did hearken
unto my words.

7 And we did take our tents and
whatsoever things were possible for
us, and did journey in the wilderness
for the space of many days. And af-
ter we had journeyed for the space
of many days we did pitch our tents.

8 And my people would that we
should call the name of the place
*Nephi; wherefore, we did call it
Nephi.

9 And all those who were with me
did take upon them to call them-
selves the “people of Nephi.

10 And we did observe to keep the
judgments, and the “statutes, and
the commandments of the Lord in
all things, according to the "law
of Moses.

11 And the Lord was with us; and
we did “prosper exceedingly; for we
did sow seed, and we did reap again
in abundance. And we began to raise
flocks, and herds, and animals of
every kind.

12 And I, Nephi, had also brought
the records which were engraven
upon the “plates of brass; and also
the ’ball, or “compass, which was
prepared for my father by the hand
of the Lord, according to that which
is written.

13 And it came to pass that we
began to prosper exceedingly, and
to multiply in the land.

14 And I, Nephi, did take the “sword
of Laban, and after the manner

of it did make many ’swords, lest
by any means the people who were
now called Lamanites should come
upon us and destroy us; for I knew
their ‘hatred towards me and my
children and those who were called
my people.

15 And I did teach my people to
“build buildings, and to ’work in
all “manner of wood, and of 4iron,
and of copper, and of “brass, and
of steel, and of ‘gold, and of silver,
and of precious ores, which were
in great abundance.

16 And I, Nephi, did “build a
*temple; and I did construct it af-
ter the manner of the temple of
‘Solomon save it were not built of
so many “precious things; for they
were not to be found upon the land,
wherefore, it could not be built like
unto Solomon’s ‘temple. But the
manner of the construction was
like unto the temple of ‘Solomon;
and the workmanship thereof was
exceedingly fine.

17 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, did cause my people to be
“industrious, and to "labor with their
Shands.

18 And it came to pass that they
would that I should be their “king.
But I, Nephi, was desirous that they
should have no king; nevertheless,
I did for them according to that
which was in my power.

19 And behold, the words of the
Lord had been fulfilled unto my

 

66

brethren, which he spake concern-
ing them, that I should be their
“ruler and their teacher, Wherefore,
I had been their ruler and their
>teacher, according to the command-
ments of the Lord, until the time
they sought to take away my life.

20 Wherefore, the word of the Lord
was fulfilled which he spake unto
me, saying that: Inasmuch as they
will ¢not hearken unto thy words
they shall be ’cut off from the pres-
ence of the Lord. And behold, they
were ‘cut off from his presence.

21 And he had caused the “curs-
ing to come upon them, yea, even
a sore cursing, because of their in-
iquity. For behold, they had hard-
ened their hearts against him, that
they had become like unto a flint;
wherefore, as they were white, and
exceedingly fair and °delightsome,
that they might not be ‘enticing
unto my people the Lord God did
cause a “skin of ‘blackness to come
upon them.

22 And thus saith the Lord God: I
will cause that they shall be “loath-
some unto thy people, save they
shall repent of their iniquities.

23 And cursed shall be the seed of
him that “mixeth with their seed;
for they shall be cursed even with
the same cursing. And the Lord
spake it, and it was done.

24 And because of their “cursing
which was upon them they did
become an idle people, full of

mischief and subtlety, and did seek
in the wilderness for beasts of prey.

25 And the Lord God said unto
me: They shall be a scourge unto
thy seed, to “stir them up in remem-
brance of me; and inasmuch as they
will not remember me, and hearken
unto my words, they shall scourge
them even unto destruction.

26 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,
did “consecrate Jacob and Joseph,
that they should be "priests and
‘teachers over the land of my people.

27 And it came to pass that we lived
after the manner of “happiness.

28 And thirty years had passed
away from the time we left Jeru-
salem.

29 And I, Nephi, had kept the
“records upon my plates, which I
had made, of my people thus far.

30 And it came to pass that the
Lord God said unto me: “Make other
plates; and thou shalt engraven
many things upon them which are
good in my sight, for the profit of
thy people.

31 Wherefore, I, Nephi, to be obe-
dient to the commandments of the
Lord, went and made “these plates
upon which I have engraven these
things.

32 And I engraved that which
is pleasing unto God. And if my
people are pleased with the things
of God they will be pleased with
mine engravings which are upon
these plates.

33 And if my people desire to
know the more particular part of
the history of my people they must
search mine “other "plates.

34 And it sufficeth me to say that
forty years had passed away, and
we had already had wars and con-
tentions with our brethren.

 

2 NEPHI 5:25-6:5

CHAPTER 6

Jacob recounts Jewish history: The
Babylonian captivity and return; the
ministry and crucifixion of the Holy
One of Israel; the help received from
the Gentiles; and the Jews’ latter-day
restoration when they believe in the
Messiah. About 559-545 B.c.

THE “words of Jacob, the brother
of Nephi, which he spake unto the
people of Nephi:

2 Behold, my beloved brethren, I,
Jacob, having been called of God,
and ordained after the manner of
his holy “order, and having been
consecrated by my brother Nephi,
unto whom ye look as a "king or a
protector, and on whom ye depend
for safety, behold ye know that I
have spoken unto you exceedingly
many things.

3 Nevertheless, I speak unto you
again; for 1am desirous for the ¢wel-
fare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety
is great for you; and ye yourselves
know that it ever has been. For I
have exhorted you with all diligence;
and I have taught you the words of
my father; and I have spoken unto
you concerning all things which
are written, from the creation of
the world.

4 And now, behold, I would speak
unto you concerning things which
are, and which are to come; where-
fore, I will read you the words of
“Isaiah. And they are the words
which my brother has desired that I
should speak unto you. And I speak
unto you for your sakes, that ye
may learn and glorify the name of
your God.

5 And now, the words which I shall
read are they which Isaiah spake
concerning all the house of Israel;

wherefore, they may be “likened
unto you, for ye are of the house of
Israel. And there are many things
which have been spoken by Isaiah
which may be likened unto you, be-
cause ye are of the house of Israel.

6 And now, these are the words:
“Thus saith the Lord God: Behold,
I will lift up mine hand to the
Gentiles, and set up my °standard
to the people; and they shall bring
thy sons in their arms, and thy
daughters shall be carried upon their
shoulders.

7 And “kings shall be thy nursing
fathers, and their queens thy nurs-
ing mothers; they shall bow down
to thee with their faces towards the
earth, and lick up the dust of thy
feet; and thou shalt know that °I
am the Lord; for they shall not be
ashamed that ‘wait for me.

8 And now I, Jacob, would speak
somewhat concerning these words.
For behold, the Lord has shown me
that those who were at “Jerusalem,
from whence we came, have been
’slain and ‘carried away captive.

9° Nevertheless, the Lord has shown
unto me that they should “return
again. And he also has shown unto
me that the Lord God, the Holy One
of Israel, should manifest himself
unto them in the flesh; and after
he should manifest himself they
should "scourge him and ‘crucify
him, according to the words of the
angel who spake it unto me.

 

68

10 And after they have “hardened
their hearts and “stiffened their
necks against the Holy One of Israel,
behold, the ‘judgments of the Holy
One of Israel shall come upon them.
And the day cometh that they shall
be smitten and afflicted.

11 Wherefore, after they are driven
to and fro, for thus saith the angel,
many shall be afflicted in the flesh,
and shall not be suffered to “per-
ish, because of the prayers of the
faithful; they shall be scattered, and
smitten, and hated; nevertheless, the
Lord will be merciful unto them,
that "when they shall come to the
‘knowledge of their Redeemer, they
shall be “gathered together again
to the “lands of their inheritance.

12 And blessed are the “Gentiles,
they of whom the prophet has writ-
ten; for behold, if it so be that they
shall repent and fight not against
Zion, and do not unite themselves to
that great and ’abominable church,
they shall be saved; for the Lord God
will fulfil his “covenants which he
has made unto his children; and for
this cause the prophet has written
these things.

13 Wherefore, they that fight
against Zion and the covenant peo-
ple of the Lord shall lick up the
dust of their feet; and the people
of the Lord shall not be “ashamed.
For the people of the Lord are they
who >wait for him; for they still
wait for the coming of the Messiah.

14 And behold, according to the
words of the prophet, the Messiah
will set himself again the “second
time to recover them; wherefore, he
will ’manifest himself unto them
in power and great glory, unto the
‘destruction of their enemies, when
that day cometh when they shall
believe in him; and none will he
destroy that believe in him.

15 And they that believe not in
him shall be ¢destroyed, both by
‘fire, and by tempest, and by earth-
quakes, and by ‘bloodsheds, and by
‘pestilence, and by ‘famine. And
they shall know that the Lord is
God, the Holy One of Israel.

16 *For shall the prey be taken
from the mighty, or the "lawful
captive delivered?

17 But thus saith the Lord: Even
the captives of the mighty shall be
taken away, and the prey of the
terrible shall be delivered; “for the
’Mighty God shall ‘deliver his cov-
enant people. For thus saith the
Lord: I will contend with them that
contendeth with thee—

18 And I will feed them that
oppress thee, with their own flesh;
and they shall be drunken with
their own blood as with sweet
wine; and all flesh shall know that
I the Lord am thy Savior and thy
“Redeemer, the "Mighty One of
Jacob.

CHAPTER 7

Jacob continues reading from Isaiah:
Isaiah speaks messianically—The
Messiah will have the tongue of the
learned—He will give His back to the
smiters—He will not be confounded—
Compare Isaiah 50. About 559-545 B.C.

“YEA, for thus saith the Lord: Have
I put thee away, or have I cast thee
off forever? For thus saith the Lord:
Where is the "bill of your mother’s
‘divorcement? To whom have I| put
thee away, or to which of my “credi-
tors have I ‘sold you? Yea, to whom
have I sold you? Behold, for your
iniquities have ye sold yourselves,
and for your transgressions is your
mother put away.

2 Wherefore, when I came, there
was no man; when I “called, yea,
there was none to answer. O house of
Israel, is my hand shortened at all
that it cannot redeem, or have I no
power to deliver? Behold, at my re-
buke I *dry up the ‘sea, I make their
“rivers a wilderness and their ‘fish
to stink because the waters are dried
up, and they die because of thirst.

3 Iclothe the heavens with “black-
ness, and I make "sackcloth their
covering.

4 The Lord God hath given me the
“tongue of the learned, that I should
know how to speak a word in season

“ear, and I was not rebellious, nei-
ther turned away back.

61 gave my back to the “smiter,
and my cheeks to them that plucked
off the hair. I hid not my face from
’shame and spitting.

7 For the Lord God will help me,
therefore shall I not be confounded.
Therefore have I set my face like
a flint, and I know that I shall not
be “ashamed.

8 And the Lord is near, and he “jus-
tifieth me. Who will contend with
me? Let us stand together. Who is
mine adversary? Let him come near
me, and I will "smite him with the
strength of my mouth.

9 For the Lord God will help me.
And all they who shall ¢condemn
me, behold, all they shall ’wax old
as a garment, and the moth shall

10 Who is among you that feareth
the Lord, that obeyeth the “voice of
his servant, that °walketh in dark-
ness and hath no light?

that compass yourselves about with
sparks, walk in the light of “your
fire and in the sparks which ye have
kindled. °This shall ye have of mine

CHAPTER 8

Jacob continues reading from Isaiah:
In the last days, the Lord will comfort
Zion and gather Israel—The redeemed

 

70

will come to Zion amid great joy—
Compare Isaiah 51 and 52:1-2. About
559-545 B.C.

*HEARKEN unto me, ye that follow
after righteousness. Look unto the
’rock from whence ye are hewn, and
to the hole of the pit from whence
ye are digged.

2 Look unto Abraham, your “father,
and unto Sarah, she that bare you;
for I called him alone, and blessed
him,

3 For the Lord shall ¢comfort °Zion,
he will comfort all her waste places;
and he will make her ‘wilderness
like “Eden, and her desert like the
garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness
shall be found therein, thanksgiv-
ing and the voice of melody.

4 Hearken unto me, my people; and
give ear unto me, O my nation; for
a “law shall proceed from me, and
I will make my judgment to rest
for a ‘light for the people.

5 My righteousness is near; my
4salvation is gone forth, and mine
arm shall *judge the people. The
‘isles shall wait upon me, and on
mine arm shall they trust.

6 Lift up your eyes to the “heavens,
and look upon the earth beneath;
for the heavens shall vanish away
like smoke, and the earth shall
‘wax old like a garment; and they
that dwell therein shall die in like
manner. But my salvation shall be
forever, and my righteousness shall
not be abolished.

7 Hearken unto me, ye that know

heart I have written my law, “fear

9 “Awake, awake! Put on ’strength,
O arm of the Lord; awake as in the
ancient days. Art thou not he that
hath cut ‘Rahab, and wounded the
4dragon?

10 Art thou not he who hath dried
the sea, the waters of the great deep;
that hath made the depths of the
sea a “way for the ransomed to pass
over?

11 Therefore, the “redeemed of the

heads; and they shall obtain glad-
ness and joy; sorrow and “mourning
shall flee away.

forteth you. Behold, who art thou,
that thou shouldst be ’afraid of
man, who shall die, and of the son
of man, who shall be made like unto
“grass?

13 And “forgettest the Lord thy
maker, that hath ’stretched forth
the heavens, and laid the founda-
tions of the earth, and hast feared
continually every day, because of
the fury of the ‘oppressor, as if he
were ready to destroy? And where
is the fury of the oppressor?

14 The “captive exile hasteneth,
that he may be loosed, and that he

 

2 NEPHI 8:8-23

should not die in the pit, nor that
his bread should fail.

15 But I am the Lord thy God,
whose “waves roared; the Lord of
Hosts is my name.

16 And I have “put my words in
thy mouth, and have covered thee
in the shadow of mine hand, that
I may plant the heavens and lay
the foundations of the earth, and
say unto Zion: Behold, thou art my
’people.

17 Awake, awake, stand up, O Je-
rusalem, which hast drunk at the
hand of the Lord the “cup of his
>fury—thou hast drunken the dregs
of the cup of trembling wrung out—

18 And none to guide her among
all the sons she hath brought forth;
neither that taketh her by the hand,
of all the sons she hath brought up.

19 These two “sons are come unto
thee, who shall be sorry for thee—
thy desolation and destruction, and
the famine and the sword—and by
whom shall I comfort thee?

20 Thy sons have fainted, save
these two; they lie at the head of
all the streets; as a wild bull ina
net, they are full of the fury of the
Lord, the rebuke of thy God.

21 Therefore hear now this, thou
afflicted, and “drunken, and not
with wine:

22 Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord
and thy God “pleadeth the cause of
his people; behold, I have taken out
of thine hand the cup of trembling,
the dregs of the cup of my fury;
thou shalt no more drink it again.

CHAPTER 9

Jacob explains that the Jews will be
gathered in all their lands of promise—
The Atonement ransoms man from the
Fall—The bodies of the dead will come
forth from the grave, and their spirits
from hell and from paradise—They will
be judged—The Atonement saves from
death, hell, the devil, and endless tor-
ment—tThe righteous are to be saved in
the kingdom of God—Penalties for sins
are set forth—The Holy One of Israel is
the keeper of the gate. About 559-545 B.C.

AND now, my beloved brethren, I
have read these things that ye might
know concerning the ¢covenants of
the Lord that he has covenanted
with all the house of Israel—

2 That he has spoken unto the Jews,
by the mouth of his holy prophets,
even from the beginning down,
from generation to generation, until
the time comes that they shall be

 

72

“restored to the true church and fold
of God; when they shall be ’gathered
home to the ‘lands of their inheri-
tance, and shall be established in
all their lands of promise.

3 Behold, my beloved brethren, I
speak unto you these things that ye
may rejoice, and “lift up your heads
forever, because of the blessings
which the Lord God shall bestow
upon your children.

4 For I know that ye have searched
much, many of you, to know of
things to come; wherefore I know
that ye know that our “flesh must
waste away and die; nevertheless,
in our "bodies we shall see God.

5 Yea, I know that ye know that in
the body he shall show himself unto
those at Jerusalem, from whence
we came; for it is expedient that it
should be among them; for it be-
hooveth the great “Creator that he
’suffereth himself to become “sub-
ject unto man in the flesh, and “die
for ‘all men, that all men might be-
come subject unto him.

6 For as “death hath passed upon
all men, to fulfil the merciful plan
of the great Creator, there must
needs be a power of ‘resurrection,
and the resurrection must needs
come unto man by reason of the
“fall; and the fall came by reason
of ‘transgression; and because man
became fallen they were ‘cut off
from the “presence of the Lord.

7 Wherefore, it must needs be
an “infinite °“atonement—save it
should be an infinite atonement this

corruption could not put on incor-
ruption. Wherefore, the ‘first judg-
ment which came upon man must
needs have “remained to an endless
duration. And if so, this flesh must
have laid down to rot and to crumble
to its mother earth, to rise no more.

8 O the “wisdom of God, his "mercy
and ‘grace! For behold, if the “flesh
should rise no more our spirits must
become subject to that angel who
*fell from before the presence of
the Eternal God, and became the
fdevil, to rise no more.

9 And our spirits must have
become “like unto him, and we be-
come devils, "angels to a ‘devil, to
be ‘shut out from the presence of
our God, and to remain with the
father of “lies, in misery, like unto
himself; yea, to that being who
Meguiled our first parents, who
*transformeth himself nigh unto an
“angel of light, and ‘stirreth up the
children of men unto ‘secret combi-
nations of murder and all manner
of secret works of darkness.

10 O how great the “goodness of
our God, who prepareth a way for
our ’escape from the grasp of this
awful monster; yea, that monster,
‘death and “hell, which I call the
death of the body, and also the death
of the spirit.

 

2 NEPHI 9:8-14

11 And because of the way of
“deliverance of our God, the Holy
One of Israel, this "death, of which
I have spoken, which is the tempo-
ral, shall deliver up its dead; which
death is the grave.

12 And this “death of which I have
spoken, which is the spiritual death,
shall deliver up its dead; which
spiritual death is "hell; wherefore,
death and hell must ‘deliver up their
dead, and hell must deliver up its
‘captive ‘spirits, and the grave must
deliver up its captive ‘bodies, and
the bodies and the ¢spirits of men
will be “restored one to the other;
and it is by the power of the res-
urrection of the Holy One of Israel.

13 O how great the “plan of our God!
For on the other hand, the "paradise
of God must deliver up the spirits of
the righteous, and the grave deliver
up the body of the righteous; and
the spirit and the body is ‘restored
to itself again, and all men become
incorruptible, and “immortal, and
they are living souls, having a “per-
fect ‘knowledge like unto us in the
flesh, save it be that our knowledge
shall be perfect.

14 Wherefore, we shall have a “per-
fect ’knowledge of all our ‘guilt,
and our “uncleanness, and our °na-
kedness; and the righteous shall

have a perfect knowledge of their
enjoyment, and their ‘righteousness,
being ‘clothed with "purity, yea,
even with the ‘robe of righteousness.

15 And it shall come to pass that
when all men shall have passed from
this first death unto life, insomuch
as they have become immortal, they
must appear before the *judgment-
seat of the Holy One of Israel; and
then cometh the "judgment, and
then must they be judged according
to the holy judgment of God.

16 And assuredly, as the Lord liveth,
for the Lord God hath spoken it, and
itis his eternal ¢word, which cannot
bypass away, that they who are righ-
teous shall be righteous still, and
they who are ‘filthy shall be “filthy
still; wherefore, they who are filthy
are the ‘devil and his angels; and
they shall go away into ‘everlasting
fire, prepared for them; and their
‘torment is as a "lake of fire and
brimstone, whose flame ascendeth
up forever and ever and has no end.

17 O the greatness and the “justice
of our God! For he executeth all his
words, and they have gone forth
out of his mouth, and his law must
be *fulfilled.

18 But, behold, the “righteous,
the "saints of the Holy One of Is-
rael, they who have believed in the
Holy One of Israel, they who have

74

endured the ‘crosses of the world,
and despised the shame of it, they
shall “inherit the ‘kingdom of God,
which was prepared for them ‘from
the foundation of the world, and
their “joy shall be full "forever.

19 O the greatness of the mercy
of our God, the Holy One of Israel!
For he @delivereth his saints from
that *awful monster the devil, and
death, and ‘hell, and that lake of
fire and brimstone, which is end-
less torment.

20 O how great the “holiness of our
God! For he ’knoweth ‘all things,
and there is not anything save he
knows it.

21 And he cometh into the world
that he may “save all men if they
will hearken unto his voice; for be-
hold, he suffereth the pains of all
men, yea, the "pains of every living
creature, both men, women, and
children, who belong to the fam-
ily of ‘Adam.

22 And he suffereth this that the
resurrection might pass upon all
men, that all might stand before
him at the great and judgment day.

23 And he commandeth all men
that they must “repent, and be
’baptized in his name, having
perfect ‘faith in the Holy One of
Israel, or they cannot be saved in the
kingdom of God.

24 And if they will not repent
and believe in his “name, and be
baptized in his name, and "endure
to the end, they must be ‘damned;
for the Lord God, the Holy One of
Israel, has spoken it.

25 Wherefore, he has given a
“law; and where there is °no ‘law
given there is no “punishment; and
where there is no punishment there
is no condemnation; and where
there is no condemnation the mer-
cies of the Holy One of Israel have
claim upon them, because of the
atonement; for they are delivered
by the power of him.

26 For the “atonement satisfieth
the demands of his "justice upon all
those who ‘have not the “law given
to them, that they are “delivered
from that awful monster, death and
fhell, and the devil, and the lake of
fire and brimstone, which is end-
less torment; and they are restored
to that God who gave them “breath,
which is the Holy One of Israel.

27 But wo unto him that has the
“law given, yea, that has all the
commandments of God, like unto us,
and that °transgresseth them, and

2 NEPHI 9:24-33

that ‘wasteth the days of his ¢pro-
bation, for awful is his state!

28 O that cunning “plan of the evil
one! O the ’vainness, and the frail-
ties, and the ‘foolishness of men!
When they are “learned they think
they are ‘wise, and they ‘hearken not
unto the *counsel of God, for they
set it aside, supposing they know of
themselves, wherefore, their “wis-
dom is foolishness and it profiteth
them not. And they shall perish.

29 But to be “learned is good if
they °hearken unto the ‘counsels of
God.

30 But wo unto the “rich, who are
’rich as to the things of the ‘world.
For because they are rich they de-
spise the “poor, and they persecute
the meek, and their “hearts are upon
their treasures; wherefore, their
‘treasure is their god. And behold,
their *treasure shall perish with
them also.

31 And wo unto the deaf that will
not “hear; for they shall perish.

not see; for they shall perish also.

be thrust down to "hell.

39 O, my beloved brethren, re-
member the awfulness in “trans-
gressing against that Holy God, and
also the awfulness of yielding to
the enticings of that "cunning one.
Remember, to be ‘carnally-minded
is “death, and to be ‘spiritually-
minded is ‘life ‘eternal.

40 O, my beloved brethren, give
ear to my words. Remember the
greatness of the Holy One of Israel.
Do not say that I have spoken hard
things against you; for if ye do, ye
will *revile against the °truth; for
I have spoken the words of your
Maker. I know that the words of truth
are ‘hard against all “uncleanness;
but the ‘righteous fear them not,

 

76

for they love the truth and are not
shaken.

41 O then, my beloved brethren,
“come unto the Lord, the Holy One.
Remember that his paths are righ-
teous, Behold, the "way for man is
‘narrow, but it lieth in a straight
course before him, and the keeper
of the “gate is the Holy One of Is-
rael; and he employeth no servant
there; and there is none other way
save it be by the gate; for he can-
not be deceived, for the Lord God
is his name.

42 And whoso “knocketh, to him
will he open; and the 'wise, and
the learned, and they that are rich,
who are puffed up because of their
‘learning, and their ‘wisdom, and
their riches—yea, they are they
whom he despiseth; and save they
shall cast these things away, and
consider themselves ‘fools before
God, and come down in the depths
of ‘humility, he will not open unto
them.

43 But the things of the wise and
the “prudent shall be "hid from
them forever—yea, that happiness
which is prepared for the saints.

44 0, my beloved brethren, re-
member my words. Behold, I take
off my garments, and I shake them
before you; I pray the God of my
salvation that he view me with his

#all-searching eye; wherefore, ye
shall know at the last day, when
all men shall be judged of their
works, that the God of Israel did
witness that I shook your iniquities
from my soul, and that I stand with
brightness before him, and am ‘rid
of your blood.

45 O, my beloved brethren, turn
away from your sins; shake off the
“chains of him that would bind you
fast; come unto that God who is the
’rock of your salvation.

46 Prepare your souls for that glo-
rious day when “justice shall be ad-
ministered unto the righteous, even
the day of "judgment, that ye may
not shrink with awful fear; that ye
may not remember your awful ‘guilt
in perfectness, and be constrained
to exclaim: Holy, holy are thy judg-
ments, O Lord God “‘Almighty—but
I know my guilt; [transgressed thy
law, and my transgressions are mine;
and the devil hath ‘obtained me,
that lama prey to his awful misery.

47 But behold, my brethren, is it
expedient that I should awake you
to an awful reality of these things?
Would I harrow up your souls if
your minds were pure? Would I
be plain unto you according to the
plainness of the truth if ye were
freed from sin?

48 Behold, if ye were holy I would
speak unto you of holiness; but as
ye are not holy, and ye look upon
me as a “teacher, it must needs be
expedient that I *teach you the con-
sequences of sin.

 

2 NEPHI 9:45-54

49 Behold, my soul abhorreth sin,
and my heart ¢delighteth in righ-
teousness; and I will °praise the holy
name of my God.

50 Come, my brethren, every one
that “thirsteth, come ye to the ’wa-
ters; and he that hath no “money,
come buy and eat; yea, come buy
wine and milk without money and
without price.

51 Wherefore, do not spend money
for that which is of no worth, nor
your “labor for that which cannot
’satisfy. Hearken diligently unto
me, and remember the words which
I have spoken; and come unto the
Holy One of Israel, and ‘feast upon
that which perisheth not, neither
can be corrupted, and let your soul
delight in fatness.

52 Behold, my beloved brethren,
remember the words of your God;
pray unto him continually by day,
and give “thanks unto his holy name
by night. Let your hearts °rejoice.

53 And behold how great the “cov-
enants of the Lord, and how great his
’condescensions unto the children of
men; and because of his greatness,
and his ‘grace and “mercy, he has
promised unto us that our seed shall
not utterly be destroyed, according
to the flesh, but that he would “pre-
serve them; and in future genera-
tions they shall become a righteous
‘branch unto the house of Israel.

54 And now, my brethren, I would
speak unto you more; but on the
morrow I will declare unto you
the remainder of my words. Amen.

CHAPTER 10

Jacob explains that the Jews will crucify
their God—They will be scattered until
they begin to believe in Him—America
will be a land of liberty where no king
will rule—Reconcile yourselves to God
and gain salvation through His grace.
About 559-545 B.C.

AND now I, Jacob, speak unto you
again, my beloved brethren, con-
cerning this righteous “branch of
which I have spoken.

2 For behold, the “promises which
we have obtained are promises unto
us according to the flesh; wherefore,
as it has been shown unto me that
many of our children shall perish
in the flesh because of "unbelief,
nevertheless, God will be merciful
unto many; and our children shall
be ‘restored, that they may come
to that which will give them the
true knowledge of their Redeemer.

3 Wherefore, as I said unto you,
it must needs be expedient that
Christ—for in the last night the “an-
gel spake unto me that this should
be his name—should ’come among
the ‘Jews, among those who are the
more wicked part of the world; and
they shall “crucify him—for thus
it behooveth our God, and there
is none other nation on earth that
would ‘crucify their ‘God.

4 For should the mighty “miracles
be wrought among other nations
they would repent, and know that
he be their God.

 

78

5 But because of “priestcrafts and
iniquities, they at Jerusalem will
‘stiffen their necks against him,
that he be ‘crucified.

6 Wherefore, because of their in-
iquities, destructions, famines, “pes-
tilences, and bloodshed shall come
upon them; and they who shall not
be destroyed shall be ’scattered
among all nations.

7 But behold, thus saith the “Lord
God: "When the day cometh that
they shall believe in me, that I
am Christ, then have I covenanted
with their fathers that they shall
be ‘restored in the flesh, upon
the earth, unto the “lands of their
inheritance.

8 And it shall come to pass that
they shall be “gathered in from
their long dispersion, from the
bisles of the sea, and from the four
parts of the earth; and the nations
of the Gentiles shall be great in the
eyes of me, saith God, in ‘carrying
them forth to the lands of their
inheritance.

9 “Yea, the kings of the Gentiles
shall be nursing fathers unto them,
and their queens shall become nurs-
ing mothers; wherefore, the prom-
ises of the Lord are great unto the
Gentiles, for he hath spoken it, and
who can dispute?

10 But behold, this land, said God,
shall be a land of thine inheritance,
and the “Gentiles shall be blessed
upon the land.

11 And this land shall be a land of

“liberty unto the Gentiles, and there
shall be no ’kings upon the land,
who shall raise up unto the Gentiles.

12 And I will fortify this land
“against all other nations.

13 And he that “fighteth against
Zion shall °perish, saith God.

14 For he that raiseth up a “king
against me shall perish, for I, the
Lord, the "king of heaven, will be
their king, and I will be a ‘light unto
them forever, that hear my words.

15 Wherefore, for this cause, that
my “covenants may be fulfilled
which I have made unto the children
of men, that I will do unto them
while they are in the flesh, I must
needs destroy the "secret works of
‘darkness, and of murders, and of
abominations,

16 Wherefore, he that “fighteth
against °Zion, both Jew and Gen-
tile, both bond and free, both male
and female, ‘shall perish; for ‘they
are they who are the ‘whore of all
the earth; for ‘they who are ‘not for
me are “against me, saith our God.

17 For I will “fulfil my "promises
which I have made unto the chil-
dren of men, that I will do unto
them while they are in the flesh—

18 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, thus saith our God: I will afflict
thy seed by the hand of the Gen-

 

2 NEPHI 10:12-22

tiles; nevertheless, I will “soften
the hearts of the "Gentiles, that
they shall be like unto a father to
them; wherefore, the Gentiles shall
be ‘blessed and ‘numbered among
the house of Israel.

19 Wherefore, I will ¢consecrate
this land unto thy seed, and them
who shall be numbered among thy
seed, forever, for the land of their
inheritance; for it is a choice land,
saith God unto me, above all other
lands, wherefore I will have all men
that dwell thereon that they shall
worship me, saith God.

20 And now, my beloved brethren,
seeing that our merciful God has
given us so great knowledge con-
cerning these things, let us remem-
ber him, and lay aside our sins, and
not hang down our heads, for we are
not cast off; nevertheless, we have
been @driven out of the land of our
inheritance; but we have been led
to a "better land, for the Lord has
made the sea our “path, and we are
upon an “isle of the sea.

21 But great are the promises of
the Lord unto them who are upon
the “isles of the sea; wherefore as it
says isles, there must needs be more
than this, and they are inhabited
also by our brethren.

Jacob saw his Redeemer—The law of
Moses typifies Christ and proves He
will come. About 559-545 B.c.

caused to be ’written, for the things
which I have written sufficeth me.

2 And now I, Nephi, write *more
of the words of "Isaiah, for my soul
delighteth in his words. For I will
liken his words unto my people,
and I will send them forth unto
all my children, for he verily ‘saw
my “Redeemer, even as I have seen
him,

3 And my brother, Jacob, also
has “seen him as I have seen him;
wherefore, I will send their words
forth unto my children to prove
unto them that my words are true.
Wherefore, by the words of three,
God hath said, I will establish my
word. Nevertheless, God sendeth
more ‘witnesses, and he proveth
all his words.

4 Behold, my soul delighteth in
“proving unto my people the truth
of the "coming of Christ; for, for
this end hath the ‘law of Moses
been given; and all things which
have been given of God from the
beginning of the world, unto man,
are the “typifying of him.

5 And also my soul delighteth in
the “covenants of the Lord which
he hath made to our fathers; yea,
my soul delighteth in his ’grace,
and in his justice, and power, and
mercy in the great and eternal plan
of ‘deliverance from death.

ing unto my people that “save Christ

8 And now I write “some of the
words of Isaiah, that whoso of my
people shall see these words may
lift up their hearts and rejoice for
all men. Now these are the words,
and ye may liken them unto you
and unto all men.

CHAPTER 12

Isaiah sees the latter-day temple, gath-
ering of Israel, and millennial judgment
and peace—The proud and wicked will
be brought low at the Second Coming—
Compare Isaiah 2. About 559-545 B.c.

“THE word that Isaiah, the son of
Amoz, saw concerning Judah and
Jerusalem:

2 And it shall come to pass in the
last days, “when the ’mountain of
the Lord’s “house shall be estab-
lished in the top of the ¢mountains,
and shall be exalted above the hills,
and all nations shall flow unto it.

3 And many “people shall go and
say, Come ye, and let us go up to
the ’mountain of the Lord, to the
‘house of the God of Jacob; and he
will teach us of his ways, and we
will ‘walk in his paths; for out of
Zion shall go forth the law, and the
word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

4 And he shall *judge among the
nations, and shall rebuke many
people: and they shall beat their

 

2 NEPHI 11:8-12:12

swords into plow-shares, and their
spears into pruning-hooks—nation
shall not lift up sword against na-
tion, neither shall they learn war
any more.

5 Ohouse of Jacob, come ye and let
us walk in the light of the Lord; yea,
come, for ye have all “gone astray,
every one to his °wicked ways.

6 Therefore, O Lord, thou hast
forsaken thy people, the house of
Jacob, because they be replenished
from the east, and hearken unto
“soothsayers like the ’Philistines,
and they please themselves in the
children of strangers.

7 Their land also is full of silver
and gold, neither is there any end
of their “treasures; their land is also
full of horses, neither is there any
end of their chariots.

8 Their land is also full of “idols;
they worship the work of their own
hands, that which their own fingers
have made.

9 And the mean man “boweth not
down, and the great man humbleth
himself not, therefore, forgive him
not.

10 O ye wicked ones, enter into the
rock, and “hide thee in the dust, for
the fear of the Lord and the glory
of his majesty shall smite thee.

11 And it shall come to pass that
the “lofty looks of man shall be hum-
bled, and the haughtiness of men
shall be bowed down, and the Lord
alone shall be exalted in that day.

Hosts soon cometh upon all nations,

’proud and lofty, and upon every
one who is lifted up, and he shall
be brought low.

13 Yea, and the day of the Lord
shall come upon all the “cedars
of Lebanon, for they are high and
lifted up; and upon all the oaks of
Bashan;

14 And upon all the “high moun-
tains, and upon all the hills, and
upon all the nations which are lifted
up, and upon every people;

15 And upon every “high tower,
and upon every fenced wall;

16 And upon all the ships of the “sea,
and upon all the ships of Tarshish,
and upon all pleasant pictures.

17 And the loftiness of man shall
be bowed down, and the “haughti-
ness of men shall be made low; and
the Lord alone shall be exalted in

18 And the idols he shall utterly
abolish.

19 And they shall go into the holes
of the rocks, and into the caves of the
earth, for the fear of the Lord shall
come upon them and the “glory of his
majesty shall smite them, when he
ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

20 In that day a man shall cast
his idols of silver, and his idols of
gold, which he hath made for him-
self to worship, to the moles and to
the bats;

and into the tops of the ragged rocks,

CHAPTER 13

Judah and Jerusalem will be punished
for their disobedience—The Lord pleads
for and judges His people—The daugh-
ters of Zion are cursed and tormented
for their worldliness—Compare Isaiah
3. About 559-545 B.c.

“FOR behold, the Lord, the Lord of
Hosts, doth take away from Jerusa-
lem, and from Judah, the stay and
the staff, the whole staff of bread,
and the whole stay of water—

2 The *mighty man, and the man
of ’war, the judge, and the prophet,
and the ‘prudent, and the ancient;

3 The captain of fifty, and the
honorable man, and the counselor,
and the cunning artificer, and the
eloquent orator.

4 And I will give children unto
them to be their princes, and babes
shall rule over them.

5 And the people shall be 4op-
pressed, every one by another,
and every one by his neighbor; the
child shall behave himself *proudly
against the ancient, and the base
against the honorable.

6 When a man shall take hold of his
brother of the house of his father,
and shall say: Thou hast clothing,
be thou our ruler, and let not this
“ruin come under thy hand—

7 In that day shall he swear, say-
ing: I will not be a healer; for in my
house there is neither bread nor

‘tongues and their doings have
been against the Lord, to “provoke
the eyes of his glory.

9 The show of their countenance
doth witness against them, and
doth declare their “sin to be even
as "Sodom, and they cannot hide it.
Wo unto their souls, for they have
rewarded evil unto themselves!

10 Say unto the righteous that it is
“well with them; for they shall "eat
the fruit of their doings.

11 Wo unto the wicked, for they
shall perish; for the reward of their
hands shall be upon them!

12 And my people, children are
their oppressors, and women rule
over them. O my people, they who
“lead thee cause thee to err and de-
stroy the way of thy paths.

13 The Lord standeth up to “plead,
and standeth to judge the people.

14 The Lord will enter into *judg-
ment with the ancients of his peo-
ple and the princes thereof; for ye
have eaten up the vineyard and the
spoil of the ‘poor in your houses.

15 What mean ye? Ye “beat my
people to pieces, and grind the
faces of the poor, saith the Lord
God of Hosts.

16 Moreover, the Lord saith: Be-
cause the daughters of Zion are
“haughty, and ’walk with stretched-
forth necks and wanton eyes, walk-
ing and mincing as they go, and
making a tinkling with their feet—

17 Therefore the Lord will smite
with a *scab the crown of the head
of the daughters of Zion, and the
Lord will 'discover their secret
parts.

 

2 NEPHI 13:9-14:2

18 In that “day the Lord will take
away the bravery of their tinkling
ornaments, and cauls, and round
tires like the moon;

19 The chains and the bracelets,
and the mufflers;

20 The bonnets, and the ornaments
of the legs, and the headbands, and
the tablets, and the ear-rings;

21 The rings, and nose jewels;

22 The changeable suits of apparel,
and the mantles, and the wimples,
and the crisping-pins;

23 The glasses, and the fine linen,
and hoods, and the veils.

24 And it shall come to pass, in-
stead of sweet smell there shall be
stink; and instead of a girdle, a rent;
and instead of well set hair, “bald-
ness; and instead of a stomacher, a
girding of sackcloth; "burning in-
stead of ‘beauty.

25 Thy men shall fall by the sword
and thy mighty in the war.

26 And her “gates shall lament and
’mourn; and she shall be desolate,
and shall ‘sit upon the ground.

CHAPTER 14

Zion and her daughters will be redeemed
and cleansed in the millennial day—
Compare Isaiah 4. About 559-545 B.C.

“AND in that day, seven women shall

will eat our own bread, and wear

3 And it shall come to pass, they
that are “left in Zion and remain in
Jerusalem shall be called holy, ev-
ery one that is written among the
living in Jerusalem—

4 When the Lord shall have washed
away the filth of the daughters of
Zion, and shall have purged the
blood of Jerusalem from the midst
thereof by the spirit of judgment
and by the spirit of "burning.

5 And the “Lord will create upon
every dwelling-place of mount Zion,
and upon her assemblies, a °cloud
and smoke by day and the shining of
a flaming fire by night; for upon all
the glory of Zion shall be a defence.

6 And there shall be a tabernacle
for a shadow in the daytime from the
heat, and fora place of “refuge, and
a covert from storm and from rain.

CHAPTER 15

The Lord’s vineyard (Israel) will be-
come desolate, and His people will
be scattered—Woes will come upon
them in their apostate and scattered
state—The Lord will lift an ensign
and gather Israel—Compare Isaiah 5.
About 559-545 B.c.

“AND then will I sing to my well-
beloved a song of my beloved, touch-
ing his °vineyard. My well-beloved
hatha vineyard ina very fruitful hill.

2 And he fenced it, and gathered
out the stones thereof, and planted
it with the choicest “vine, and built
a tower in the midst of it, and also
made a wine-press therein; and he
looked that it should bring forth
grapes, and it brought forth wild
grapes.

 

84

3 And now, O inhabitants of
Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge,
I pray you, betwixt me and my
vineyard.

4 What could have been done
more to my vineyard that I have
not done in it? Wherefore, when
I looked that it should bring forth
grapes it brought forth wild grapes.

5 And now go to; I will tell you
what I will do to my vineyard—I
will “take away the hedge thereof,
and it shall be eaten up; and I will
break down the wall thereof, and
it shall be trodden down;

6 And I will lay it waste; it shall
not be pruned nor digged; but there
shall come up “briers and thorns; I
will also command the clouds that
they "rain no rain upon it.

7 For the vineyard of the Lord of
Hosts is the house of Israel, and the
men of Judah his pleasant plant;
and he looked for "judgment, and
behold, ‘oppression; for righteous-
ness, but behold, a cry.

8 Wo unto them that join “house
to house, till there can be no place,
that they may be placed alone in
the midst of the earth!

9In mine ears, said the Lord of
Hosts, of a truth many houses shall
be desolate, and great and fair cit-
ies without inhabitant.

10 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall
yield one “bath, and the seed of a
homer shall yield an ephah.

11 Wo unto them that rise up
early in the morning, that they may
“follow strong drink, that continue
until night, and "wine inflame
them!

12 And the harp, and the “viol, the

their feasts; but they °regard not

the work of the Lord, neither con-
sider the operation of his hands.

13 Therefore, my people are gone
into “captivity, because they have
no "knowledge; and their honorable
men are famished, and their mul-
titude dried up with thirst.

14 Therefore, hell hath enlarged her-
self, and opened her mouth without
measure; and their glory, and their
multitude, and their pomp, and he
that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.

15 And the mean man shall be
“brought down, and the ’mighty
man shall be humbled, and the
eyes of the ‘lofty shall be humbled.

16 But the Lord of Hosts shall be
exalted in “judgment, and God that
is holy shall be sanctified in righ-
teousness,

17 Then shall the lambs feed after
their manner, and the waste places
of the “fat ones shall strangers eat.

18 Wo unto them that draw iniq-
uity with cords of ¢vanity, and sin
as it were with a cart rope;

19 That say: Let him ¢“make speed,
bhasten his work, that we may ‘see
it; and let the counsel of the Holy
One of Israel draw nigh and come,
that we may know it.

20 Wo unto them that ¢call "evil
good, and good evil, that put “‘dark-
ness for light, and light for dark-
ness, that put bitter for sweet, and
sweet for bitter!

21 Wo unto the “wise in their own
eyes and ’prudent in their own sight!

22 Wo unto the mighty to drink
*wine, and men of strength to min-
gle strong drink;

 

2 NEPHI 15:13-30

23 Who justify the wicked for “re-
ward, and take away the righteous-
ness of the righteous from him!

24 Therefore, as the “fire devoureth
the stubble, and the flame con-
sumeth the ‘chaff, their ¢root shall
be rottenness, and their blossoms
shall go up as dust; because they
have cast away the law of the Lord
of Hosts, and ‘despised the word of
the Holy One of Israel.

25 Therefore, is the “anger of the
Lord kindled against his people,
and he hath stretched forth his
hand against them, and hath smit-
ten them; and the hills did trem-
ble, and their carcasses were torn
in the midst of the streets, For all
this his anger is not turned away,
but his hand is stretched out still.

26 And he will lift up an “ensign
to the ’nations from far, and will
hiss unto them from the ‘end of the
earth; and behold, they shall ¢come
with speed swiftly; none shall be
weary nor stumble among them.

27 None shall slumber nor sleep;
neither shall the girdle of their
loins be loosed, nor the latchet of
their shoes be broken;

28 Whose arrows shall be sharp,
and all their bows bent, and their
horses’ hoofs shall be counted like
flint, and their wheels like a whirl-
wind, their roaring like a lion.

29 They shall roar like young @li-
ons; yea, they shall roar, and lay
hold of the prey, and shall carry
away safe, and none shall deliver.

30 And in that “day they shall roar
against them like the roaring of the

CHAPTER 16

Isaiah sees the Lord—Isaiah’s sins are
forgiven—He is called to prophesy—
He prophesies of the rejection by the
Jews of Christ’s teachings—A remnant
will return—Compare Isaiah 6. About
559-545 B.C.

“IN the °year that king Uzziah died,
I ‘saw also the Lord sitting upon a
throne, high and lifted up, and his
train filled the temple.

2 Above it stood the “seraphim; each
one had six wings; with twain he
covered his face, and with twain
he covered his feet, and with twain he
did fly.

3 And one cried unto another, and
said: Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord
of Hosts; the whole earth is full of
his “glory.

4 And the posts of the door moved
at the voice of him that cried, and
the house was filled with smoke.

5 Then said I: Wo is unto me! for
lam undone; because I am a man
of unclean lips; and I dwell in the
midst of a people of unclean lips;
for mine eyes have “seen the King,
the Lord of Hosts.

6 Then flew one of the seraphim
unto me, having a live coal in his
hand, which he had taken with the
tongs from off the altar;

7 And he laid it upon my mouth,
and said: Lo, this has touched thy
lips; and thine “iniquity is taken
away, and thy sin purged.

8 Also I heard the voice of the
Lord, saying: “Whom shall I send,
and who will go for us? Then I said:
Here am I; send me.

 

86

9 And he said: Go and tell this
people—Hear ye indeed, but they
understood not; and see ye indeed,
but they perceived not.

10 Make the heart of this people
fat, and make their ears heavy,
and shut their eyes—lest they see
with their eyes, and “hear with
their ears, and understand with their
bheart, and be converted and be
healed.

11 Then said I: Lord, how long?
And he said: Until the cities be
wasted without inhabitant, and the
houses without man, and the land
be utterly desolate;

12 And the Lord have “removed
men far away, for there shall be
a great forsaking in the midst of
the land.

13 But yet there shall be a tenth,
and they shall return, and shall be
eaten, as a teil tree, and as an oak
whose substance is in them when
they cast their leaves; so the “holy
seed shall be the substance thereof.

CHAPTER 17

Ephraim and Syria wage war against
Judah—Christ will be born of a virgin—
Compare Isaiah 7. About 559-545 B.c.

4AND it came to pass in the days of
’Ahaz the son of ‘Jotham, the son of
Uzziah, king of Judah, that “Rezin,
king of Syria, and “Pekah the son of
Remaliah, king of Israel, went up
toward Jerusalem to war against
it, but could not prevail against it.

2 And it was told the house of
David, saying: Syria is confederate
with Ephraim. And his heart was
moved, and the heart of his people,
as the trees of the wood are moved
with the wind.

3 Then said the Lord unto Isaiah:

and Shearjashub thy son, at the end
of the “conduit of the upper pool
in the highway of the fuller’s field;

4 And say unto him: Take heed,
and be quiet; fear not, neither be
faint-hearted for the two tails of
these smoking firebrands, for the
fierce anger of Rezin with Syria,
and of the son of Remaliah.

5 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the
son of Remaliah, have taken evil
counsel against thee, saying:

6 Let us go up against Judah and
vex it, and let us make a breach
therein for us, and set a king in the
midst of it, yea, the son of Tabeal.

7 Thus saith the Lord God: It shall
not stand, neither shall it come to
pass.

8 For the head of Syria is Damas-
cus, and the head of Damascus,
Rezin; and within threescore and
five years shall Ephraim be “broken
that it be not a people.

9 And the head of Ephraim is
Samaria, and the head of Samaria
is Remaliah’s son. If ye will ¢not
believe surely ye shall not be es-
tablished.

10 Moreover, the Lord spake again
unto Ahaz, saying:

11 Ask thee a ¢sign of the Lord thy
God; ask it either in the depths, or
in the heights above.

12 But Ahaz said: I will not ask,
neither will I *tempt the Lord.

13 And he said: Hear ye now, O
house of David; is it a small thing
for you to weary men, but will ye
weary my God also?

14 Therefore, the Lord himself shall
give you a sign—Behold, a “virgin
shall conceive, and shall bear a son,
and shall call his name "Immanuel.

15 Butter and “honey shall he eat,
that he may know to refuse the evil
and to choose the good.

16 For “before the child shall know

 

2 NEPHI 17:4-25

to refuse the evil and choose the
good, the land that thou abhorrest
shall be forsaken of *both her kings.

17 The Lord shall “bring upon thee,
and upon thy people, and upon thy
father’s house, days that have not
come from the day that "Ephraim
departed from Judah, the king of
Assyria.

18 And it shall come to pass in
that day that the Lord shall hiss
for the fly that is in the uttermost
part of Egypt, and for the bee that
is in the land of Assyria.

19 And they shall come, and shall
rest all of them in the desolate val-
leys, and in the holes of the rocks,
and upon all thorns, and upon all
bushes.

20 In the same day shall the Lord
shave with a “razor that is hired,
by them beyond the river, by the
king of Assyria, the head, and the
hair of the feet; and it shall also
consume the beard.

21 And it shall come to pass in that
day, a man shall nourish a young
cow and two sheep;

22 And it shall come to pass, for
the abundance of milk they shall
give he shall eat butter; for butter
and honey shall every one eat that
is left in the land.

23 And it shall come to pass in
that day, every place shall be, where
there were a thousand vines at a
thousand silverlings, which shall
be for briers and thorns.

24 With arrows and with bows
shall men come thither, because
all the land shall become briers
and thorns.

25 And all hills that shall be digged
with the mattock, there shall not
come thither the fear of briers and
thorns; but it shall be for the send-
ing forth of oxen, and the treading
of lesser cattle.

CHAPTER 18

Christ will be as a stone of stumbling
and a rock of offense—Seek the Lord,
not peeping wizards—Turn to the law
and to the testimony for guidance—
Compare Isaiah 8. About 559-545 B.c.

MOREOVER, the word of the Lord
said unto me: Take thee a great @roll,
and write in it with a man’s pen,
concerning ’Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

2 And I took unto me faithful
4witnesses to record, Uriah the
priest, and Zechariah the son of
Jeberechiah.

3 And I went unto the prophetess;
and she conceived and bare a son.
Then said the Lord to me: ¢Call his
name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

4 For behold, “the child shall ’not
have knowledge to cry, My father,
and my mother, before the riches
of Damascus and the ‘spoil of 4Sa-
maria shall be taken away before
the king of ‘Assyria.

5 The Lord spake also unto me
again, saying:

6 Forasmuch as this people refus-
eth the waters of *Shiloah that go
softly, and rejoice in "Rezin and
Remaliah’s son;

7 Now therefore, behold, the Lord
bringeth up upon them the waters
of the river, strong and many, even
the king of “Assyria and all his glory;
and he shall come up over all his
channels, and go over all his banks.

8 And he shall pass through Ju-
dah; he shall overflow and go over,
he shall “reach even to the neck;
and the stretching out of his wings
shall fill the breadth of thy land,
O Immanuel.

 

88

9 “Associate yourselves, O ye
people, and ye shall be broken in
pieces; and give ear all ye of far
countries; gird yourselves, and ye
shall be broken in pieces; gird your-
selves, and ye shall be broken in
pieces.

10 Take counsel together, and it
shall come to naught; speak the
word, and it shall not stand; for
God is with us.

11 For the Lord spake thus to me
with a strong hand, and instructed
me that I should not walk in the
way of this people, saying:

12 Say ye not, A confederacy, to
all to whom this people shall say, A
“confederacy; neither fear ye their
fear, nor be afraid.

13 Sanctify the Lord of Hosts him-
self, and let him be your fear, and
let him be your dread.

14 And he shall be for a sanctuary;
but for a “stone of "stumbling, and
for a ‘rock of “offense to both the
houses of Israel, for a gin and a “snare
to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

15 And many among them shall
“stumble and fall, and be broken,
and be snared, and be taken.

16 “Bind up the testimony, seal the
law among my disciples.

17 And I will wait upon the Lord,
that “hideth his face from the house
of Jacob, and I will look for him.

18 Behold, I and the children
whom the Lord hath given me are
for “signs and for wonders in Is-
rael from the Lord of Hosts, which
dwelleth in Mount Zion.

that peep and mutter—‘should not
a people seek unto their God for
the living to hear from the dead?

20 To the “law and to the testi-
mony; and if they speak not ac-
cording to this word, it is because
there is no light in them.

21 And they shall pass through it
hardly bestead and hungry; and it
shall come to pass that when they
shall be hungry, they shall fret
themselves, and curse their king
and their God, and look upward.

22 And they shall look unto the
earth and behold trouble, and “dark-
ness, dimness of anguish, and shall
be driven to darkness.

CHAPTER 19

Isaiah speaks messianically—The peo-
ple in darkness will see a great light—
Unto us a child is born—He will be
the Prince of Peace and will reign on
David’s throne—Compare Isaiah 9.
About 559-545 B.C.

4NEVERTHELESS, the dimness shall
not be such as was in her vexation,
when at first he lightly afflicted the
bland of ‘Zebulun, and the land of
4Naphtali, and afterwards did more
grievously afflict by the way of the
Red Sea beyond Jordan in Galilee
of the nations.

2 The people that walked in dark-
ness have seen a great light; they
that dwell in the land of the shadow
of death, upon them hath the light
shined.

3 Thou hast multiplied the nation,
and “increased the joy—they joy
before thee according to the joy in
harvest, and as men rejoice when
they divide the spoil.

 

2 NEPHI 18:20-19:14

4 For thou hast broken the yoke
of “his burden, and the staff of his
shoulder, the rod of his "oppressor.

5 For every battle of the warrior is
with confused noise, and garments
rolled in blood; but “this shall be
with burning and fuel of fire.

6 For unto us a “child is born, unto
us a son is given; and the °govern-
ment shall be upon his shoulder;
and his name shall be called, Won-
derful, Counselor, The “Mighty God,
The “Everlasting Father, The Prince
of “Peace.

7 Of the increase of “government
and peace ’there is no end, upon
the throne of ‘David, and upon his
kingdom to order it, and to estab-
lish it with judgment and with jus-
tice from henceforth, even forever.
The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will
perform this.

8 The Lord sent his word unto Ja-
cob and it hath lighted upon Israel.

9 And all the people shall know,
even Ephraim and the inhabitants
of Samaria, that say in the pride
and stoutness of heart:

10 The bricks are fallen down, but
we will build with hewn “stones;
the sycamores are cut down, but
we will change them into °cedars.

11 Therefore the Lord shall set up
the adversaries of “Rezin against
him, and join his enemies together;

12 The Syrians before and the Phi-
listines behind; and they shall ¢de-
vour Israel with open mouth. For all
this his "anger is not turned away,
but his hand is stretched out still.

13 For the people turneth not unto
“him that smiteth them, neither do
they seek the Lord of Hosts.

14 Therefore will the Lord cut off

from Israel head and tail, branch
and rush “in one day.

15 The “ancient, he is the head;
and the prophet that teacheth lies,
he is the tail.

16 For the “leaders of this people
cause them to err; and they that are
*led of them are destroyed.

17 Therefore the Lord shall have
no joy in their young men, neither
shall have “mercy on their fatherless
and >widows; for “every one of them
isa hypocrite and an “evildoer, and
every mouth speaketh “folly. For all
this his anger is not turned away,
but his ‘hand is stretched out still.

18 For “wickedness burneth as
the fire; it shall devour the briers
and thorns, and shall kindle in the
thickets of the forests, and they
shall mount up like the lifting up
of smoke.

19 Through the wrath of the Lord
of Hosts is the “land darkened, and
the people shall be as the fuel of the
fire; °no man shall spare his brother,

20 And he “shall snatch on the right
hand and be hungry; and he shall
beat on the left hand and they shall
not be satisfied; they shall eat ev-
ery man the flesh of his own arm—

21 Manasseh, “Ephraim; and
Ephraim, Manasseh; they together
shall be against °Judah. For all this
his anger is not turned away, but
his hand is stretched out still.

CHAPTER 20

The destruction of Assyria is a type
of the destruction of the wicked at the

 

Second Coming—Few people will be left

90

after the Lord comes again—The rem-
nant of Jacob will return in that day—
Compare Isaiah 10. About 559-545 B.c.

#Wo unto them that decree °un-
righteous decrees, and that write
grievousness which they have pre-
scribed;

2 To turn away the needy from
judgment, and to take away the
right from the “poor of my people,
that widows may be their prey, and
that they may rob the fatherless!

3 And what will ye do in the day
of visitation, and in the desolation
which shall come from far? to whom
will ye flee for help? and where will
ye leave your glory?

4 Without me they shall bow down
under the prisoners, and they shall
fall under the slain. For all this his
anger is not turned away, but his
hand is stretched out still.

5 O Assyrian, the rod of mine an-
ger, and the staff in their hand is
“their indignation.

6 I will send him 4against a hypo-
critical nation, and against the
people of my wrath will I give him
a charge to take the spoil, and to
take the prey, and to tread them
down like the mire of the streets.

7 Howbeit he meaneth not so, nei-
ther doth his heart think so; but in
his heart it is to destroy and cut off
nations not a few.

8 For he saith: Are not my “princes
altogether kings?

9 Is not *Calno as °Carchemish?

kingdoms of the idols, and whose
graven images did excel them of
Jerusalem and of Samaria;

11 Shall I not, as I have done unto
Samaria and her idols, so do to Je-
rusalem and to her idols?

12 Wherefore it shall come to pass
that when the Lord hath performed
his whole work upon Mount Zion
and upon Jerusalem, I will punish
the fruit of the stout heart of the
king of “Assyria, and the glory of
his high looks.

13 For “he saith: By the strength
of ’my hand and by my wisdom I
have done these things; for I am
prudent; and I have moved the bor-
ders of the people, and have robbed
their treasures, and I have put down
the inhabitants like a valiant man;

14 And my hand hath found asa
nest the riches of the people; and
as one gathereth eggs that are left
have I gathered all the earth; and
there was none that moved the wing,
or opened the mouth, or peeped.

15 Shall the “ax boast itself against
him that heweth therewith? Shall
the saw magnify itself against him
that shaketh it? As if the rod should
shake itself against them that lift it
up, or as if the staff should lift up
itself as if it were no wood!

16 Therefore shall the Lord, the
Lord of Hosts, send among his fat
ones, leanness; and under his glory
he shall kindle a burning like the
burning of a fire.

17 And the light of Israel shall be for
a “fire, and his Holy One for a flame,
and shall burn and shall devour his
thorns and his briers in one day;

 

2 NEPHI 20:11-26

18 And shall consume the glory
of his forest, and of his fruitful
field, both soul and body; and they
shall be as when a standard-bearer
fainteth.

19 And the “rest of the trees of
his forest shall be few, that a child
may write them.

20 And it shall come to pass in that
day, that the remnant of Israel, and
such as are escaped of the “house
of Jacob, shall no more again °stay
upon him that smote them, but
shall stay upon the Lord, the Holy
One of Israel, in truth.

21 The “remnant shall return, yea,
even the remnant of Jacob, unto the
mighty God.

22 For though thy people Israel
be as the sand of the sea, yet a rem-
nant of them shall ’return; the ‘con-
sumption decreed shall overflow
with righteousness.

23 For the Lord God of Hosts shall
make a “consumption, even deter-
mined in all the land.

24 Therefore, thus saith the Lord
God of Hosts: O my people that
dwellest in Zion, “be not afraid of
the Assyrian; he shall smite thee
with a rod, and shall lift up his
staff against thee, after the "man-
ner of Egypt.

25 For yet a very little while, and
the “indignation shall cease, and
mine anger in their destruction.

26 And the Lord of Hosts shall ¢stir
up a scourge for him according to
the slaughter of "Midian at the rock
of Oreb; and as his rod was upon
the sea so shall he lift it up after
the manner of ‘Egypt.

4AND there shall °come forth a rod
out of the ‘stem of Jesse, and a
“branch shall grow out of his roots.

2 And the “Spirit of the Lord shall
rest upon him, the spirit of °wis-
dom and ‘understanding, the spirit
of counsel and might, the spirit of
knowledge and of the fear of the
Lord;

3 And shall make him of quick
understanding in the fear of the
Lord; and he shall not “judge after
the sight of his eyes, neither reprove
after the hearing of his ears.

4 But with “righteousness shall he
>judge the poor, and reprove with
equity for the ‘meek of the earth;
and he shall “smite the earth with
the ‘rod of his mouth, and with the
breath of his lips shall he slay the
wicked.

5 And “righteousness shall be the
girdle of his loins, and faithfulness
the girdle of his reins.

6 The “wolf also shall dwell with
the lamb, and the leopard shall lie
down with the kid, and the calf and
the young lion and fatling together;
and a little child shall lead them.

7 And the cow and the bear shall
feed; their young ones shall lie

8 And the sucking child shall play

weaned child shall put his hand

10 And in that day there shall be
a *root of Jesse, which shall stand
for an ensign of the people; to it
shall the "Gentiles seek; and his
‘rest shall be glorious.

11 And it shall come to pass in
that day that the Lord shall set his
hand again the “second time to re-
cover the remnant of his people
which shall be left, from "Assyria,
and from Egypt, and from Pathros,
and from Cush, and from Elam, and
from ‘Shinar, and from Hamath,
and from the islands of the sea.

12 And he shall set up an “ensign
for the nations, and shall assemble
the outcasts of Israel, and ‘gather
together the dispersed of Judah
from the four corners of the earth.

13 The “envy of Ephraim also shall
depart, and the adversaries of Judah
shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not
benvy ‘Judah, and Judah shall not
vex Ephraim.

14 But they shall fly upon the
shoulders of the “Philistines towards
the west; they shall spoil them of
the east together; they shall lay
their hand upon "Edom and “Moab;
and the children of Ammon shall
obey them.

15 And the Lord shall utterly “de-
stroy the tongue of the Egyptian
sea; and with his mighty wind
he shall shake his hand over the
river, and shall smite it in the seven
streams, and make men go over *dry
shod.

 

2 NEPHI 21:10-22:6

16 And there shall be a “highway
for the remnant of his people which
shall be left, from Assyria, like as
it was to Israel in the day that he
came up out of the land of Egypt.

CHAPTER 22

In the millennial day all men will praise
the Lord—He will dwell among them—
Compare Isaiah 12. About 559-545 B.C.

"AND in that day thou shalt say:
O Lord, I will praise thee; though
thou wast angry with me thine an-
ger is turned away, and thou com-
fortedst me.

2 Behold, God is my salvation; I
will “trust, and not be afraid; for
the Lord "JEHOVAH is my ‘strength
and my “song; he also has become
my salvation.

3 Therefore, with joy shall ye draw
*water out of the wells of salvation.

4 And in that day shall ye say:
“Praise the Lord, call upon his name,
declare his doings among the peo-
ple, make mention that his name
is exalted.

5 *Sing unto the Lord; for he hath
done excellent things; this is known
in all the earth.

6 *Cry out and shout, thou inhabi-
tant of Zion; for great is the Holy
One of Israel in the midst of thee.

—Babylon (the world) will fall forever—
Compare Isaiah 13. About 559-545 B.c.

“THE burden of "Babylon, which
Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

2 Lift ye up a banner upon the
high mountain, exalt the voice unto
them, “shake the hand, that they
may go into the gates of the nobles.

3 [have commanded my sanctified
ones, I have also called my “mighty
ones, for mine anger is not upon
them that rejoice in my highness.

4 The noise of the multitude in
the mountains like as of a great
people, a tumultuous noise of the
“kingdoms of nations "gathered to-
gether, the Lord of Hosts mustereth
the hosts of the battle.

5 They come from a far country,
from the end of heaven, yea, the
Lord, and the weapons of his indig-
nation, to destroy the whole land.

6 Howl ye, for the “day of the Lord
is at hand; it shall come as a de-
struction from the Almighty.

7 Therefore shall all hands be
faint, every man’s heart shall “melt;

8 And they shall be afraid; pangs
and sorrows shall take hold of them;
they shall be amazed one at another;
their faces shall be as flames.

9 Behold, the day of the Lord
cometh, cruel both with wrath and
fierce anger, to lay the land deso-
late; and he shall ¢destroy the sin-
ners thereof out of it.

10 For the “stars of heaven and
the ’constellations thereof shall not
give their ‘light; the “sun shall be
darkened in his going forth, and

 

94

the moon shall not cause her light
to shine.

11 And I will *punish the world
for evil, and the ’wicked for their
iniquity; I will cause the arrogancy
of the ‘proud to cease, and will lay
down the haughtiness of the terrible.

12 I will make a “man more pre-
cious than fine gold; even a man
than the golden wedge of Ophir.

13 Therefore, I will *shake the
heavens, and the earth shall °re-
move out of her place, in the wrath
of the Lord of Hosts, and in the day
of his fierce anger.

14 And it shall be as the chased roe,
and as a sheep that no man taketh
up; and they shall every man turn
to his own people, and flee every
one into his own “land.

15 Every one that is proud shall
be thrust through; yea, and every
one that is “joined to the wicked
shall fall by the sword.

16 Their “children also shall be
’dashed to pieces before their eyes;
their houses shall be spoiled and
their wives ravished.

17 Behold, I will stir up the “Medes
against them, which shall not re-
gard silver and gold, nor shall they
delight in it.

18 Their bows shall also dash the
young men to pieces; and they shall
have no “pity on the fruit of the
womb; their eyes shall not spare
children.

19 And “Babylon, the glory of king-

excellency, shall be as when God

“FoR the Lord will have mercy on

and set them in their own land; and
the ‘strangers shall be joined with
them, and they shall cleave to the
house of Jacob.

2 And the people shall take them

3 And it shall come to pass in that
day that the Lord shall give thee
“rest, from thy sorrow, and from thy
fear, and from the hard bondage
wherein thou wast made to serve.

4 And it shall come to pass in
that day, that thou shalt take up
this proverb “against the king of
*’Babylon, and say: How hath the
oppressor ceased, the golden city
ceased!

5 The Lord hath broken the staff
of the *wicked, the scepters of the
rulers.

6 “He who smote the people in
wrath with a continual stroke, he
that ruled the nations in anger, is
persecuted, and none hindereth.

exalt my throne above the stars of

of the congregation, in the sides of
the north;

14 “I will ascend above the heights
of the clouds; I will be like the
Most High.

15 Yet thou shalt be brought down
to hell, to the sides of the “pit.

16 They that see thee shall nar-
rowly look upon thee, and shall
consider thee, and shall say: Is this
the man that made the earth to
tremble, that did shake kingdoms?

17 And made the world as a wil-
derness, and destroyed the cities
thereof, and opened not the house
of his prisoners?

18 All the kings of the nations, yea,
all of them, lie in glory, every one
of them in his own house.

19 But thou art cast out of thy
grave like an abominable branch,
and the remnant of those that are
slain, thrust through with a sword,
that go down to the stones of the
pit; as a carcass trodden under feet.

20 Thou shalt not be joined with
them in burial, because thou hast
destroyed thy land and slain thy
people; the “seed of ’evil-doers
shall never be renowned.

21 Prepare slaughter for his chil-
dren for the *iniquities of their
fathers, that they do not rise, nor
possess the land, nor fill the face
of the world with cities.

22 For I will rise up against them,
saith the Lord of Hosts, and cut off
from Babylon the “name, and rem-
nant, and son, and "nephew, saith
the Lord.

23 Iwill also make it a “possession
for the bittern, and pools of water;
and I will sweep it with the besom of
destruction, saith the Lord of Hosts.

24 The Lord of Hosts hath sworn,
saying: Surely as I have thought, so

 

96

shall it come to pass; and as I have
purposed, so shall it stand—

25 That I will bring the Assyrian in
my land, and upon my mountains
tread him under foot; then shall his
*yoke depart from off them, and
his burden depart from off their
shoulders.

26 This is the purpose that is pur-
posed upon the whole earth; and
this is the hand that is stretched
out upon all nations.

27 For the Lord of Hosts hath pur-
posed, and who shall disannul? And
his hand is stretched out, and who
shall turn it back?

28 In the year that king “Ahaz died
was this burden.

29 Rejoice not thou, whole Pales-
tina, because the rod of him that
“smote thee is broken; for out of
the serpent’s root shall come forth
a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be
a ‘fiery flying serpent.

30 And the firstborn of the poor
shall feed, and the needy shall lie
down in safety; and I will kill thy
root with famine, and he shall slay
thy remnant.

31 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou,
whole Palestina, art dissolved; for
there shall come from the north a
smoke, and none shall be alone in
his appointed times.

32 What shall then answer the
messengers of the nations? That
the Lord hath founded “Zion, and
the "poor of his people shall trust
in it.

Messiah—He will first come six hundred
years after Lehi left Jerusalem—The
Nephites keep the law of Moses and
believe in Christ, who is the Holy One
of Israel. About 559-545 B.c.

Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat
concerning the words which I have
written, which have been spoken
by the mouth of Isaiah. For behold,
Isaiah spake many things which
were “hard for many of my people
to understand; for they know not
concerning the manner of prophe-
sying among the Jews.

2 For I, Nephi, have not taught
them many things concerning the
manner of the Jews; for their “works
were works of darkness, and their
doings were doings of abominations.

3 Wherefore, I write unto my peo-
ple, unto all those that shall receive
hereafter these things which I write,
“that they may know the judgments
of God, that they come upon all na-
tions, according to the word which
he hath spoken.

4 Wherefore, hearken, O my peo-
ple, which are of the house of Is-
rael, and give ear unto my words;
for because the words of Isaiah are
not plain unto you, nevertheless
they are plain unto all those that
are filled with the “spirit of "proph-
ecy. But I give unto you a ‘prophecy,
according to the spirit which is in
me; wherefore I shall prophesy ac-
cording to the ¢plainness which hath
been with me from the time that I
came out from Jerusalem with my
father; for behold, my soul delight-
eth in ‘plainness unto my people,
that they may learn.

5 Yea, and my soul delighteth in

 

2 NEPHI 25:1-9

the words of “Isaiah, for I came out
from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath
beheld the things of the "Jews, and
I know that the Jews do ‘understand
the things of the prophets, and there
is none other people that under-
stand the things which were spoken
unto the Jews like unto them, save
it be that they are taught after the
manner of the things of the Jews.

6 But behold, I, Nephi, have not
taught my children after the man-
ner of the Jews; but behold, I, of
myself, have dwelt at Jerusalem,
wherefore I know concerning the
regions round about; and I have
made mention unto my children
concerning the judgments of God,
which “hath come to pass among the
Jews, unto my children, according
to all that which Isaiah hath spo-
ken, and I do not write them.

7 But behold, I proceed with mine
own prophecy, according to my
“plainness; in the which I "know
that no man can err; nevertheless,
in the days that the prophecies of
Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall
know of asurety, at the times when
they shall come to pass.

8 Wherefore, they are of “worth
unto the children of men, and he
that supposeth that they are not,
unto them will I speak particularly,
and confine the words unto mine
b’own people; for I know that they
shall be of great worth unto them in
the ‘last days; for in that day shall
they understand them; wherefore,
for their good have I written them.

9 And as one generation hath
been “destroyed among the Jews be-
cause of iniquity, even so have they
been destroyed from generation to

generation according to their in-
iquities; and never hath any of
them been destroyed save it were
*foretold them by the prophets of
the Lord.

10 Wherefore, it hath been told
them concerning the destruction
which should come upon them, im-
mediately after my father left ¢Jeru-
salem; nevertheless, they "hardened
their hearts; and according to my
prophecy they have been destroyed,
save it be those which are ‘carried
away “captive into Babylon.

11 And now this I speak because
of the “spirit which is in me. And
notwithstanding they have been
carried away they shall return
again, and possess the land of Je-
rusalem; wherefore, they shall be
’restored again to the ‘land of their
inheritance.

12 But, behold, they shall have
*wars, and rumors of wars; and when
the day cometh that the "Only Be-
gotten of the Father, yea, even the
Father of heaven and of earth, shall
‘manifest himself unto them in the
flesh, behold, they will reject him,
because of their iniquities, and the
hardness of their hearts, and the
stiffness of their necks.

13 Behold, they will ¢crucify him;
and after he is laid in a *sepulchre
for the space of ‘three days he shall
“rise from the dead, with healing in
his wings; and all those who shall
believe on his name shall be saved

 

98

in the kingdom of God. Wherefore,
my soul delighteth to prophesy con-
cerning him, for I have “seen his
day, and my heart doth magnify
his holy name.

14 And behold it shall come to
pass that after the “Messiah hath
risen from the dead, and hath
manifested himself unto his peo-
ple, unto as many as will believe on
his name, behold, Jerusalem shall
be 'destroyed again; for “wo unto
them that fight against God and
the people of his @church.

15 Wherefore, the “Jews shall be
’scattered among all nations; yea,
and also ‘Babylon shall be de-
stroyed; wherefore, the Jews shall be
scattered by other nations.

16 And after they have been
4scattered, and the Lord God hath
scourged them by other nations
for the space of many generations,
yea, even down from generation to
generation until they shall be per-
suaded to "believe in Christ, the Son
of God, and the atonement, which
is infinite for all mankind—and
when that day shall come that they
shall believe in Christ, and worship
the Father in his name, with pure
hearts and ‘clean hands, and look
not forward any more for “another
Messiah, then, at that time, the day
will come that it must needs be ex-
pedient that they should believe
these things.

17 And the Lord will set his hand

again the second time to “restore his
people from their lost and fallen
state. Wherefore, he will proceed to
doa ’marvelous work and a wonder
among the children of men.

18 Wherefore, he shall bring forth
“his ’words unto them, which words
shall ‘judge them at the last day,
for they shall be given them for
the purpose of “convincing them of
the true Messiah, who was rejected
by them; and unto the convincing
of them that they need not look
forward any more for a Messiah
to come, for there should not any
come, save it should be a “false
Messiah which should deceive
the people; for there is save one
Messiah spoken of by the prophets,
and that Messiah is he who should
be rejected of the Jews.

19 For according to the words of
the prophets, the “Messiah cometh
in *six hundred years from the
time that my father left Jerusalem;
and according to the words of the
prophets, and also the word of the
‘angel of God, his ‘name shall be
Jesus Christ, the ‘Son of God.

20 And now, my brethren, I have
spoken plainly that ye cannot err.
And as the Lord God liveth that
“brought Israel up out of the land of
Egypt, and gave unto Moses power
that he should "heal the nations

 

2 NEPHI 25:18-23

after they had been bitten by the
poisonous serpents, if they would
cast their eyes unto the ‘serpent
which he did raise up before them,
and also gave him power that he
should smite the ¢rock and the wa-
ter should come forth; yea, behold
Isay unto you, that as these things
are ‘true, and as the Lord God liv-
eth, there is none other ‘name given
under heaven save it be this Jesus
Christ, of which I have spoken,
whereby man can be saved.

21 Wherefore, for this cause hath
the Lord God promised unto me
that these things which I “write
shall be kept and preserved, and
handed down unto my seed, from
generation to generation, that the
promise may be fulfilled unto Jo-
seph, that his seed should never
’nerish as long as the earth should
stand.

22 Wherefore, these things shall
go from generation to generation
as long as the earth shall stand; and
they shall go according to the will
and pleasure of God; and the na-
tions who shall possess them shall
be “judged of them according to the
words which are written.

23 For we labor diligently to write,
to “persuade our children, and also
our brethren, to believe in Christ,
and to be reconciled to God; for we

know that it is by grace that we are
saved, after all we can ‘do,

24 And, notwithstanding we be-
lieve in Christ, we “keep the law
of Moses, and look forward with
steadfastness unto Christ, until the
law shall be fulfilled.

25 For, for this end was the “law
given; wherefore the law hath be-
come ’dead unto us, and we are
made alive in Christ because of our
faith; yet we keep the law because
of the commandments.

26 And we “talk of Christ, we re-
joice in Christ, we preach of Christ,
we "prophesy of Christ, and we write
according to our prophecies, that
our ‘children may know to what
source they may look for a “remis-
sion of their sins.

27 Wherefore, we speak concern-
ing the law that our children may
know the deadness of the law; and
they, by knowing the deadness of
the law, may look forward unto that
life which is in Christ, and know for
what end the law was given. And
after the law is fulfilled in Christ,
that they need not harden their
hearts against him when the law
ought to be done away.

28 And now behold, my people, ye
are a “stiffnecked people; wherefore,
Ihave spoken plainly unto you, that
ye cannot misunderstand. And the
words which I have spoken shall
stand as a *testimony against you;
for they are sufficient to ‘teach any
man the “right way; for the right
way is to believe in Christ and deny
him not; for by denying him ye also
deny the prophets and the law.

 

100

29 And now behold, I say unto you
that the right way is to believe in
Christ, and deny him not; and Christ
is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore
ye must bow down before him, and
“worship him with all your ’might,
mind, and strength, and your whole
soul; and if ye do this ye shall in
nowise be cast out.

30 And, inasmuch as it shall be
expedient, ye must keep the “per-
formances and ’ordinances of God
until the law shall be fulfilled which
was given unto Moses.

Christ will minister to the Nephites—

have beheld that many generations
shall pass away, and there shall be
great wars and contentions among
my people.

3 And after the Messiah shall come
there shall be “signs given unto my
people of his "birth, and also of his

out the “prophets, and the saints,
and stone them, and slay them;
wherefore the cry of the “blood of
the saints shall ascend up to God
from the ground against them.

4 Wherefore, all those who are
proud, and that do wickedly, the
day that cometh shall “burn them
up, saith the Lord of Hosts, for they
shall be as stubble.

5 And they that kill the “prophets,
and the saints, the depths of the
earth shall swallow them up, saith
the Lord of Hosts; and “mountains
shall cover them, and whirlwinds
shall carry them away, and build-
ings shall fall upon them and crush
them to pieces and grind them to
powder.

6 And they shall be visited with
thunderings, and lightnings, and
earthquakes, and all manner of de-
structions, for the “fire of the anger
of the Lord shall be kindled against
them, and they shall be as stubble,
and the day that cometh shall con-
sume them, saith the Lord of Hosts.

77*O the pain, and the anguish
of my soul for the loss of the slain of
my people! For I, Nephi, have seen
it, and it well nigh consumeth me
before the presence of the Lord;
but I must cry unto my God: Thy
ways are "just.

8 But behold, the righteous that
hearken unto the words of the proph-
ets, and destroy them not, but look
forward unto Christ with “stead fast-

 

2 NEPHI 26:4-13

ness for the signs which are given,
notwithstanding all "persecution—
behold, they are they which shall
‘not perish.

9 But the Son of Righteousness
shall “appear unto them; and he
shall *heal them, and they shall have
“peace with him, until “three genera-
tions shall have passed away, and
many of the ‘fourth generation shall
have passed away in righteousness.

10 And when these things have
passed away a speedy “destruc-
tion cometh unto my people; for,
notwithstanding the pains of my
soul, I have seen it; wherefore, I
know that it shall come to pass; and
they sell themselves for naught; for,
for the reward of their pride and
their *foolishness they shall reap
destruction; for because they yield
unto the devil and ‘choose works of
4darkness rather than light, there-
fore they must go down to ‘hell.

11 For the Spirit of the Lord will
not always “strive with man. And
when the Spirit *ceaseth to strive
with man then cometh speedy de-
struction, and this grieveth my
soul.

12 And as I spake concerning the
“convincing of the Jews, that Jesus
is the ‘very Christ, it must needs
be that the Gentiles be convinced
also that Jesus is the Christ, the
“Eternal °God;

13 And that he “manifesteth him-
self unto all those who believe in

him, by the power of the "Holy
Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kin-
dred, tongue, and people, working
mighty ‘miracles, signs, and won-
ders, among the children of men
according to their “faith.

14 But behold, I prophesy unto
you concerning the “last days; con-
cerning the days when the Lord
God shall *bring these things forth
unto the children of men.

15 After my seed and the seed of
my brethren shall have “dwindled
in unbelief, and shall have been
smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after
the Lord God shall have *camped
against them round about, and shall
have laid siege against them with
a mount, and raised forts against
them; and after they shall have been
brought down low in the dust, even
that they are not, yet the words of
the righteous shall be written, and
the ‘prayers of the faithful shall
be heard, and all those who have
4dwindled in unbelief shall not be
forgotten.

16 For those who shall be destroyed
shall “speak unto them out of the
ground, and their speech shall be
low out of the dust, and their voice
shall be as one that hath a famil-
iar spirit; for the Lord God will
give unto him power, that he may
whisper concerning them, even as
it were out of the ground; and their
speech shall whisper out of the dust.

 

102

17 For thus saith the Lord God:
They shall write the things which
shall be done among them, and
they shall be written and ’sealed
up in a book, and those who have
dwindled in ‘unbelief shall not
have them, for they “seek to destroy
the things of God.

18 Wherefore, as those who have
been destroyed have been destroyed
speedily; and the multitude of their
“terrible ones shall be as ’chaff that
passeth away—yea, thus saith the
Lord God: It shall be at an instant,
suddenly—

19 And it shall come to pass, that
those who have dwindled in unbe-
lief shall be “smitten by the hand
of the Gentiles.

20 And the Gentiles are lifted up
in the “pride of their eyes, and have
’stumbled, because of the greatness
of their ‘stumbling block, that they
have built up many “churches; nev-
ertheless, they ‘put down the power
and miracles of God, and preach up
unto themselves their own wisdom
and their own ‘learning, that they
may get gain and “grind upon the
face of the poor.

21 And there are many churches
built up which cause “envyings,
and °strifes, and “malice.

22 And there are also secret *com-
binations, even as in times of old,
according to the combinations of
the devil, for he is the founder of

all these things; yea, the founder
of murder, and ‘works of darkness;
yea, and he leadeth them by the
neck with a flaxen cord, until he
bindeth them with his strong cords
forever.

23 For behold, my beloved breth-
ren, I say unto you that the Lord
God worketh not in “darkness.

24 He doeth not “anything save it
be for the benefit of the world; for
he *loveth the world, even that he
layeth down his own life that he may
draw ‘all men unto him. Wherefore,
he commandeth none that they
shall not partake of his salvation.

25 Behold, doth he cry unto any,
saying: Depart from me? Behold,
I say unto you, Nay; but he saith:
“Come unto me all ye "ends of the
earth, ‘buy milk and honey, without
money and without price.

26 Behold, hath he commanded
any that they should ¢depart out of
the synagogues, or out of the houses
of worship? Behold, I say unto you,
Nay.

27 Hath he commanded any that
they should not partake of his ¢sal-
vation? Behold I say unto you, Nay;
but he hath given it free for all
men; and he hath commanded his
people that they should persuade
all men to ‘repentance.

28 Behold, hath the Lord com-
manded any that they should not
partake of his goodness? Behold I
say unto you, Nay; but “all men are
privileged the one *like unto the
other, and none are forbidden.

 

2 NEPHI 26:23-33

29 He commandeth that there
shall be no “priestcrafts; for, behold,
priestcrafts are that men preach
and set themselves up for a light
unto the world, that they may get
‘gain and “praise of the world; but
they seek not the ‘welfare of Zion.

30 Behold, the Lord hath forbid-
den this thing; wherefore, the Lord
God hath given a commandment
that all men should have “charity,
which °charity is “love. And except
they should have charity they were
nothing. Wherefore, if they should
have charity they would not suffer
the laborer in Zion to perish.

31 But the “laborer in °Zion shall
labor for Zion; for if they labor for
‘money they shall perish.

32 And again, the Lord God hath
“commanded that men should not
murder; that they should not lie;
that they should not ’steal; that they
should not take the name of the Lord
their God in ‘vain; that they should
not “envy; that they should not have
‘malice; that they should not con-
tend one with another; that they
should not commit ‘whoredoms;
and that they should do none of
these things; for whoso doeth them
shall perish.

33 For none of these iniquities
come of the Lord; for he doeth that
which is good among the children of
men; and he doeth nothing save it
be plain unto the children of men;
and he “inviteth them °all to “come
unto him and partake of his good-
ness; and he ¢denieth none that come

CHAPTER 27

Darkness and apostasy will cover the
earth in the last days—The Book of Mor-
mon will come forth—Three witnesses
will testify of the book—The learned man
will say he cannot read the sealed book—
The Lord will do a marvelous work
and a wonder—Compare Isaiah 29.
About 559-545 B.C.

BUT, behold, in the “last days, or in
the days of the Gentiles—yea, be-
hold all the nations of the Gentiles
and also the Jews, both those who
shall come upon this land and those
who shall be upon other lands, yea,
even upon all the lands of the earth,
behold, they will be "drunken with
iniquity and all manner of abomi-
nations—

2 And when that day shall come
they shall be “visited of the Lord of
Hosts, with thunder and with earth-
quake, and with a great noise, and
with storm, and with tempest, and
with the *flame of devouring fire.

3 And all the “nations that *fight
against Zion, and that distress her,
shall be as a dream of a night vision;
yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto
a hungry man which dreameth, and
behold he eateth but he awaketh
and his soul is empty; or like unto
a thirsty man which dreameth, and
behold he drinketh but he awaketh
and behold he is faint, and his soul

 

104

hath appetite; yea, even so shall the
multitude of all the nations be that
fight against Mount Zion.

4 For behold, all ye that doeth in-
iquity, stay yourselves and wonder,
for ye shall cry out, and cry; yea, ye
shall be “drunken but not with wine,
ye shall stagger but not with strong
drink.

5 For behold, the Lord hath poured
out upon you the spirit of deep
sleep. For behold, ye have closed
your “eyes, and ye have "rejected the
prophets; and your rulers, and the
seers hath he covered because of
your iniquity.

6 And it shall come to pass that
the Lord God shall bring forth unto
“you the words of a book, and they
shall be the words of them which
have slumbered.

7 And behold the book shall be
*sealed; and in the book shall be a
’revelation from God, from the be-
ginning of the world to the ‘ending
thereof.

8 Wherefore, because of the things
which are ‘sealed up, the things
which are sealed shall not be deliv-
ered in the day of the wickedness
and abominations of the people.
Wherefore the book shall be kept
from them,

9 But the book shall be delivered
unto a man, and he shall deliver
the words of the book, which are the
words of those who have slumbered
in the dust, and he shall deliver
these words unto “another;

10 But the words which are ‘sealed
he shall not deliver, neither shall he
deliver the book, For the book shall

be sealed by the power of God, and
the revelation which was sealed
shall be kept in the book until the
own due time of the Lord, that they
may come forth; for behold, they ’re-
veal all things from the foundation
of the world unto the end thereof.

11 And the day cometh that the
words of the book which were sealed
shall be read upon the house tops;
and they shall be read by the power
of Christ; and all things shall be
“revealed unto the children of men
which ever have been among the
children of men, and which ever will
be even unto the end of the earth.

12 Wherefore, at that day when
the book shall be delivered unto the
man of whom I have spoken, the
book shall be hid from the eyes of
the world, that the eyes of none shall
behold it save it be that “three °wit-
nesses shall behold it, by the power
of God, besides him to whom the
book shall be delivered; and they
shall testify to the truth of the book
and the things therein.

13 And there is “none other which
shall view it, save it be a few accord-
ing to the will of God, to bear testi-
mony of his word unto the children
of men; for the Lord God hath said
that the words of the faithful should
speak as if it were "from the dead.

14 Wherefore, the Lord God will
proceed to bring forth the words
of the book; and in the mouth of
as many witnesses as seemeth him
good will he establish his word; and
wo be unto him that “rejecteth the
word of God!

15 But behold, it shall come to
pass that the Lord God shall say
unto him to whom he shall deliver

 

2 NEPHI 27:11-23

the book: Take these words which
are not sealed and deliver them to
another, that he may show them
unto the learned, saying: “Read this,
I pray thee. And the learned shall
say: Bring hither the book, and I
will read them.

16 And now, because of the glory
of the world and to get “gain will
they say this, and not for the glory
of God.

17 And the man shall say: I can-
not bring the book, for it is sealed.

18 Then shall the learned say: I
cannot read it.

19 Wherefore it shall come to pass,
that the Lord God will “deliver again
the book and the words thereof to
him that is not learned; and the
man that is not learned shall say:
Iam not learned.

20 Then shall the Lord God say
unto him: The learned shall not read
them, for they have rejected them,
and Lam Zable to do mine own work;
wherefore thou shalt read the words
which I shall give unto thee.

21 “Touch not the things which are
sealed, for I will bring them forth in
mine own due time; for I will show
unto the children of men that Iam
able to do mine own work.

22 Wherefore, when thou hast read
the words which I have commanded
thee, and obtained the “witnesses
which I have promised unto thee,
then shalt thou seal up the book
again, and hide it up unto me, that
I may preserve the words which
thou hast not read, until I shall see
fit in mine own “wisdom to ‘reveal
all things unto the children of men.

23 For behold, Iam God; and lam
a God of “miracles; and I will show

unto the "world that lam the same
yesterday, today, and forever; and I
‘work not among the children of men
save it be “according to their faith.

24 And again it shall come to pass
that the Lord shall say unto him
that shall read the words that shall
be delivered him:

25 *Forasmuch as this people draw
near unto me with their mouth,
and with their lips do "honor me,
but have removed their “hearts far
from me, and their fear towards me
is taught by the “precepts of men—

26 Therefore, I will proceed to do
a ¢marvelous work among this
people, yea, a "marvelous work and
a wonder, for the “wisdom of their
wise and “learned shall perish,
and the ‘understanding of their
fprudent shall be hid.

27 And “wo unto them that seek
deep to hide their "counsel from the
Lord! And their works are in the
‘dark; and they say: Who seeth us,
and who knoweth us? And they also
say: Surely, your turning of things
upside down shall be esteemed as
the “potter’s clay. But behold, I will
show unto them, saith the Lord of
Hosts, that I ‘know all their works.
For shall the work say of him that
made it, he made me not? Or shall
the thing framed say of him that
framed it, he had no understanding?

28 But behold, saith the Lord of
Hosts: I will show unto the children
of men that it is yet a very little
while and Lebanon shall be turned
into a fruitful field; and the “fruitful
field shall be esteemed as a forest.

29 “And in that day shall the "deaf

 

106

hear the words of the book, and
the eyes of the blind shall see out
of obscurity and out of darkness.

30 And the “meek also shall in-
crease, and their joy shall be in the
Lord, and the poor among men shall
rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

31 For assuredly as the Lord liv-
eth they shall see that the “terrible
one is brought to naught, and the
scorner is consumed, and all that
watch for iniquity are cut off;

32 And they that make a man an
“offender for a word, and lay a snare
for him that reproveth in the ’gate,
and ‘turn aside the just for a thing
of naught.

33 Therefore, thus saith the Lord,
who redeemed Abraham, concern-
ing the house of Jacob: Jacob shall
“not now be ashamed, neither shall
his face now wax pale.

34 But when he “seeth his children,
the work of my hands, in the midst
of him, they shall sanctify my name,
and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,
and shall fear the God of Israel.

35 They also that “erred in spirit
shall come to understanding, and they
that murmured shall "learn doctrine.

as the Spirit hath constrained me;
wherefore, I know that they must
surely come to pass.

2 And the things which shall be
written out of the “book shall be of
great ’worth unto the children of
men, and especially unto our seed,
which is a ‘remnant of the house
of Israel.

3 For it shall come to pass in that
day that the “churches which are built
up, and not unto the Lord, when the
one shall say unto the other: Behold,
I, lam the Lord’s; and the others shall
say: I, 1am the Lord’s; and thus shall
every one say that hath built up
’churches, and not unto the Lord—

4 And they shall contend one with
another; and their priests shall con-
tend one with another, and they
shall teach with their “learning,
and deny the "Holy Ghost, which
giveth utterance.

5 And they ¢deny the "power of
God, the Holy One of Israel; and
they say unto the people: Hearken
unto us, and hear ye our precept;
for behold there is “no God today,
for the Lord and the Redeemer hath
done his work, and he hath given
his power unto men;

6 Behold, hearken ye unto my
precept; if they shall say there isa
miracle wrought by the hand of the
Lord, believe it not; for this day he
is not a God of “miracles; he hath
done his work.

7 Yea, and there shall be many
which shall say: “Eat, drink, and be
merry, for tomorrow we die; and it
shall be well with us.

8 And there shall also be many
which shall say: “Eat, drink, and be
>’merry; nevertheless, fear God—he
will ‘justify in committing a little
4sin; yea, ‘lie a little, take the advan-
tage of one because of his words,
dig a ‘pit for thy neighbor; there is
no harm in this; and do all these
things, for tomorrow we die; and if
it so be that we are guilty, God will
beat us with a few stripes, and at
last we shall be saved in the king-
dom of God.

9 Yea, and there shall be many
which shall teach after this manner,
“false and vain and “foolish ‘doc-
trines, and shall be puffed up in
their hearts, and shall seek deep to
hide their counsels from the Lord;
and their works shall be in the dark.

10 And the “blood of the saints shall
cry from the ground against them.

11 Yea, they have all gone out of the
“way; they have become ’corrupted.

12 Because of “pride, and because
of *false teachers, and ‘false doc-
trine, their churches have become
corrupted, and their churches are
lifted up; because of pride they are
puffed up.

their fine sanctuaries; they rob the
poor because of their fine clothing;

and they persecute the meek and
the poor in heart, because in their
‘pride they are puffed up.

14 They wear “stiff necks and high
heads; yea, and because of pride,
and wickedness, and abominations,
and ’whoredoms, they have all
“gone astray save it be a “few, who
are the humble followers of Christ;
nevertheless, they are “led, that in
many instances they do/err because
they are taught by the precepts
of men.

15 O the “wise, and the learned,
and the rich, that are puffed up in
the "pride of their ‘hearts, and all
those who preach “false doctrines,
and all those who commit ‘whore-
doms, and pervert the right way of
the Lord, ‘wo, wo, wo be unto them,
saith the Lord God Almighty, for
they shall be thrust down to hell!

16 Wo unto them that “turn aside
the just for a thing of naught and
brevile against that which is good,
and say that it is of no worth! For
the day shall come that the Lord
God will speedily visit the inhabi-
tants of the earth; and in that day
that they are ‘fully ripe in iniquity
they shall perish.

17 But behold, if the inhabitants
of the earth shall repent of their
wickedness and abominations they
shall not be destroyed, saith the
Lord of Hosts.

18 But behold, that great and
Zabominable church, the "whore
of all the earth, must ‘tumble to

 

108

the earth, and great must be the
fall thereof.

19 For the kingdom of the devil
must “shake, and they which belong
to it must needs be stirred up unto
repentance, or the devil will grasp
them with his everlasting ‘chains,
and they be stirred up to anger,
and perish;

20 For behold, at that day shall he
“rage in the hearts of the children
of men, and stir them up to anger
against that which is good.

21 And others will he “pacify, and
lull them away into carnal ’secu-
rity, that they will say: All is well
in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is
well—and thus the ‘devil ¢cheateth
their souls, and leadeth them away
carefully down to hell.

22 And behold, others he “flattereth
away, and telleth them there is no
bhell; and he saith unto them: I am
no devil, for there is none—and thus
he whispereth in their ears, until he
grasps them with his awful ‘chains,
from whence there is no deliverance.

23 Yea, they are grasped with
death, and hell; and death, and
hell, and the devil, and all that
have been seized therewith must
stand before the throne of God,
and be “judged according to their
works, from whence they must go
into the place prepared for them,

which is endless torment.

25 Wo be unto him that crieth:
All is well!

26 Yea, wo be unto him that “heark-
eneth unto the precepts of men, and
denieth the power of God, and the
gift of the Holy Ghost!

27 Yea, wo be unto him that saith:
We have received, and we “need
no more!

28 And in fine, wo unto all those
who tremble, and are “angry because
of the truth of God! For behold, he
that is built upon the ‘rock @receiv-
eth it with gladness; and he that
is built upon a sandy foundation
trembleth lest he shall fall.

29 Wo be unto him that shall say:
We have received the word of God,
and we “need ’no more of the word
of God, for we have enough!

30 For behold, thus saith the Lord
God: I will give unto the children of
men line upon line, “precept upon
precept, here a little and there a
little; and blessed are those who
hearken unto my precepts, and lend
an ear unto my counsel, for they
shall learn "wisdom; for unto him
that ‘receiveth I will give “more; and
from them that shall say, We have
enough, from them shall be taken
away even that which they have.

31 Cursed is he that putteth his
“trust in man, or maketh flesh his
arm, or shall hearken unto the "pre-
cepts of men, save their precepts
shall be given by the power of the
Holy Ghost.

32 “Wo be unto the Gentiles, saith
the Lord God of Hosts! For notwith-

 

2 NEPHI 28:25-29:3

standing I shall lengthen out mine
arm unto them from day to day,
they will deny me; nevertheless, I
will be merciful unto them, saith
the Lord God, if they will repent
and ’come unto me; for mine ‘arm
is lengthened out all the day long,
saith the Lord God of Hosts.

CHAPTER 29

Many Gentiles will reject the Book of
Mormon—They will say, We need no
more Bible—The Lord speaks to many
nations—He will judge the world out of
the books which will be written. About
559-545 B.C.

But behold, there shall be many—
at that day when I shall proceed to
do a4marvelous work among them,
that Imay remember my "covenants
which I have made unto the chil-
dren of men, that I may set my hand
again the ‘second time to recover
my people, which are of the house
of Israel;

2 And also, that I may remember
the promises which I have made
unto thee, Nephi, and also unto
thy father, that I would remember
your seed; and that the *words
of your seed should proceed forth
out of my mouth unto your seed;
and my words shall "hiss forth
unto the ‘ends of the earth, for a
4standard unto my people, which
are of the house of Israel;

3 And because my words shall hiss
forth—many of the Gentiles shall
say: A “Bible! A Bible! We have

got a Bible, and there cannot be
any more Bible.

4 But thus saith the Lord God: O
fools, they shall have a “Bible; and
it shall proceed forth from the "Jews,
mine ancient covenant people. And
what ‘thank they the “Jews for the
Bible which they receive from them?
Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do
they remember the travails, and the
labors, and the pains of the Jews, and
their diligence unto me, in bringing
forth salvation unto the Gentiles?

5 Oye Gentiles, have ye remembered
the Jews, mine ancient covenant
people? Nay; but ye have “cursed
them, and have *hated them, and
have not sought to recover them. But
behold, I will return all these things
upon your own heads; for Ithe Lord
have not forgotten my people.

6 Thou fool, that shall say: A “Bible,
we have got a Bible, and we need
no more Bible. Have ye obtained
a Bible save it were by the Jews?

7 Know ye not that there are more
“nations than one? Know ye not
that I, the Lord your God, have cre-
ated all men, and that I remember
those who are upon the “isles of the
sea; and that I rule in the heavens
above and in the ‘earth beneath;
and I bring forth my ¢word unto the
children of men, yea, even upon all
the nations of the earth?

8 Wherefore murmur ye, because
that ye shall receive more of my
word? Know ye not that the “testi-

 

110

mony of two nations is a ‘witness
unto you that I am God, that I re-
member one “nation like unto an-
other? Wherefore, I speak the same
words unto one nation like unto
another, And when the two ‘nations
shall run together the testimony of
the two nations shall run together
also.

9 And I do this that I may prove
unto many that Iam the “same yes-
terday, today, and forever; and that
I speak forth my ’words according
to mine own pleasure. And be-
cause that I have spoken one ‘word
ye need not suppose that I cannot
speak another; for my ¢work is not
yet finished; neither shall it be until
the end of man, neither from that
time henceforth and forever.

10 Wherefore, because that ye have
a Bible ye need not suppose that
it contains all my “words; neither
’need ye suppose that I have not
caused more to be written.

11 For I command 4all men, both
in the east and in the west, and in
the north, and in the south, and
in the islands of the sea, that they
shall write the words which I speak
unto them; for out of the “books
which shall be written I will ¢judge
the world, every man according to
their works, according to that which
is written.

12 For behold, I shall speak unto
the “Jews and they shall °write
it; and I shall also speak unto the

Nephites and they shall ‘write it;
and I shall also speak unto the
other tribes of the house of Israel,
which I have led away, and they
shall write it; and I shall also speak
unto “all nations of the earth and
they shall write it.

13 And it shall come to pass that
the “Jews shall have the words of
the Nephites, and the Nephites shall
have the words of the Jews; and the
Nephites and the Jews shall have
the words of the “lost tribes of Is-
rael; and the lost tribes of Israel
shall have the words of the Neph-
ites and the Jews.

14 And it shall come to pass that my
people, which are of the “house of
Israel, shall be gathered home unto
the “lands of their possessions; and
my word also shall be gathered in
‘one. And I will show unto them that
fight against my word and against
my “people, who are of the “house
of Israel, that I am God, and that I
fecovenanted with ‘Abraham that
I would remember his “seed ‘forever.

CHAPTER 30

Converted Gentiles will be numbered
with the covenant people—Many La-
manites and Jews will believe the word
and become delightsome—Israel will
be restored and the wicked destroyed.
About 559-545 B.C.

AND now behold, my beloved breth-
ren, | would speak unto you; for
I, Nephi, would not suffer that ye

 

2 NEPHI 29:13-30:5

should suppose that ye are more
righteous than the Gentiles shall
be. For behold, except ye shall keep
the commandments of God ye shall
all likewise “perish; and because of
the words which have been spoken
ye need not suppose that the Gen-
tiles are utterly destroyed.

2 For behold, I say unto you that
as many of the Gentiles as will re-
pent are the “covenant people of
the Lord; and as many of the "Jews
as will not repent shall be ‘cast off;
for the Lord “covenanteth with none
save it be with them that ‘repent
and believe in his Son, who is the
Holy One of Israel.

3 And now, I would prophesy some-
what more concerning the Jews and
the Gentiles. For after the book of
which I have spoken shall come
forth, and be written unto the Gen-
tiles, and sealed up again unto the
Lord, there shall be many which
shall “believe the words which are
written; and 'they shall carry them
forth unto the ‘remnant of our seed.

4 And then shall the remnant of
our seed know concerning us, how
that we came out from Jerusalem,
and that they are descendants of
the Jews.

5 And the gospel of Jesus Christ
shall be declared among “them;
wherefore, *they shall be restored
unto the ‘knowledge of their fathers,
and also to the knowledge of Jesus
Christ, which was had among their
fathers.

6 And then shall they rejoice; for
they shall “know that it is a blessing
unto them from the hand of God;
and their scales of darkness shall
begin to fall from their eyes; and
many generations shall not pass
away among them, save they shall
bea pure and a “delightsome people.

7 And it shall come to pass that
the “Jews which are scattered also
shall "begin to believe in Christ; and
they shall begin to gather in upon
the face of the land; and as many
as shall believe in Christ shall also
become a delightsome people.

8 And it shall come to pass that
the Lord God shall commence his
work among all nations, kindreds,
tongues, and people, to bring about
the “restoration of his people upon
the earth.

9 And with righteousness shall the
“Lord God *judge the poor, and re-
prove with equity for the ‘meek of
the earth. And he shall smite the
earth with the rod of his mouth; and
with the breath of his lips shall he
slay the wicked.

10 For the “time speedily cometh
that the Lord God shall cause a
great 'division among the people,
and the wicked will he ‘destroy; and
he will “spare his people, yea, even
if itso be that he must “destroy the
wicked by fire.

11 And “righteousness shall be the
girdle of his loins, and faithfulness
the girdle of his reins.

12 *And then shall the wolf dwell
with the lamb; and the leopard
shall lie down with the kid, and

 

112

the calf, and the young lion, and
the fatling, together; and a little
child shall lead them.

13 And the cow and the bear shall
feed; their young ones shall lie
down together; and the lion shall
eat straw like the ox.

14 And the sucking child shall
play on the hole of the asp, and the
weaned child shall put his hand on
the cockatrice’s den.

15 They shall not hurt nor destroy
in all my holy *mountain; for the
earth shall be full of the "knowl-
edge of the Lord as the waters cover
the sea.

16 Wherefore, the things of “all
nations shall be made known; yea,
all things shall be made known
unto the children of men.

17 There is nothing which is secret
save it shall be “revealed; there is
no work of darkness save it shall be
made manifest in the light; and there
is nothing which is sealed upon
the earth save it shall be loosed.

18 Wherefore, all things which
have been revealed unto the chil-
dren of men shall at that ¢day be
revealed; and Satan shall have power
over the hearts of the children of
men ’no more, for a long time, And
now, my beloved brethren, I make
an end of my sayings.

baptism are the gate to the strait and
narrow path—Eternal life comes to
those who keep the commandments after
baptism. About 559-545 B.c.

AND now I, Nephi, make an end of
my “prophesying unto you, my be-
loved brethren. And I cannot write
but a few things, which 1 know must
surely come to pass; neither can I
write but a few of the ’words of my
brother Jacob.

2 Wherefore, the things which I
have written sufficeth me, save it
be a few words which I “must speak
concerning the doctrine of Christ;
wherefore, I shall speak unto you
plainly, according to the plainness
of my prophesying.

3 For my soul delighteth in “plain-
ness; for after this manner doth the
Lord God work among the children
of men. For the Lord God giveth
light unto the "understanding; for
he speaketh unto men according
to their ‘language, unto their un-
derstanding.

4 Wherefore, I would that ye
should remember that I have spoken
unto you concerning that “prophet
which the Lord showed unto me,
that should baptize the "Lamb of
God, which should take away the
sins of the world.

5 And now, if the Lamb of God, he
being “holy, should have need to
be baptized by water, to fulfil all
righteousness, O then, how much
more need have we, being unholy,
to be ‘baptized, yea, even by water!

6 And now, I would ask of you, my
beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb

2 NEPHI 31:1-13

of God did fulfil all righteousness
in being baptized by water?

7 Know ye not that he was holy?
But notwithstanding he being holy,
he showeth unto the children of
men that, according to the flesh he
humbleth himself before the Father,
and witnesseth unto the Father that
he would be “obedient unto him in
keeping his commandments.

8 Wherefore, after he was baptized
with water the Holy Ghost descended
upon him in the “form of a ’dove.

9 And again, it showeth unto the
children of men the straitness of the
path, and the narrowness of the gate,
by which they should enter, he hav-
ing set the "example before them.

10 And he said unto the children
of men: “Follow thou me. Where-
fore, my beloved brethren, can we
’follow Jesus save we shall be will-
ing to keep the commandments of
the Father?

11 And the Father said: Repent ye,
repent ye, and be baptized in the
name of my Beloved Son.

12 And also, the voice of the Son
came unto me, saying: He that is
baptized in my name, to him will
the Father “give the Holy Ghost,
like unto me; wherefore, °follow
me, and do the things which ye
have seen me do.

13 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, I Know that if ye shall *follow
the Son, with full purpose of heart,
acting no °hypocrisy and no de-
ception before God, but with real
‘intent, repenting of your sins, wit-
nessing unto the Father that ye are
4willing to take upon you the ‘name

of Christ, by ‘baptism—yea, by fol-
lowing your Lord and your Savior
down into the water, according to his
word, behold, then shall ye receive
the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh
the ‘baptism of fire and of the Holy
Ghost; and then can ye speak with
the "tongue of angels, and shout
praises unto the Holy One of Israel.

14 But, behold, my beloved breth-
ren, thus came the voice of the Son
unto me, saying: After ye have re-
pented of your sins, and witnessed
unto the Father that ye are willing
to keep my commandments, by the
baptism of water, and have received
the baptism of fire and of the Holy
Ghost, and can speak with a new
tongue, yea, even with the tongue of
angels, and after this should “deny
me, it would have been °better for
you that ye had not known me.

15 And I heard a voice from the
Father, saying: Yea, the “words of
my Beloved are true and faithful.
He that *endureth to the ‘end, the
same shall be saved.

16 And now, my beloved brethren,
I know by this that unless a man
shall “endure to the end, in follow-
ing the "example of the Son of the
living God, he cannot be saved.

17 Wherefore, do the things which
Ihave told you I have seen that your
Lord and your Redeemer should do;
for, for this cause have they been
shown unto me, that ye might know

 

114

the gate by which ye should enter.
For the gate by which ye should
enter is repentance and “baptism
by water; and then cometh a ’re-
mission of your sins by fire and by
the Holy Ghost.

18 And then are ye in this “strait
and narrow ’path which leads to
eternal life; yea, ye have entered in
by the gate; ye have done according
to the commandments of the Father
and the Son; and ye have received
the Holy Ghost, which ‘witnesses of
the “Father and the Son, unto the
fulfilling of the promise which he
hath made, that if ye entered in by
the way ye should receive.

19 And now, my beloved brethren,
after ye have gotten into this strait
and narrow “path, I would ask if all
is "done? Behold, I say unto you,
Nay; for ye have not come thus far
save it were by the word of Christ
with unshaken ‘faith in him, “rely-
ing wholly upon the merits of him
who is mighty to “save.

20 Wherefore, ye must press for-
ward with a “steadfastness in Christ,
having a perfect brightness of
*hope, and a ‘love of God and of all
men. Wherefore, if ye shall press
forward, feasting upon the word
of Christ, and “endure to the end,
behold, thus saith the Father: Ye
shall have “eternal life.

21 And now, behold, my beloved
brethren, this is the “way; and there

CHAPTER 32

Angels speak by the power of the Holy
Ghost—Men must pray and gain knowl-
edge for themselves from the Holy Ghost.
About 559-545 B.C.

AND now, behold, my beloved breth-
ren, I suppose that ye ponder some-
what in your hearts concerning that
which ye should do after ye have
entered in by the way. But, behold,
why do ye ponder these things in
your hearts?

2 Do ye not remember that I said
unto you that after ye had “received
the Holy Ghost ye could speak with
the tongue of angels? And now, how
could ye speak with the tongue of
angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?

3 “Angels speak by the power of
the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they
speak the words of Christ. Where-
fore, I said unto you, "feast upon
the ‘words of Christ; for behold, the
words of Christ will “tell you all
things what ye should do.

4 Wherefore, now after I have
spoken these words, if ye cannot
understand them it will be because
ye “ask not, neither do ye knock;
wherefore, ye are not brought into

2 NEPHI 32:1-9

the light, but must perish in the
dark.

5 For behold, again I say unto you
that if ye will enter in by the way,
and receive the Holy Ghost, it will
“show unto you all things what ye
should do.

6 Behold, this is the doctrine of
Christ, and there will be no more
doctrine given until after he shall
*manifest himself unto you in the
flesh. And when he shall manifest
himself unto you in the flesh, the
things which he shall say unto you
shall ye observe to do.

7 And now I, Nephi, cannot say
more; the Spirit stoppeth mine
utterance, and I am left to mourn
because of the “unbelief, and the
wickedness, and the ignorance, and
the ’stiffneckedness of men; for they
will ‘not search “knowledge, nor
understand great knowledge, when
it is given unto them in “plainness,
even as plain as word can be.

8 And now, my beloved brethren, I
perceive that ye ponder still in your
hearts; and it grieveth me that I must
speak concerning this thing. For if
ye would hearken unto the “Spirit
which teacheth a man to "pray, ye
would know that ye must ‘pray; for
the “evil spirit teacheth not a man
to pray, but teacheth him that he
must not pray.

9 But behold, I say unto you that
ye must “pray always, and not faint;
that ye must not perform any thing
unto the Lord save in the first place
ye shall °pray unto the Father in

thee, that thy performance may be
for the °welfare of thy soul.

CHAPTER 33

Nephi’s words are true—They testify
of Christ—Those who believe in Christ
will believe Nephi’s words, which will
stand as a witness before the judgment
bar. About 559-545 B.c.

AND now I, Nephi, cannot write all
the things which were taught among
my people; neither am I *mighty
in writing, like unto speaking;
for when a man ’speaketh by the
power of the Holy Ghost the power
of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto
the hearts of the children of men.

2 But behold, there are many
that “harden their "hearts against
the ‘Holy Spirit, that it hath no
place in them; wherefore, they cast
many things away which are writ-
ten and esteem them as things of
naught.

3 But I, Nephi, have written what
Ihave written, and I esteem it as of
great “worth, and especially unto
my people. For I *pray continually
for them by day, and mine ‘eyes
water my pillow by night, because
of them; and I cry unto my God in
faith, and I know that he will hear
my cry.

4 And I know that the Lord God
will consecrate my prayers for the

 

116

gain of my people. And the words
which I have written in weakness
will be made strong unto them; for
it *persuadeth them to do good; it
maketh known unto them of their
fathers; and it speaketh of Jesus,
and persuadeth them to believe
in him, and to endure to the end,
which is life "eternal.

5 And it speaketh “harshly against
sin, according to the ’plainness of
the truth; wherefore, no man will
be angry at the words which I have
written save he shall be of the spirit
of the devil.

6 1 glory in °plainness; I glory in
truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he
hath ‘redeemed my soul from hell.

71 have “charity for my people,
and great faith in Christ that I
shall meet many souls spotless at
his judgment-seat.

81 have charity for the “Jew—lI
say Jew, because I mean them from
whence I came.

9 Lalso have charity for the Gen-
tiles, But behold, for none of “these
can I hope except they shall be ’rec-
onciled unto Christ, and enter into
the ‘narrow “gate, and ‘walk in the
‘strait path which leads to life, and
continue in the path until the end
of the day of *probation.

10 And now, my beloved brethren,
and also “Jew, and all ye ends of the
earth, hearken unto these words and
>believe in Christ; and if ye believe
not in these words believe in Christ.

And if ye shall ‘believe in Christ ye
will believe in these “words, for they
are the ‘words of Christ, and he hath
given them unto me; and they ‘teach
all men that they should do good.

11 And if they are not the words
of Christ, judge ye—for Christ will
show unto you, with “power and
great glory, that they are his words,
at the last day; and you and I shall
stand face to face before his bar; and
ye shall know that I have been com-
manded of him to write these things,
notwithstanding my weakness.

12 And I pray the Father in the
name of Christ that many of us, if
not all, may be saved in his “king-
dom at that great and last day.

13 And now, my beloved brethren,

 

2 NEPHI 33:11-JACOB 1:3

all those who are of the house of
Israel, and all ye ends of the earth,
I speak unto you as the voice of one
“crying from the dust: Farewell un-
til that great day shall come.

14 And you that will not partake
of the goodness of God, and respect
the words of the “Jews, and also my
b>words, and the words which shall
proceed forth out of the mouth of
the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you
an everlasting farewell, for these
words shall ‘condemn you at the

be brought against you at the “judg-
ment bar; for thus hath the Lord
commanded me, and I must "obey.

THE BOOK OF JACOB

THE BROTHER OF NEPHI

The words of his preaching unto his brethren. He confoundeth a man who
seeketh to overthrow the doctrine of Christ. A few words concerning the his-

tory of the people of Nephi.

CHAPTER 1

Jacob and Joseph seek to persuade men
to believe in Christ and keep His com-
mandments—Nephi dies—Wickedness
prevails among the Nephites. About
544-421 B.C.

OR behold, it came to pass
that fifty and five years had

passed away from the time
that Lehi left Jerusalem; where-
fore, Nephi gave me, Jacob, a “com-

mandment concerning the ’small
plates, upon which these things are
engraven.

2 And he gave me, Jacob, a com-
mandment that I should ¢write upon
*these plates a few of the things
which I considered to be most
precious; that I should not touch,
save it were lightly, concerning the
history of this people which are
called the people of Nephi.

3 For he said that the history of his

people should be engraven upon his
“other plates, and that I should ’pre-
serve these plates and hand them
down unto my seed, from generation
to generation.

4 And if there were preaching
which was ‘¢sacred, or revelation
which was great, or prophesying,
that I should engraven the "heads of
them upon these plates, and touch
upon them as much as it were pos-
sible, for Christ’s sake, and for the
sake of our people.

5 For because of faith and great
anxiety, it truly had been made
manifest unto us concerning our
people, what things should “hap-
pen unto them.

6 And we also had many revelations,
and the spirit of much prophecy;
wherefore, we knew of @Christ and
his kingdom, which should come.

7 Wherefore we labored diligently
among our people, that we might
persuade them to ¢come unto Christ,
and partake of the goodness of God,
that they might enter into his ’rest,
lest by any means he should swear
in his wrath they should not ‘enter
in, as in the “provocation in the days
of temptation while the children of
Israel were in the ‘wilderness.

8 Wherefore, we would to God that
we could persuade all men “not to
rebel against God, to *provoke him
to anger, but that all men would be-
lieve in Christ, and view his death,
and suffer his ‘cross and bear the
shame of the world; wherefore, I,

 

118

Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the
commandment of my brother Nephi.

9 Now Nephi began to be old,
and he saw that he must soon “die;
wherefore, he anointed a man to be
a king and a ruler over his people
now, according to the reigns of the
‘kings.

10 The people having loved Nephi
exceedingly, he having been a great
protector for them, having wielded
the “sword of Laban in their defence,
and having labored in all his days
for their welfare—

11 Wherefore, the people were de-
sirous to retain in remembrance his
name. And whoso should reign in
his stead were called by the people,
second Nephi, third Nephi, and so
forth, according to the reigns of the
kings; and thus they were called by
the people, let them be of whatever
name they would.

12 And it came to pass that Nephi
died.

13 Now the people which were not
*Lamanites were Nephites; never-
theless, they were called Nephites,
Jacobites, Josephites, "Zoramites,
Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ish-
maelites.

14 But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter
distinguish “them by these names,
but I shall ’call them Lamanites
that seek to destroy the people of
Nephi, and those who are friendly
to Nephi I shall call ‘Nephites, or
the “people of Nephi, according to
the reigns of the kings.

15 And now it came to pass that
the people of Nephi, under the reign
of the second king, began to grow
hard in their hearts, and indulge
themselves somewhat in wicked
practices, such as like unto David of
old desiring many “wives and ’con-
cubines, and also Solomon, his son.

16 Yea, and they also began to
search much “gold and silver, and
began to be lifted up somewhat
in pride.

17 Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto
them these words as I taught them
in the “temple, having first obtained
mine "errand from the Lord.

18 For I, Jacob, and my brother Jo-
seph had been “consecrated priests
and *teachers of this people, by the
hand of Nephi.

19 And we did “magnify our office
unto the Lord, taking upon us the
’responsibility, answering the sins
of the people upon our own heads if
we did not ‘teach them the word of
God with all diligence; wherefore,
by laboring with our might their
“blood might not come upon our
garments; otherwise their blood
would come upon our garments,
and we would not be found spot-
less at the last day.

CHAPTER 2

Jacob denounces the love of riches,
pride, and unchastity—Men may seek
riches to help their fellowmen—The
Lord commands that no man among
the Nephites may have more than one
wife—T he Lord delights in the chastity
of women. About 544-421 B.c.

 

JACOB 1:15-2:7

THE “words which Jacob, the
brother of Nephi, spake unto the
people of Nephi, after the death
of Nephi:

2 Now, my beloved brethren, I,
Jacob, according to the “responsi-
bility which I am under to God, to
’magnify mine office with ‘sober-
ness, and that I might “rid my gar-
ments of your sins, I come up into
the temple this day that I might
declare unto you the word of God.

3 And ye yourselves know that I
have hitherto been diligent in the
office of my calling; but I this day
am weighed down with much more
desire and anxiety for the *welfare
of your souls than I have hitherto
been.

4 For behold, as yet, ye have been
obedient unto the word of the Lord,
which I have given unto you.

5 But behold, hearken ye unto
me, and know that by the help of
the all-powerful Creator of heaven
and earth I can tell you concerning
your “thoughts, how that ye are be-
ginning to labor in sin, which sin
appeareth very abominable unto
me, yea, and abominable unto God.

6 Yea, it grieveth my soul and
causeth me to shrink with shame
before the presence of my Maker,
that I must testify unto you concern-
ing the wickedness of your hearts.

7 And also it grieveth me that
I must use so much “boldness of
speech concerning you, before your
wives and your children, many of
whose feelings are exceedingly
tender and ’chaste and delicate

before God, which thing is pleas-
ing unto God;

8 And it supposeth me that they
have come up hither to hear the
pleasing ¢word of God, yea, the word
which healeth the wounded soul.

9 Wherefore, it burdeneth my soul
that I should be constrained, be-
cause of the strict commandment
which I have received from God, to
“admonish you according to your
crimes, to enlarge the wounds of
those who are already wounded, in-
stead of consoling and healing their
wounds; and those who have not
been wounded, instead of feasting
upon the pleasing word of God have
daggers placed to pierce their souls
and wound their delicate minds.

10 But, notwithstanding the great-
ness of the task, I must do according
to the strict “commands of God, and
tell you concerning your wickedness
and abominations, in the presence
of the pure in heart, and the broken
heart, and under the glance of the
’piercing eye of the Almighty God.

11 Wherefore, I must tell you the
truth according to the “plainness
of the ’word of God. For behold, as
I inquired of the Lord, thus came
the word unto me, saying: Jacob,
get thou up into the temple on the
morrow, and declare the word which
I shall give thee unto this people.

12 And now behold, my brethren,
this is the word which 1 declare unto
you, that many of you have begun
to search for gold, and for silver, and
for all manner of precious “ores, in
the which this land, which is a *land

 

120

of promise unto you and to your
seed, doth abound most plentifully.

13 And the hand of providence
hath smiled upon you most pleas-
ingly, that you have obtained many
riches; and because some of you have
obtained more abundantly than that
of your brethren ye are “lifted up in
the pride of your hearts, and wear
stiff necks and high heads because
of the costliness of your apparel,
and persecute your brethren be-
cause ye suppose that ye are better
than they.

14 And now, my brethren, do ye
suppose that God justifieth you in
this thing? Behold, I say unto you,
Nay. But he condemneth you, and if
ye persist in these things his judg-
ments must speedily come unto you.

15 O that he would show you that
he can pierce you, and with one
glance of his “eye he can smite you
to the dust!

16 O that he would rid you from
this iniquity and abomination. And,
O that ye would listen unto the
word of his commands, and let not
this “pride of your hearts destroy
your souls!

17 Think of your “brethren like

seek ye for the ‘kingdom of God.

to clothe the naked, and to feed the
hungry, and to liberate the captive,
and administer relief to the sick
and the afflicted.

20 And now, my brethren, I have
spoken unto you concerning pride;
and those of you which have af-
flicted your neighbor, and perse-
cuted him because ye were proud in
your hearts, of the things which God
hath given you, what say ye of it?

21 Do ye not suppose that such
things are abominable unto him
who created all flesh? And the one
being is as precious in his sight as
the other. And all flesh is of the
dust; and for the selfsame end hath
he created them, that they should
keep his “commandments and glo-
rify him forever.

22 And now I make an end of
speaking unto you concerning this
pride. And were it not that I must
speak unto you concerning a grosser
crime, my heart would rejoice ex-
ceedingly because of you.

23 But the word of God burdens
me because of your grosser crimes.
For behold, thus saith the Lord: This
people begin to wax in iniquity; they
understand not the scriptures, for
they seek to excuse themselves in
committing “whoredoms, because of
the things which were written con-
cerning David, and Solomon his son.

24 Behold, David and “Solomon
truly had many wives and concu-
bines, which thing was ‘abominable
before me, saith the Lord.

25 Wherefore, thus saith the Lord,
I have led this people forth out of
the land of Jerusalem, by the power
of mine arm, that I might raise up

 

JACOB 2:20-33

unto me a “righteous branch from
the fruit of the loins of Joseph.

26 Wherefore, I the Lord God will
not suffer that this people shall do
like unto them of old.

27 Wherefore, my brethren, hear
me, and hearken to the word of
the Lord: For there shall not any
4man among you have save it be
bone ‘wife; and concubines he shall
have none;

28 For I, the Lord God, delight in
the “chastity of women. And ’whore-
doms are an abomination before
me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts.

29 Wherefore, this people shall
keep my commandments, saith the
Lord of Hosts, or ¢cursed be the land
for their sakes,

30 For if I will, saith the Lord of
Hosts, raise up “seed unto me, I will
command my people; otherwise
they shall hearken unto these things.

31 For behold, I, the Lord, have
seen the sorrow, and heard the
mourning of the daughters of my
people in the land of Jerusalem,
yea, and in all the lands of my peo-
ple, because of the wickedness and
¢abominations of their "husbands.

32 And I will not suffer, saith the
Lord of Hosts, that the cries of the
fair daughters of this people, which
I have led out of the land of Jerusa-
lem, shall come up unto me against
the men of my people, saith the
Lord of Hosts.

33 For they shall not lead away
captive the daughters of my people
because of their tenderness, save I
shall visit them with a sore curse,
even unto destruction; for they
shall not commit ¢7whoredoms, like

unto them of old, saith the Lord
of Hosts.

34 And now behold, my brethren,
ye know that these commandments
were given to our “father, Lehi;
wherefore, ye have known them be-
fore; and ye have come unto great
condemnation; for ye have done
these things which ye ought not
to have done.

35 Behold, ye have done “greater
iniquities than the Lamanites, our
brethren, Ye have broken the hearts
of your tender wives, and lost the
confidence of your children, be-
cause of your bad examples before
them; and the sobbings of their
hearts ascend up to God against
you. And because of the ’strictness
of the word of God, which cometh
down against you, many hearts died,
pierced with deep wounds.

CHAPTER 3

The pure in heart receive the pleasing
word of God—Lamanite righteousness
exceeds that of the Nephites—Jacob
warns against fornication, lascivious-
ness, and every sin. About 544-421 B.C.

BuT behold, I, Jacob, would speak
unto you that are pure in heart.
Look unto God with firmness of
mind, and “pray unto him with ex-
ceeding faith, and he will ’console
you in your ‘afflictions, and he will
plead your cause, and send down
4justice upon those who seek your
destruction.

2 O all ye that are pure in heart,
lift up your heads and receive the
pleasing word of God, and feast

 

122

upon his “love; for ye may, if your
’minds are ‘firm, forever.

3 But, wo, wo, unto you that are
not pure in heart, that are filthy
this day before God; for except ye
repent the land is “cursed for your
sakes; and the Lamanites, which
are not *filthy like unto you, nev-
ertheless they are ‘cursed with a
sore cursing, shall scourge you even
unto destruction.

4 And the time speedily cometh,
that except ye repent they shall pos-
sess the land of your inheritance,
and the Lord God will “lead away
the righteous out from among you.

5 Behold, the Lamanites your
brethren, whom ye hate because
of their filthiness and the cursing
which hath come upon their skins,
are more righteous than you; for they
have not “forgotten the command-
ment of the Lord, which was given
unto our father—that they should
have save it were °one wife, and
“concubines they should have none,
and there should not be “whoredoms
committed among them.

6 And now, this commandment
they observe to keep; wherefore,
because of this observance, in keep-
ing this commandment, the Lord
God will not destroy them, but will
be “merciful unto them; and one
day they shall "become a blessed
people.

7 Behold, their “husbands "love
their ‘wives, and their wives love their
husbands; and their husbands and
their wives love their children;
and their “unbelief and their hatred
towards you is because of the in-
iquity of their fathers; wherefore,

how much better are you than they,
in the sight of your great Creator?

8 O my brethren, I fear that unless
ye shall repent of your sins that their
skins will be “whiter than yours,
when ye shall be brought with them
before the throne of God.

9 Wherefore, a commandment I
give unto you, which is the word
of God, that ye “revile no more
against them because of the dark-
ness of their skins; neither shall ye
revile against them because of their
filthiness; but ye shall remember
your own filthiness, and remember
that their filthiness came because
of their fathers.

10 Wherefore, ye shall remember
your “children, how that ye have
grieved their hearts because of the
‘example that ye have set before
them; and also, remember that ye
may, because of your filthiness,
bring your children unto destruc-
tion, and their sins be heaped upon
your heads at the last day.

11 O my brethren, hearken unto
my words; “arouse the faculties of
your souls; shake yourselves that
ye may "awake from the slumber
of death; and loose yourselves from
the pains of ‘hell that ye may not
become “angels to the devil, to be
cast into that lake of fire and brim-
stone which is the second “death.

12 And now I, Jacob, spake many
more things unto the people of
Nephi, “warning them against ’for-
nication and ‘lasciviousness, and
every kind of sin, telling them the
awful consequences of them.

13 And a hundredth part of the
proceedings of this people, which
now began to be numerous, can-
not be written upon “these plates;

 

JACOB 3:8-4:3

but many of their proceedings are
written upon the "larger plates, and
their wars, and their contentions,
and the reigns of their kings.

14 *These plates are called the
plates of Jacob, and they were *’made
by the hand of Nephi. And I make
an end of speaking these words.

CHAPTER 4

All the prophets worshiped the Father
in the name of Christ—Abraham’s of-
fering of Isaac was in similitude of God
and His Only Begotten—Men should
reconcile themselves to God through the
Atonement—The Jews will reject the
foundation stone. About 544-421 B.c.

Now behold, it came to pass that
I, Jacob, having ministered much
unto my people in word, (and I
cannot write but a “little of my
words, because of the difficulty of
engraving our words upon plates)
and we know that the things which
we write upon plates must remain;

2 But whatsoever things we write
upon anything save it be upon
“plates must perish and vanish away;
but we can write a few words upon
plates, which will give our chil-
dren, and also our beloved breth-
ren, a small degree of knowledge
concerning us, or concerning their
fathers—

3 Now in this thing we do rejoice;
and we labor diligently to engraven
these words upon plates, hoping
that our beloved brethren and our
children will receive them with
thankful hearts, and look upon
them that they may learn with joy
and not with sorrow, neither with
contempt, concerning their first
“parents.

4 For, for this intent have we writ-
ten these things, that they may
know that we “knew of Christ, and
we had a hope of his glory many
hundred years before his coming;
and not only we ourselves had a
hope of his glory, but also all the
holy “prophets which were before us.

5 Behold, they believed in Christ
and “worshiped the Father in his
name, and also we worship the
Father in his "name. And for this
intent we ‘keep the “law of Moses,
it ‘pointing our souls to him; and
for this cause it is sanctified unto
us for righteousness, even as it was
accounted unto Abraham in the
wilderness to be obedient unto the
commands of God in offering up his
son Isaac, which is a ‘similitude of
God and his ¢Only Begotten Son.

6 Wherefore, we search the proph-
ets, and we have many revelations
and the spirit of “prophecy; and
having all these "witnesses we ob-
tain a hope, and our faith becometh
unshaken, insomuch that we truly
can ‘command in the “name of
Jesus and the very trees obey us,
or the mountains, or the waves of
the sea.

7 Nevertheless, the Lord God
showeth us our “weakness that we

 

124

may know that it is by his grace,
and his great condescensions unto
the children of men, that we have
power to do these things.

8 Behold, great and marvelous are
the “works of the Lord. How °un-
searchable are the depths of the
‘mysteries of him; and it is impos-
sible that man should find out all
his ways. And no man “knoweth
of his ‘ways save it be revealed unto
him; wherefore, brethren, despise
not the ‘revelations of God.

9 For behold, by the power of his
“word ’man came upon the face of
the earth, which earth was ‘created
by the power of his word. Where-
fore, if God being able to speak and
the world was, and to speak and man
was created, O then, why not able
to command the “earth, or the
workmanship of his hands upon
the face of it, according to his will
and pleasure?

10 Wherefore, brethren, seek not to
“counsel the Lord, but to take coun-
sel from his hand. For behold, ye
yourselves know that he counseleth
in wisdom, and in justice, and in
great mercy, over all his works.

11 Wherefore, beloved brethren,
be “reconciled unto him through
the ’atonement of Christ, his ‘Only

a “resurrection, according to the
‘power of the resurrection which
is in Christ, and be presented as
the ‘first-fruits of Christ unto God,
having faith, and obtained a good
hope of glory in him before he
manifesteth himself in the flesh.

12 And now, beloved, marvel not
that I tell you these things; for
why not “speak of the atonement
of Christ, and attain to a perfect
knowledge of him, as to attain to
the knowledge of a resurrection
and the world to come?

13 Behold, my brethren, he that
prophesieth, let him prophesy to the
understanding of men; for the “Spirit
speaketh the truth and lieth not.
Wherefore, it speaketh of things as
they really ‘are, and of things as they
really will be; wherefore, these things
are manifested unto us “plainly,
for the salvation of our souls. But
behold, we are not witnesses alone
in these things; for God also “spake
them unto prophets of old.

14 But behold, the Jews were a
“stiffnecked people; and they °de-
spised the words of ‘plainness, and
4killed the prophets, and sought for
things that they could not under-
stand. Wherefore, because of their
“blindness, which ‘blindness came
by looking beyond the «mark, they
must needs fall; for God hath taken
away his plainness from them, and
delivered unto them many things
which they "cannot understand, be-

 

JACOB 4:12-18

cause they desired it. And because
they desired it God hath done it,
that they may ‘stumble.

15 And now I, Jacob, am led on by
the Spirit unto prophesying; for I
perceive by the workings of the Spirit
which is in me, that by the “stum-
bling of the "Jews they will ‘reject
the ‘stone upon which they might
build and have safe foundation.

16 But behold, according to the
scriptures, this “stone shall become
the great, and the last, and the only
sure "foundation, upon which the
Jews can build.

17 And now, my beloved, how is
it possible that these, after having
rejected the sure foundation, can
“ever build upon it, that it may be-
come the head of their corner?

18 Behold, my beloved brethren,
I will unfold this mystery unto
you; if 1 do not, by any means, get
shaken from my firmness in the
Spirit, and stumble because of my
over anxiety for you.

BEHOLD, my brethren, do ye not re-
member to have read the words of
the prophet ¢Zenos, which he spake
unto the house of Israel, saying:

2 Hearken, O ye house of Israel,
and hear the words of me, a prophet
of the Lord.

3 For behold, thus saith the Lord,
I will liken thee, O house of “Israel,
like unto a tame "olive tree, which
a man took and nourished in his
‘vineyard; and it grew, and waxed
old, and began to “decay.

4 And it came to pass that the mas-
ter of the vineyard went forth, and
he saw that his olive tree began to
decay; and he said: I will “prune
it, and dig about it, and nourish
it, that perhaps it may shoot forth
young and tender branches, and it
perish not.

5 And it came to pass that he
“pruned it, and digged about it, and
nourished it according to his word.

6 And it came to pass that after
many days it began to put forth
somewhat a little, young and tender
branches; but behold, the main “top
thereof began to perish.

7 And it came to pass that the mas-
ter of the vineyard saw it, and he
said unto his “servant: It grieveth me
that I should lose this tree; where-
fore, go and pluck the branches from
a wild olive tree, and bring them
hither unto me; and we will pluck
off those main branches which are
beginning to wither away, and we
will cast them into the fire that
they may be burned.

8 And behold, saith the Lord of
the vineyard, I take “away many of
these young and tender branches,
and I will graft them 'whitherso-
ever I will; and it mattereth not that

 

126

if it so be that the root of this tree
will perish, I may preserve the fruit
thereof unto myself; wherefore, I
will take these young and tender
branches, and I will graft them
whithersoever I will.

9 Take thou the branches of the
wild olive tree, and graft them in, in
the “stead thereof; and these which
I have plucked off I will cast into
the fire and burn them, that they
may not cumber the ground of my
vineyard.

10 And it came to pass that the
servant of the Lord of the vine-
yard did according to the word
of the Lord of the vineyard, and
grafted in the branches of the wild
olive tree.

11 And the Lord of the vineyard
caused that it should be digged
about, and pruned, and nourished,
saying unto his servant: It grieveth
me that I should lose this tree; where-
fore, that perhaps I might preserve
the roots thereof that they perish
not, that I might preserve them
unto myself, I have done this thing.

12 Wherefore, go thy way; watch
the tree, and nourish it, according
to my words.

13 And these will I ¢place in the
nethermost part of my vineyard,
whithersoever I will, it mattereth
not unto thee; and I do it that I may
preserve unto myself the natural
branches of the tree; and also, that I
may lay up fruit thereof against the
season, unto myself; for it grieveth
me that I should lose this tree and
the fruit thereof.

14 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard went his way,
and hid the natural “branches of the
tame olive tree in the nethermost

parts of the vineyard, some in one
and some in another, according to
his will and pleasure.

15 And it came to pass that a long
time passed away, and the Lord
of the vineyard said unto his ser-
vant: Come, let us go down into
the vineyard, that we may “labor
in the vineyard.

16 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard, and also the
servant, went down into the vine-
yard to labor. And it came to pass
that the servant said unto his master:
Behold, look here; behold the tree.

17 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard looked and be-
held the tree in the which the wild
olive branches had been grafted;
and it had sprung forth and begun
to bear “fruit. And he beheld that it
was good; and the fruit thereof was
like unto the natural fruit.

18 And he said unto the servant:
Behold, the branches of the wild
tree have taken hold of the mois-
ture of the root thereof, that the
root thereof hath brought forth
much strength; and because of the
much strength of the root thereof
the wild branches have brought
forth tame fruit. Now, if we had not
grafted in these branches, the tree
thereof would have perished. And
now, behold, I shall lay up much
fruit, which the tree thereof hath
brought forth; and the fruit thereof
I shall lay up against the season,
unto mine own self.

19 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard said unto
the servant: Come, let us go to the
nethermost part of the vineyard,
and behold if the natural branches
of the tree have not brought forth
much fruit also, that I may lay up
of the fruit thereof against the sea-
son, unto mine own self.

20 And it came to pass that they

 

JACOB 5:15-25

went forth whither the master had
hid the natural branches of the
tree, and he said unto the servant:
Behold these; and he beheld the
“first that it had °brought forth
much fruit; and he beheld also that
it was good. And he said unto the
servant: Take of the fruit thereof,
and lay it up against the season,
that I may preserve it unto mine
own self; for behold, said he, this
long time have I nourished it, and
it hath brought forth much fruit.

21 And it came to pass that the
servant said unto his master: How
comest thou hither to plant this
tree, or this branch of the tree? For
behold, it was the poorest spot in
all the land of thy vineyard.

22 And the Lord of the vineyard
said unto him: Counsel me not; I
knew that it was a poor spot of
ground; wherefore, I said unto thee,
I have nourished it this long time,
and thou beholdest that it hath
brought forth much fruit.

23 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard said unto his
servant: Look hither; behold I have
planted another branch of the tree
also; and thou knowest that this spot
of ground was poorer than the first.
But, behold the tree. I have nour-
ished it this long time, and it hath
brought forth much fruit; therefore,
gather it, and lay it up against the
season, that I may preserve it unto
mine own self.

24 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard said again unto
his servant: Look hither, and behold
another “branch also, which I have
planted; behold that I have nour-
ished it also, and it hath brought
forth fruit.

25 And he said unto the servant:
Look hither and behold the last.
Behold, this have I planted in a
*g00d spot of ground; and I have

nourished it this long time, and
only a ’part of the tree hath brought
forth tame fruit, and the ‘other part
of the tree hath brought forth wild
fruit; behold, Ihave nourished this
tree like unto the others.

26 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard said unto the
servant: Pluck off the branches that
have not brought forth good “fruit,
and cast them into the fire.

27 But behold, the servant said
unto him: Let us prune it, and dig
about it, and nourish it a little “lon-
ger, that perhaps it may bring forth
good fruit unto thee, that thou canst
lay it up against the season.

28 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard and the ser-
vant of the Lord of the vineyard did
nourish all the fruit of the vineyard.

29 And it came to pass that a “long
time had passed away, and the Lord
of the vineyard said unto his °ser-
vant: Come, let us go down into the
vineyard, that we may labor again
in the vineyard. For behold, the
time draweth near, and the ‘end
soon cometh; wherefore, I must lay
up fruit against the season, unto
mine own self.

30 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard and the ser-
vant went down into the vineyard;
and they came to the tree whose
natural branches had been broken
off, and the wild branches had been
grafted in; and behold all “sorts of
fruit did cumber the tree.

31 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard did “taste of
the fruit, every sort according to its
number. And the Lord of the vine-
yard said: Behold, this long time
have we nourished this tree, and
I have laid up unto myself against
the season much fruit.

32 But behold, this time it hath
brought forth much “fruit, and there

 

128

is ’none of it which is good. And
behold, there are all kinds of bad
fruit; and it profiteth me nothing,
notwithstanding all our labor; and
now it grieveth me that I should
lose this tree.

33 And the Lord of the vineyard
said unto the servant: What shall
we do unto the tree, that I may pre-
serve again good fruit thereof unto
mine own self?

34 And the servant said unto his
master: Behold, because thou didst
graft in the branches of the wild
olive tree they have nourished the
roots, that they are alive and they
have not perished; wherefore thou
beholdest that they are yet good.

35 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard said unto his
servant: The tree profiteth me noth-
ing, and the roots thereof profit me
nothing so long as it shall bring
forth evil fruit.

36 Nevertheless, I know that the
roots are good, and for mine own
purpose I have preserved them; and
because of their much strength they
have hitherto brought forth, from
the wild branches, good fruit.

37 But behold, the wild branches
have grown and have “overrun the
roots thereof; and because that
the wild branches have overcome the
roots thereof it hath brought forth
much evil fruit; and because that
it hath brought forth so much evil
fruit thou beholdest that it begin-
neth to perish; and it will soon be-
come ripened, that it may be cast
into the fire, except we should do
something for it to preserve it.

38 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard said unto his
servant: Let us go down into the
nethermost parts of the vineyard,
and behold if the natural branches
have also brought forth evil fruit.

39 And it came to pass that they

went down into the nethermost
parts of the vineyard. And it came
to pass that they beheld that the
fruit of the natural branches had
become corrupt also; yea, the “first
and the second and also the last;
and they had all become corrupt.

40 And the ¢wild fruit of the last
had overcome that part of the tree
which brought forth good fruit,
even that the branch had withered
away and died.

41 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard wept, and
said unto the servant: ?What could
Lhave done more for my vineyard?

42 Behold, I knew that all the fruit of
the vineyard, save it were these, had
become “corrupted. And now these
which have once brought forth good
fruit have also become corrupted;
and now all the trees of my vineyard
are good for nothing save it be to be
*’hewn down and cast into the fire.

43 And behold this last, whose
branch hath withered away, I did
plant in a“good spot of ground; yea,
even that which was choice unto me
above all other parts of the land of
my vineyard.

44 And thou beheldest that I also
cut down that which “cumbered
this spot of ground, that I might
plant this tree in the stead thereof.

45 And thou beheldest that a “part
thereof brought forth good fruit,
and a part thereof brought forth
wild fruit; and because I plucked
not the branches thereof and cast
them into the fire, behold, they have
overcome the good branch that it
hath withered away.

46 And now, behold, notwithstand-
ing all the care which we have taken
of my vineyard, the trees thereof
have become corrupted, that they

 

JACOB 5:40-50

bring forth no good “fruit; and these
I had hoped to preserve, to have laid
up fruit thereof against the season,
unto mine own self, But, behold,
they have become like unto the
wild olive tree, and they are of no
worth but to be "hewn down and
cast into the fire; and it grieveth
me that I should lose them.

47 But “what could I have done
more in my vineyard? Have I slack-
ened mine hand, that I have not
nourished it? Nay, I have nourished
it, and I have digged about it, and I
have pruned it, and I have dunged
it; and I have stretched forth mine
‘hand almost all the day long, and
the “end draweth nigh. And it griev-
eth me that I should hew down all
the trees of my vineyard, and cast
them into the fire that they should
be burned. Who is it that has cor-
rupted my vineyard?

48 And it came to pass that the ser-
vant said unto his master: Is it not
the “loftiness of thy vineyard—have
not the branches thereof overcome
the roots which are good? And be-
cause the branches have overcome
the roots thereof, behold they grew
faster than the strength of the roots,
’taking strength unto themselves.
Behold, I say, is not this the cause
that the trees of thy vineyard have
become corrupted?

49 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard said unto the
servant: Let us go to and hew down
the trees of the vineyard and cast
them into the fire, that they shall
not cumber the ground of my vine-
yard, for I have done all. What could
Ihave done more for my vineyard?

50 But, behold, the servant said
unto the Lord of the vineyard: Spare
it a little “longer.

51 And the Lord said: Yea, I will
spare it a little longer, for it griev-
eth me that I should lose the trees
of my vineyard.

52 Wherefore, let us take of the
“branches of these which I have
planted in the nethermost parts of
my vineyard, and let us graft them
into the tree from whence they came;
and let us pluck from the tree those
branches whose fruit is most bitter,
and graft in the natural branches of
the tree in the stead thereof.

53 And this will I do that the tree
may not perish, that, perhaps, I
may preserve unto myself the roots
thereof for mine “own purpose.

54 And, behold, the roots of the
natural branches of the tree which
I planted whithersoever I would are
yet alive; wherefore, that I may pre-
serve them also for mine own pur-
pose, I will take of the “branches of
this tree, and I will °graft them in
unto them. Yea, I will graft in unto
them the branches of their mother
tree, that I may preserve the roots
also unto mine own self, that when
they shall be sufficiently strong
perhaps they may bring forth good
fruit unto me, and I may yet have
glory in the fruit of my vineyard.

55 And it came to pass that they
took from the natural tree which
had become wild, and grafted in
unto the natural trees, which also
had become wild.

56 And they also took of the natu-
ral trees which had become wild,
and “grafted into their mother tree.

57 And the Lord of the vineyard
said unto the servant: Pluck not the
wild branches from the trees, save
it be those which are most bitter;
and in them ye shall graft accord-
ing to that which I have said.

 

130

58 And we will nourish again the
trees of the vineyard, and we will
trim up the “branches thereof; and
we will pluck from the trees those
branches which are ripened, that
must perish, and cast them into
the fire.

59 And this I do that, perhaps, the
roots thereof may take strength be-
cause of their goodness; and because
of the change of the branches, that
the good may “overcome the evil.

60 And because that I have pre-
served the natural branches and
the roots thereof, and that I have
grafted in the natural branches again
into their mother tree, and have
preserved the roots of their mother
tree, that, perhaps, the trees of my
vineyard may bring forth again
good “fruit; and that I may have joy
again in the fruit of my vineyard,
and, perhaps, that I may rejoice
exceedingly that I have preserved
the roots and the branches of the
first fruit—

61 Wherefore, go to, and call 4ser-
vants, that we may “labor diligently
with our might in the vineyard, that
we may ‘prepare the way, that I may
bring forth again the natural fruit,
which natural fruit is good and the
most precious above all other fruit.

62 Wherefore, let us go to and la-
bor with our might this last time,
for behold the end draweth nigh,
and this is for the last time that I
shall “prune my vineyard.

63 Graft in the branches; begin at
the “last that they may be first, and
that the first may be °last, and dig
about the trees, both old and young,
the first and the last; and the last
and the first, that all may be nour-
ished once again for the last time.

64 Wherefore, dig about them,

and prune them, and dung them
once more, for the last time, for
the end draweth nigh. And if it be
so that these last grafts shall grow,
and bring forth the natural fruit,
then shall ye prepare the way for
them, that they may grow.

65 And as they begin to grow
ye shall *clear away the branches
which bring forth bitter fruit, ac-
cording to the strength of the good
and the size thereof; and ye shall
not clear away the bad thereof all
at once, lest the roots thereof should
be too strong for the graft, and the
graft thereof shall perish, and I lose
the trees of my vineyard.

66 For it grieveth me that I should
lose the trees of my vineyard; where-
fore ye shall clear away the bad ac-
cording as the good shall grow, that
the root and the top may be equal
in strength, until the good shall
overcome the bad, and the bad be
hewn down and cast into the fire,
that they cumber not the ground of
my vineyard; and thus will Il sweep
away the bad out of my vineyard.

67 And the branches of the nat-
ural tree will I graft in again into
the natural tree;

68 And the branches of the natu-
ral tree willl graft into the natural
branches of the tree; and thus will
I bring them together again, that
they shall bring forth the natural
“fruit, and they shall be one.

69 And the bad shall be “cast away,
yea, even out of all the land of my
vineyard; for behold, only this once
will | prune my vineyard.

70 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard sent his ¢ser-
vant; and the servant went and did
as the Lord had commanded him,
and brought other ’servants; and
they were “few.

71 And the Lord of the vineyard

 

JACOB 5:65-75

said unto them: Go to, and “labor
in the vineyard, with your might.
For behold, this is the °last time
that I shall ‘nourish my vineyard;
for the end is nigh at hand, and the
season speedily cometh; and if ye
labor with your might with me
ye shall have joy in the fruit which
I shall lay up unto myself against
the time which will soon come.

72 And it came to pass that the
servants did go and labor with their
mights; and the Lord of the vineyard
labored also with them; and they
did obey the commandments of the
Lord of the vineyard in all things.

73 And there began to be the natu-
ral fruit again in the vineyard; and
the natural branches began to grow
and thrive exceedingly; and the wild
branches began to be plucked off
and to be cast away; and they did
keep the root and the top thereof
equal, according to the strength
thereof.

74 And thus they labored, with
all diligence, according to the com-
mandments of the Lord of the vine-
yard, even until the bad had been
cast away out of the vineyard, and
the Lord had preserved unto himself
that the trees had become again the
natural fruit; and they became like
unto Zone body; and the fruits were
equal; and the Lord of the vineyard
had preserved unto himself the natu-
ral fruit, which was most precious
unto him from the beginning.

75 And it came to pass that when
the “Lord of the vineyard saw that
his fruit was good, and that his
vineyard was no more corrupt, he
called up his servants, and said unto
them: Behold, for this last time have
we nourished my vineyard; and
thou beholdest that I have done
according to my will; and I have
preserved the natural fruit, that it

is good, even like as it was in the
beginning. And "blessed art thou;
for because ye have been diligent in
laboring with me in my vineyard,
and have kept my commandments,
and have brought unto me again
the ‘natural fruit, that my vineyard
is no more corrupted, and the bad
is cast away, behold ye shall have
4joy with me because of the fruit
of my vineyard.

76 For behold, for a “long time will
I lay up of the fruit of my vineyard
unto mine own self against the sea-
son, which speedily cometh; and for
the last time have I nourished my
vineyard, and pruned it, and dug
about it, and dunged it; wherefore
I will lay up unto mine own self of
the fruit, for a long time, according
to that which I have spoken.

77 And when the time cometh that
evil fruit shall again come into my
vineyard, then will 1 cause the “good
and the bad to be gathered; and the
good willl preserve unto myself, and
the bad willl cast away into its own
place. And then cometh the "season
and the end; and my vineyard will
I cause to be ‘burned with “fire.

CHAPTER 6

The Lord will recover Israel in the last
days—The world will be burned with
fire—Men must follow Christ to avoid
the lake of fire and brimstone. About
544-421 B.C.

 

132

AND now, behold, my brethren, as I
said unto you that I would proph-
esy, behold, this is my prophecy—
that the things which this prophet
*Zenos spake, concerning the house
of Israel, in the which he likened
them unto a tame °olive tree, must
surely come to pass.

2 And the day that he shall set
his hand again the second time to
“recover his people, is the day, yea,
even the last time, that the °ser-
vants of the Lord shall go forth in
his ‘power, to “nourish and prune
his ‘vineyard; and after that the
fend soon cometh.

3 And how “blessed are they who
have labored diligently in his vine-
yard; and how ‘cursed are they who
shall be cast out into their own
place! And the “world shall be
‘burned with fire.

4 And how merciful is our God
unto us, for he remembereth the
house of “Israel, both roots and
branches; and he stretches forth his
bhands unto them all the day long;
and they are a ‘stiffnecked and a
gainsaying people; but as many as
will not harden their hearts shall
be saved in the kingdom of God.

5 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, I beseech of you in words of
soberness that ye would repent, and
come with full purpose of heart,
and “cleave unto God as he cleaveth
unto you. And while his ’arm of
mercy is extended towards you in

the light of the day, harden not
your hearts.

6 Yea, today, if ye will hear his
voice, harden not your hearts; for
why will ye “die?

7 For behold, after ye have been
nourished by the good “word of God
all the day long, will ye bring forth
evil fruit, that ye must be "hewn
down and cast into the fire?

8 Behold, will ye reject these
words? Will ye reject the words of
the “prophets; and will ye reject all
the words which have been spoken
concerning Christ, after so many
have spoken concerning him; and
’deny the good word of Christ, and
the power of God, and the ‘gift of
the Holy Ghost, and quench the
Holy Spirit, and make a ¢mock of
the great plan of redemption, which
hath been laid for you?

9 Know ye not that if ye will do
these things, that the power of the
redemption and the resurrection,
which is in Christ, will bring you
to stand with “shame and ’awful
‘guilt before the bar of God?

10 And according to the power of
“justice, for justice cannot be denied,
ye must go away into that ’lake of
fire and brimstone, whose flames
are unquenchable, and whose smoke
ascendeth up forever and ever,
which lake of fire and brimstone
is “endless “torment.

11 O then, my beloved brethren,
repent ye, and enter in at the “strait
gate, and "continue in the way

CHAPTER 7

Sherem denies Christ, contends with
Jacob, demands a sign, and is smitten
of God—All of the prophets have spo-
ken of Christ and His Atonement—T he
Nephites lived out their days as wan-
derers, born in tribulation, and hated
by the Lamanites. About 544-421 B.c.

AND now it came to pass after some
years had passed away, there came
aman among the people of Nephi,
whose name was “Sherem.

2 And it came to pass that he
began to preach among the peo-
ple, and to declare unto them that
there should be “no Christ. And he
preached many things which were
flattering unto the people; and this
he did that he might overthrow the
doctrine of Christ.

3 And he labored diligently that he
might lead away the hearts of the
people, insomuch that he did lead
away many hearts; and he knowing
that I, Jacob, had faith in Christ who
should come, he sought much oppotr-
tunity that he might come unto me.

4 And he was “learned, that he
had a perfect knowledge of the lan-
guage of the people; wherefore, he
could use much "flattery, and much
power of speech, according to the
“power of the devil.

5 And he had hope to shake me
from the faith, notwithstanding the
many “revelations and the many
things which I had seen concerning

these things; for I truly had seen
bangels, and they had ministered
unto me. And also, I had ‘heard the
voice of the Lord speaking unto me
in very word, from time to time;
wherefore, I could not be shaken,

6 And it came to pass that he came
unto me, and on this wise did he
speak unto me, saying: Brother Ja-
cob, I have sought much opportu-
nity that I might speak unto you;
for I have heard and also know that
thou goest about much, preaching
that which ye call the “gospel, or
the doctrine of Christ.

7 And ye have led away much of
this people that they pervert the
right way of God, and “keep not
the law of Moses which is the right
way; and convert the law of Moses
into the worship of a being which
ye say shall come many hundred
years hence. And now behold, I,
Sherem, declare unto you that this
is "blasphemy; for no man knoweth
of such things; for he cannot ‘tell of
things to come. And after this man-
ner did Sherem contend against me.

8 But behold, the Lord God poured
in his *Spirit into my soul, inso-
much that I did ’confound him in
all his words.

9 And I said unto him: Deniest thou
the Christ who shall come? And he
said: If there should be a Christ, I
would not deny him; but I know
that there is no Christ, neither has
been, nor ever will be.

10 And I said unto him: Believest
thou the scriptures? And he said,
Yea.

11 And I said unto him: Then ye do
not understand them; for they truly
testify of Christ. Behold, I say unto

 

134

you that none of the “prophets have
written, nor "prophesied, save they
have spoken concerning this Christ.

12 And this is not all—it has been
made manifest unto me, for I have
heard and seen; and it also has been
made manifest unto me by the
“power of the Holy Ghost; where-
fore, I know if there should be no
atonement made all mankind must
be "lost.

13 And it came to pass that he
said unto me: Show me a “sign by
this power of the Holy Ghost, in the
which ye know so much.

14 And I said unto him: What am
I that I should “tempt God to show
unto thee a sign in the thing which
thou knowest to be ’true? Yet thou
wilt deny it, because thou art of the
‘devil. Nevertheless, not my will be
done; but if God shall smite thee,
let that be a “sign unto thee that
he has power, both in heaven and
in earth; and also, that Christ shall
come. And thy will, O Lord, be done,
and not mine.

15 And it came to pass that when I,
Jacob, had spoken these words, the
power of the Lord came upon him,
insomuch that he fell to the earth.
And it came to pass that he was nour-
ished for the space of many days.

16 And it came to pass that he said
unto the people: Gather together on
the morrow, for I shall die; where-
fore, I desire to speak unto the
people before I shall die.

17 And it came to pass that on the
morrow the multitude were gath-
ered together; and he spake plainly
unto them and denied the things
which he had taught them, and
confessed the Christ, and the power

of the Holy Ghost, and the minis-
tering of angels.

18 And he spake plainly unto
them, that he had been “deceived
by the power of the "devil. And he
spake of hell, and of ‘eternity, and
of eternal ‘punishment.

19 And he said: I “fear lest I have
committed the unpardonable sin,
for I have lied unto God; for I de-
nied the Christ, and said that I be-
lieved the scriptures; and they truly
testify of him. And because I have
thus lied unto God I greatly fear
lest my case shall be ‘awful; but I
confess unto God.

20 And it came to pass that when
he had said these words he could say
no more, and he @gave up the "ghost.

21 And when the multitude had
witnessed that he spake these things
as he was about to give up the ghost,
they were astonished exceedingly;
insomuch that the power of God
came down upon them, and they
were “overcome that they fell to
the earth.

22 Now, this thing was pleasing
unto me, Jacob, for I had requested
it of my Father who was in heaven;
for he had heard my cry and an-
swered my prayer.

23 And it came to pass that peace
and the “love of God was restored
again among the people; and they
’searched the scriptures, and heark-
ened no more to the words of this
wicked man.

24 And it came to pass that many
means were devised to “reclaim
and restore the Lamanites to the
knowledge of the truth; but it all

JACOB 7:18-27

was vain, for they delighted in
‘wars and “bloodshed, and they had
an eternal “hatred against us, their
brethren. And they sought by the
power of their arms to destroy us
continually.

25 Wherefore, the people of Nephi
did fortify against them with their
arms, and with all their might, trust-
ing in the God and “rock of their
salvation; wherefore, they became
as yet, conquerors of their enemies.

26 And it came to pass that I,
Jacob, began to be old; and the
record of this people being kept on
the “other plates of Nephi, where-
fore, Iconclude this record, declar-
ing that I have written according to
the best of my knowledge, by say-
ing that the time passed away with
us, and also our *lives passed away
like as it were unto us a “dream, we
being a “lonesome and a solemn
people, ‘wanderers, cast out from
Jerusalem, born in tribulation, ina
wilderness, and hated of our breth-
ren, which caused wars and conten-
tions; wherefore, we did mourn out
our days.

27 And I, Jacob, saw that I must
soon go down to my grave; where-
fore, Isaid unto my son “Enos: Take
these "plates. And I told him the
things which my brother Nephi
had ‘commanded me, and he prom-
ised obedience unto the commands.
And I make an end of my writing
upon these plates, which writing
has been ¢small; and to the reader
I bid farewell, hoping that many of
my brethren may read my words.
Brethren, adieu.

THE BOOK OF ENOS

Enos prays mightily and gains a re-
mission of his sins—The voice of the
Lord comes into his mind, promising
salvation for the Lamanites in a future
day—The Nephites sought to reclaim
the Lamanites—Enos rejoices in his
Redeemer. About 420 B.C.

I, “Enos, knowing my father

that "he was a just man—for
he ‘taught me in his language, and
also in the ‘nurture and admoni-
tion of the Lord—and blessed be
the name of my God for it—

2 And I will tell you of the ¢wres-
tle which I had before God, before
I received a *remission of my sins.

3 Behold, I went to hunt beasts in
the forests; and the words which I
had often heard my father speak
concerning eternal life, and the “joy
of the saints, "sunk deep into my
heart.

4 And my soul “hungered; and I
’kneeled down before my Maker,
and I ‘cried unto him in mighty
4prayer and supplication for mine
own soul; and all the day long did
Icry unto him; yea, and when the
night came I did still raise my voice
high that it reached the heavens.

5 And there came a “voice unto me,
saying: Enos, thy sins are *forgiven
thee, and thou shalt be blessed.

Biceee it came to pass that

 

6 And I, Enos, knew that God
“could not lie; wherefore, my guilt
was swept away.

7 And I said: Lord, how is it done?

8 And he said unto me: “Because
of thy °faith in Christ, whom thou
hast never before heard nor seen.
And many years pass away before
he shall manifest himself in the
flesh; wherefore, go to, thy faith
hath made thee ‘whole.

9 Now, it came to pass that when
I had heard these words I began to
feel a “desire for the ’welfare of my
brethren, the Nephites; wherefore,
I did ‘pour out my whole soul unto
God for them.

10 And while I was thus strug-
gling in the spirit, behold, the voice
of the Lord came into my “mind
again, saying: I will visit thy breth-
ren according to their diligence in
keeping my commandments. I have
’siven unto them this land, and it
is a holy land; and I ‘curse it not
save it be for the cause of iniquity;
wherefore, I will visit thy breth-
ren according as I have said; and
their “transgressions will I bring
down with sorrow upon their own
heads.

11 And after I, Enos, had heard
these words, my “faith began to
be 'unshaken in the Lord; and I
‘prayed unto him with many long

4strugglings for my brethren, the
Lamanites.

12 And it came to pass that after
I had “prayed and labored with all
diligence, the Lord said unto me: I
will grant unto thee according to
thy desires, because of thy faith.

13 And now behold, this was the
desire which I desired of him—that
if it should so be, that my people,
the Nephites, should fall into trans-
gression, and by any means be @de-
stroyed, and the Lamanites should
not be ’destroyed, that the Lord
God would ‘preserve a record of
my people, the Nephites; even if it
so be by the power of his holy arm,
that it might be “brought forth at
some future day unto the Laman-
ites, that, perhaps, they might be
“brought unto salvation—

14 For at the present our strug-
glings were “vain in restoring them
to the true faith. And they swore in
their wrath that, if it were possible,
they would ’destroy our records
and us, and also all the traditions
of our fathers.

15 Wherefore, I knowing that the
Lord God was able to “preserve our
records, I cried unto him continu-
ally, for he had said unto me: What-
soever thing ye shall ask in faith,
believing that ye shall receive in the
name of Christ, ye shall receive it.

16 And I had faith, and I did cry
unto God that he would “preserve
the ’records; and he covenanted
with me that he would ‘bring ‘them
forth unto the Lamanites in his own
due time.

 

ENOS 1:12-22

17 And I, Enos, “knew it would be
according to the covenant which
he had made; wherefore my soul
did rest.

18 And the Lord said unto me:
Thy fathers have also required of
me this thing; and it shall be done
unto them according to their faith;
for their faith was like unto thine.

19 And now it came to pass that I,
Enos, went about among the people
of Nephi, prophesying of things to
come, and testifying of the things
which I had heard and seen.

20 And I bear record that the
people of Nephi did seek diligently
to “restore the Lamanites unto
the true faith in God. But our "la-
bors were vain; their “hatred was
fixed, and they were led by their
evil nature that they became wild,
and ferocious, and a “blood-thirsty
people, full of ‘idolatry and ‘filthi-
ness; feeding upon beasts of prey;
dwelling in *tents, and wandering
about in the wilderness with a short
skin girdle about their loins and
their heads shaven; and their skill
was in the "bow, and in the cimeter,
and the ax. And many of them did
eat nothing save it was raw meat;
and they were continually seeking
to destroy us.

21 And it came to pass that the
people of Nephi did till the land,
and “raise all manner of grain, and
of fruit, and ’flocks of herds, and
flocks of all manner of cattle of ev-
ery kind, and goats, and wild goats,
and also many horses.

many “prophets among us. And the
people were a ’stiffnecked people,
hard to understand.

23 And there was nothing save it
was exceeding “harshness, ’preach-
ing and prophesying of wars, and
contentions, and destructions, and
continually ‘reminding them of
death, and the duration of eternity,
and the judgments and the power of
God, and all these things—stirring
them up “continually to keep them
in the fear of the Lord. I say there
was nothing short of these things,
and exceedingly great plainness of
speech, would keep them from go-
ing down speedily to destruction.
And after this manner do I write
concerning them.

24 And I saw “wars between the
Nephites and Lamanites in the
course of my days.

25 And it came to pass that I be-
gan to be old, and an hundred and

 

THE BOOK

The Nephites keep the law of Moses,
look forward to the coming of Christ,
and prosper in the land—Many proph-
ets labor to keep the people in the way
of truth. About 399-361 B.c.

OW behold, I, Jarom, write
a few words according to
the commandment of my
father, Enos, that our “genealogy

may be kept.
2 And as “these plates are small,

138

seventy and nine years had passed
away from the time that our father
Lehi “left Jerusalem.

26 And I saw that I “must soon
go down to my grave, having been
wrought upon by the power of God
that I must preach and prophesy
unto this people, and declare the
word according to the truth which
is in Christ. And I have declared it
in all my days, and have rejoiced
in it above that of the world.

27 And Isoon go to the place of my
“rest, which is with my Redeemer;
for I know that in him I shall "rest.
And I rejoice in the day when my
‘mortal shall put on ‘immortality,
and shall stand before him; then
shall I see his face with pleasure,
and he will say unto me: Come unto
me, ye blessed, there is a place pre-
pared for you in the “mansions of
my Father. Amen.

and as these things are ‘written
for the intent of the benefit of our
brethren the “Lamanites, wherefore,
it must needs be that I write a little;
but I shall not write the things of
my prophesying, nor of my revela-
tions, For what could I write more
than my fathers have written? For
have not they revealed the plan of
salvation? I say unto you, Yea; and
this sufficeth me.

should be done among this people,
because of the hardness of their
hearts, and the deafness of their ears,
and the blindness of their minds,
and the ‘stiffness of their necks;
nevertheless, God is exceedingly
merciful unto them, and has not as
yet "swept them off from the face
of the land.

4 And there are many among us
who have many “revelations, for
they are not all ’stiffnecked. And as
many as are not stiffnecked and
have faith, have ‘communion with
the Holy Spirit, which maketh mani-
fest unto the children of men, ac-
cording to their faith.

5 And now, behold, two hundred
years had passed away, and the
people of Nephi had waxed strong
in the land. They observed to “keep
the law of Moses and the ’sabbath
day holy unto the Lord. And they
‘profaned not; neither did they
“blaspheme. And the ‘laws of the
land were exceedingly strict.

6 And they were scattered upon
“much of the face of the land, and
the Lamanites also. And they were
exceedingly more "numerous than
were they of the Nephites; and they
loved ‘murder and would drink the
“blood of beasts.

7 And it came to pass that they
came many times against us, the
Nephites, to battle. But our “kings
and our "leaders were mighty men
in the faith of the Lord; and they
taught the people the ways of the
Lord; wherefore, we withstood the
Lamanites and swept them away out

 

JAROM 1:4-11

of ‘our lands, and began to fortify
our cities, or whatsoever place of
our inheritance.

8 And we multiplied exceedingly,
and spread upon the face of the
land, and became exceedingly rich
in “gold, and in silver, and in pre-
cious things, and in fine ">workman-
ship of wood, in buildings, and in
‘machinery, and also in iron and
copper, and brass and steel, making
all manner of tools of every kind
to till the ground, and “weapons of
war—yea, the sharp pointed arrow,
and the quiver, and the dart, and
the javelin, and all preparations
for war.

9 And thus being prepared to meet
the Lamanites, they did not prosper
against us. But the word of the Lord
was verified, which he spake unto
our fathers, saying that: “Inasmuch
as ye will keep my commandments
ye shall °prosper in the land.

10 And it came to pass that the
prophets of the Lord did threaten
the people of Nephi, according to
the word of God, that if they did
not keep the commandments, but
should fall into transgression, they
should be “destroyed from off the
face of the land.

11 Wherefore, the prophets, and
the priests, and the “teachers, did
labor diligently, exhorting with all
long-suffering the people to dili-
gence; teaching the ‘law of Moses,
and the intent for which it was
given; persuading them to “look
forward unto the Messiah, and be-
lieve in him to come “as though he

already was. And after this manner
did they teach them.

12 And it came to pass that by so
doing they kept them from being
destroyed upon the face of the land;
for they did prick their hearts with
the word, ‘continually stirring them
up unto repentance.

13 And it came to pass that two
hundred and thirty and eight years
had passed away—after the man-
ner of wars, and “contentions, and
dissensions, for the space of ’much
of the time.

14 And I, Jarom, do not write more,
for the plates are “small. But behold,
my brethren, ye can go to the "other
plates of Nephi; for behold, upon
them the records of our wars are
engraven, according to the writings
of the ‘kings, or those which they
caused to be written.

15 And I deliver these plates into
the hands of my son Omni, that
they may be kept according to the
“commandments of my fathers.

THE BOOK OF OMNI

Omni, Amaron, Chemish, Abinadom,
and Amaleki, each in turn, keep the
records—Mosiah discovers the people
of Zarahemla, who came from Jerusa-
lem in the days of Zedekiah—Mosiah is
made king over them—The descendants
of Mulek at Zarahemla had discovered
Coriantumr, the last of the Jaredites—
King Benjamin succeeds Mosiah—Men
should offer their souls as an offering
to Christ. About 323-130 B.c.

Omni, being commanded by

my father, Jarom, that I should
write somewhat upon “these plates,
to preserve our genealogy—

2 Wherefore, in my days, I would
that ye should know that I fought
much with the sword to preserve
my people, the Nephites, from fall-
ing into the hands of their enemies,
the Lamanites. But behold, I of my-
self 4am a wicked man, and I have
not kept the statutes and the com-
mandments of the Lord as I ought
to have done.

Berni. it came to pass that I,

 

3 And it came to pass that two
hundred and seventy and six years
had passed away, and we had many
seasons of peace; and we had
many “seasons of serious war and
bloodshed. Yea, and in fine, two hun-
dred and eighty and two years had
passed away, and I had kept these
plates according to the "command-
ments of my ‘fathers; and I ¢con-
ferred them upon my son Amaron.
And I make an end.

4 And now I, Amaron, write the
things whatsoever I write, which
are few, in the book of my father.

5 Behold, it came to pass that
three hundred and twenty years
had passed away, and the more
wicked part of the Nephites were
“destroyed.

6 For the Lord would not suffer,
after he had led them out of the
land of Jerusalem and kept and
preserved them from falling into
the hands of their enemies, yea,
he would not suffer that the words
should not be verified, which he

spake unto our fathers, saying that:
“Inasmuch as ye will not keep my
commandments ye shall not ’pros-
per in the land.

7 Wherefore, the Lord did visit
them in great judgment; never-
theless, he did spare the righteous
that they should not perish, but
did deliver them out of the hands
of their enemies.

8 And it came to pass that I did
deliver the plates unto my brother
Chemish.

9 Now IL, Chemish, write what few
things I write, in the same book with
my brother; for behold, I saw the
last which he wrote, that he wrote it
with his own hand; and he wrote
it in the day that he delivered them
unto me. And after this manner we
keep the “records, for it is accord-
ing to the commandments of our
fathers. And I make an end.

10 Behold, I, Abinadom, am the
son of Chemish, Behold, it came
to pass that I saw much war and
contention between my people, the
Nephites, and the Lamanites; and I,
with my own sword, have taken the
lives of many of the Lamanites in
the defence of my brethren.

11 And behold, the “record of this
people is engraven upon plates
which is had by the ’kings, accord-
ing to the generations; and I know
of no revelation save that which
has been written, neither prophecy;
wherefore, that which is sufficient
is written. And I make an end.

12 Behold, lam Amaleki, the son of
Abinadom. Behold, I will speak unto
you somewhat concerning *Mosiah,
who was made king over the "land
of Zarahemla; for behold, he being
‘warned of the Lord that he should

 

OMNI 1:7-17

“flee out of the ‘land of ‘Nephi, and
as many as would hearken unto the
voice of the Lord should also ¢de-
part out of the land with him, into
the wilderness—

13 And it came to pass that he did
according as the Lord had com-
manded him. And they departed
out of the land into the wilderness,
as many as would hearken unto the
voice of the Lord; and they were led
by many preachings and prophe-
syings. And they were admonished
continually by the word of God; and
they were led by the power of his
“arm, through the wilderness until
they came down into the land which
is called the "land of Zarahemla.

14 And they discovered a “peo-
ple, who were called the people of
Zarahemla. Now, there was great
rejoicing among the people of Zar-
ahemla; and also Zarahemla did re-
joice exceedingly, because the Lord
had sent the people of Mosiah with
the plates of brass which contained
the record of the Jews.

15 Behold, it came to pass that
Mosiah discovered that the people
of ¢Zarahemla came out from Jeru-
salem at the time that °Zedekiah,
king of Judah, was carried away
captive into Babylon.

16 And they “journeyed in the wil-
derness, and were brought by the
hand of the Lord across the great
waters, into the land where Mosiah
discovered them; and they had dwelt
there from that time forth.

17 And at the time that Mosiah
discovered them, they had become
exceedingly numerous. Neverthe-
less, they had had many wars and
serious contentions, and had fallen
by the sword from time to time; and

their “language had become cor-
rupted; and they had brought no
’records with them; and they de-
nied the being of their Creator; and
Mosiah, nor the people of Mosiah,
could understand them.

18 But it came to pass that Mosiah
caused that they should be taught
in his “language. And it came to
pass that after they were taught in
the language of Mosiah, Zarahemla
gave a genealogy of his fathers, ac-
cording to his memory; and they
are written, but °not in these plates.

19 And it came to pass that the
people of Zarahemla, and of Mosiah,
did “unite together; and "Mosiah was
appointed to be their king.

20 And it came to pass in the days
of Mosiah, there was a large “stone
brought unto him with engravings
on it; and he did °interpret the
engravings by the gift and power
of God.

21 And they gave an account of
one “Coriantumr, and the slain of
his people. And Coriantumr was
discovered by the people of Zara-
hemla; and he dwelt with them for
the space of nine moons.

22 It also spake a few words con-
cerning his fathers. And his first
parents came out from the “tower,
at the time the Lord *confounded
the language of the people; and the
severity of the Lord fell upon them
according to his judgments, which
are just; and their “bones lay scat-
tered in the land northward.

23 Behold, I, Amaleki, was born in
the days of Mosiah; and I have lived
to see his death; and “Benjamin, "his
son, reigneth in his stead.

 

142

24 And behold, I have seen, in the
days of king Benjamin, a serious war
and much bloodshed between the
Nephites and the Lamanites. But
behold, the Nephites did obtain
much advantage over them; yea,
insomuch that king Benjamin did
drive them out of the land of Zara-
hemla.

25 And it came to pass that I began
to be old; and, having no seed, and
knowing king “Benjamin to be a just
man before the Lord, wherefore, I
shall ’deliver up ‘these plates unto
him, exhorting all men to come
unto God, the Holy One of Israel,
and believe in prophesying, and in
revelations, and in the ministering
of angels, and in the gift of speak-
ing with tongues, and in the gift of
interpreting languages, and in all
things which are “good; for there is
nothing which is good save it comes
from the Lord: and that which is
evil cometh from the devil.

26 And now, my beloved brethren,
I would that ye should “come unto
Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel,
and partake of his salvation, and
the power of his redemption. Yea,
come unto him, and "offer your
whole souls as an “offering unto him,
and continue in “fasting and pray-
ing, and endure to the end; and as
the Lord liveth ye will be saved.

27 And now I would speak some-
what concerning a certain “number
who went up into the wilderness to
’return to the ‘land of Nephi; for
there was a large number who were
desirous to possess the land of their
inheritance.

ing a strong and mighty man, and
a stiffnecked man, wherefore he
caused a contention among them;
and they were “all slain, save fifty,
in the wilderness, and they returned
again to the land of Zarahemla.
29 And it came to pass that they
also took others to a considerable

number, and took their journey
again into the wilderness.

30 And I, Amaleki, had a brother,
who also went with them; and I
have not since known concerning
them. And I am about to lie down
in my grave; and “these plates are
full. And I make an end of my
speaking.

THE WORDS OF MORMON

Mormon abridges the large plates of
Nephi—He puts the small plates with
the other plates—King Benjamin es-
tablishes peace in the land. About
A.D. 385.

ND now I, Mormon, being about
to deliver up the “record which

I have been making into the
hands of my son Moroni, behold I
have witnessed almost all the de-
struction of my people, the Nephites.

2 And it is ¢many hundred years
after the coming of Christ that I de-
liver these records into the hands of
my son; and it supposeth me that he
will witness the entire "destruction
of my people. But may God grant
that he may survive them, that he
may write somewhat concerning
them, and somewhat concerning
Christ, that perhaps some day it
may ‘profit them.

3 And now, I speak somewhat con-
cerning that which I have written;
for after [had made an “abridgment
from the "plates of Nephi, down to

 

the reign of this king Benjamin, of
whom Amaleki spake, I searched
among the ‘records which had been
delivered into my hands, and I found
these plates, which contained this
small account of the prophets, from
Jacob down to the reign of this king
4Benjamin, and also many of the
words of Nephi.

4 And the things which are upon
these plates “pleasing me, because
of the prophecies of the coming of
Christ; and my fathers knowing that
many of them have been fulfilled;
yea, and I also know that as many
things as have been ’prophesied
concerning us down to this day
have been fulfilled, and as many
as go beyond this day must surely
come to pass—

5 Wherefore, I chose “these things,
to finish my "record upon them,
which remainder of my record I
shall take from the ‘plates of Nephi;
and I cannot write the “hundredth
part of the things of my people.

6 But behold, I shall take these

plates, which contain these prophe-
syings and revelations, and put them
with the remainder of my record,
for they are choice unto me; and I
know they will be choice unto my
brethren.

7 And Ido this for a “wise "purpose;
for thus it whispereth me, accord-
ing to the workings of the Spirit of
the Lord which is in me. And now,
I do not know all things; but the
Lord “‘knoweth all things which are
to come; wherefore, he “worketh
in me to do according to his ‘will.

8 And my “prayer to God is con-
cerning my brethren, that they may
once again come to the knowledge
of God, yea, the redemption of
Christ; that they may once again
be a *delightsome people.

9 And now I, Mormon, proceed to
finish out my record, which I take
from the plates of Nephi; and I make
it according to the knowledge and
the “understanding which God has
given me.

10 Wherefore, it came to pass that
after Amaleki had “delivered up
these plates into the hands of king
Benjamin, he took them and put
them with the other plates, which
contained records which had been
handed down by the ‘kings, from
generation to generation until the
days of king Benjamin.

11 And they were handed down
from king Benjamin, from genera-
tion to generation until they have
fallen into “my hands. And I, Mor-
mon, pray to God that they may
be preserved from this time hence-
forth. And I know that they will

 

144

be preserved; for there are great
things written upon them, out of
which ’my people and their breth-
ren shall be ‘judged at the great and
last day, according to the word of
God which is written.

12 And now, concerning this king
Benjamin—he had somewhat of
contentions among his own people.

13 And it came to pass also that
the armies of the Lamanites came
down out of the “land of Nephi, to
battle against his people. But be-
hold, king Benjamin gathered to-
gether his armies, and he did stand
against them; and he did fight with
the strength of his own arm, with the
’sword of Laban.

14 And in the “strength of the Lord
they did contend against their en-
emies, until they had slain many
thousands of the Lamanites. And
it came to pass that they did con-
tend against the Lamanites until
they had driven them out of all the
lands of their inheritance.

15 And it came to pass that after
there had been false *Christs, and
their mouths had been shut, and they
punished according to their crimes;

16 And after there had been “false
prophets, and false preachers and
teachers among the people, and all
these having been punished accord-
ing to their crimes; and after there
having been much contention and
many dissensions away "unto the
Lamanites, behold, it came to pass
that king Benjamin, with the as-
sistance of the holy ‘prophets who
were among his people—

a “holy man, and he did reign over
his people in righteousness; and
there were many holy men in the
land, and they did speak the word of
God with °power and with authority;
and they did use much ‘sharpness
because of the stiffneckedness of
the people—

18 Wherefore, with the help of
these, king “Benjamin, by laboring
with all the might of his body and
the ’faculty of his whole soul, and
also the prophets, did once more
establish peace in the land.

THE BOOK OF MOSIAH

CHAPTER 1

King Benjamin teaches his sons the lan-
guage and prophecies of their fathers—
Their religion and civilization have been
preserved because of the records kept on
the various plates—Mosiah is chosen as
king and is given custody of the records
and other things. About 130-124 B.c.

ND now there was no more
contention in all the “land of
Zarahemla, among all the
people who belonged to king Ben-
jamin, so that king Benjamin had
continual peace all the remainder of
his days.

2 And it came to pass that he had
three “sons; and he called their
names Mosiah, and Helorum, and
Helaman. And he caused that they
should be *taught in all the ‘lan-
guage of his fathers, that thereby
they might become men of under-
standing; and that they might know
concerning the prophecies which
had been spoken by the mouths of
their fathers, which were delivered
them by the hand of the Lord.

 

3 And he also taught them con-
cerning the records which were
engraven on the “plates of brass, say-
ing: My sons, I would that ye should
remember that were it not for these
’plates, which contain these records
and these commandments, we must
have suffered in “ignorance, even at
this present time, not knowing the
mysteries of God.

4 For it were not possible that our
father, Lehi, could have remembered
all these things, to have taught them
to his children, except it were for the
help of these plates; for he having
been taught in the “language of the
Egyptians therefore he could read
these engravings, and teach them to
his children, that thereby they could
teach them to their children, and
so fulfilling the commandments of
God, even down to this present time.

51 say unto you, my sons, “were
it not for these things, which have
been kept and "preserved by the
hand of God, that we might ‘read and
understand of his “mysteries, and
have his ‘commandments always

before our eyes, that even our
fathers would have dwindled in
unbelief, and we should have been
like unto our brethren, the Laman-
ites, who know nothing concerning
these things, or even do not believe
them when they are taught them,
because of the ‘traditions of their
fathers, which are not correct.

6 Omy sons, I would that ye should
remember that these sayings are
true, and also that these records
are “true. And behold, also the plates
of Nephi, which contain the records
and the sayings of our fathers from
the time they left Jerusalem until
now, and they are true; and we can
know of their surety because we
have them before our eyes.

7 And now, my sons, I would that
ye should remember to “search
them diligently, that ye may profit
thereby; and I would that ye should
’keep the commandments of God,
that ye may ‘prosper in the land
according to the “promises which
the Lord made unto our fathers.

8 And many more things did king
Benjamin teach his sons, which are
not written in this book.

9 And it came to pass that after
king Benjamin had made an end
of teaching his sons, that he waxed
“old, and he saw that he must very
soon go the way of all the earth;
therefore, he thought it expedient
that he should confer the kingdom
upon one of his sons.

10 Therefore, he had Mosiah
brought before him; and these are
the words which he spake unto
him, saying: My son, I would that
ye should make a proclamation
throughout all this land among all

 

146

this “people, or the people of Zara-
hemla, and the people of Mosiah
who dwell in the land, that thereby
they may be gathered together; for
on the morrow I shall proclaim unto
this my people out of mine own
mouth that thou art a "king and a
ruler over this people, whom the
Lord our God hath given us.

11 And moreover, I shall give this
people a “name, that thereby they
may be distinguished above all the
people which the Lord God hath
brought out of the land of Jerusa-
lem; and this I do because they have
been a ’diligent people in keeping
the commandments of the Lord.

12 And I give unto them a name
that never shall be blotted out, ex-
cept it be through “transgression.

13 Yea, and moreover I say unto
you, that if this highly favored
people of the Lord should fall into
“transgression, and become a wicked
and an adulterous people, that the
Lord will deliver them up, that
thereby they become 'weak like
unto their brethren; and he will no
more ‘preserve them by his match-
less and marvelous power, as he
has hitherto preserved our fathers.

14 For I say unto you, that if he
had not extended his arm in the
preservation of our fathers they
must have fallen into the hands of
the Lamanites, and become victims
to their hatred.

15 And it came to pass that after
king Benjamin had made an end
of these sayings to his son, that he
gave him “charge concerning all
the affairs of the kingdom.

16 And moreover, he also gave him
charge concerning the records which

were engraven on the “plates of
brass; and also the plates of Nephi;
and also, the "sword of Laban, and
the ‘ball or director, which led our
fathers through the wilderness,
which was prepared by the hand of
the Lord that thereby they might
be led, every one according to the
heed and diligence which they gave
unto him.

17 Therefore, as they were “unfaith-
ful they did not prosper nor progress
in their journey, but were ’driven
back, and incurred the displeasure
of God upon them; and therefore
they were smitten with famine and
sore ‘afflictions, to stir them up in
4remembrance of their duty.

18 And now, it came to pass that
Mosiah went and did as his father
had commanded him, and pro-
claimed unto all the people who
were in the land of Zarahemla that
thereby they might gather them-
selves together, to go up to the
“temple to hear the words which
his father should speak unto them.

CHAPTER 2

King Benjamin addresses his people—He
recounts the equity, fairness, and spiri-
tuality of his reign—He counsels them to
serve their Heavenly King—Those who
rebel against God will suffer anguish
like unquenchable fire. About 124 B.c.

AND it came to pass that after Mo-
siah had done as his father had
commanded him, and had made
a proclamation throughout all the
land, that the people “gathered
themselves together throughout
all the land, that they might go up

 

MOSIAH 1:17-2:6

to the *temple to “hear the ¢words
which king Benjamin should speak
unto them.

2 And there were a great number,
even so many that they did not
number them; for they had multi-
plied exceedingly and waxed great
in the land.

3 And they also took of the “first-
lings of their flocks, that they might
offer ’sacrifice and “burnt “offerings
“according to the law of Moses;

4 And also that they might give
thanks to the Lord their God, who
had brought them out of the land
of Jerusalem, and who had deliv-
ered them out of the hands of their
enemies, and had “appointed just
men to be their *teachers, and also
a just man to be their king, who
had established peace in the ‘land
of Zarahemla, and who had taught
them to ‘keep the commandments
of God, that they might rejoice and
be filled with ‘love towards God
and all men.

5 And it came to pass that when
they came up to the temple, they
pitched their tents round about,
every man according to his “family,
consisting of his wife, and his
sons, and his daughters, and their
sons, and their daughters, from
the eldest down to the youngest,
every family being separate one
from another.

6 And they pitched their tents
round about the temple, every man
having his “tent with the door there-
of towards the temple, that thereby
they might remain in their tents
and hear the words which king
Benjamin should speak unto them;

7 For the multitude being so great
that king Benjamin could not teach
them all within the walls of the
temple, therefore he caused a “tower
to be erected, that thereby his peo-
ple might hear the words which he
should speak unto them.

8 And it came to pass that he be-
gan to speak to his people from the
tower; and they could not all hear
his words because of the greatness
of the multitude; therefore he caused
that the words which he spake
should be written and sent forth
among those that were not under the
sound of his voice, that they might
also receive his words.

9 And these are the words which
he ¢spake and caused to be written,
saying: My brethren, all ye that have
assembled yourselves together, you
that can hear my words which I
shall speak unto you this day; for I
have not commanded you to come
up hither to "trifle with the words
which I shall speak, but that you
should ‘hearken unto me, and open
your ears that ye may hear, and your
“hearts that ye may understand, and
your ‘minds that the ‘mysteries of
God may be unfolded to your view.

10 I have not commanded you to
come up hither that ye should fear
4me, or that ye should think that Il of
myself am more than a mortal man.

11 But I am like as yourselves,
subject to all manner of infirmities
in body and mind; yet I have been
chosen by this people, and “conse-
crated by ’my father, and was suf-
fered by the hand of the Lord that
I should be a ruler and a king over
this people; and have been kept and
preserved by his matchless power, to

 

148

serve you with all the might, mind
and strength which the Lord hath
granted unto me.

12 1 say unto you that as I have
been suffered to “spend my days in
your service, even up to this time,
and have not sought ’gold nor silver
nor any manner of riches of you;

13 Neither have I suffered that ye
should be confined in dungeons,
nor that ye should make slaves one
of another, nor that ye should mur-
der, or plunder, or steal, or commit
adultery; nor even have I suffered
that ye should commit any manner
of wickedness, and have taught you
that ye should keep the command-
ments of the Lord, in all things
which he hath commanded you—

14 And even I, myself, have 4la-
bored with mine own "hands that I
might serve you, and that ye should
not be ‘laden with taxes, and that
there should nothing come upon you
which was grievous to be borne—
and of all these things which I have
spoken, ye yourselves are witnesses
this day.

15 Yet, my brethren, I have not
done these things that I might
*boast, neither do I tell these things
that thereby I might accuse you;
but I tell you these things that ye
may Know that I can answer a clear
’conscience before God this day.

16 Behold, I say unto you that
because I said unto you that I had
spent my days in your service, I do
not desire to boast, for I have only
been in the service of God.

17 And behold, I tell you these
things that ye may learn “wisdom;
that ye may learn that when ye are
in the ’service of your ‘fellow beings

ye are only in the service of your
God.

18 Behold, ye have called me your
king; and if 1, whom ye call your king,
do labor to “serve you, then ought
not ye to labor to serve one another?

19 And behold also, if 1, whom
ye call your king, who has spent
his days in your service, and yet
has been in the service of God, do
merit any thanks from you, O how
you ought to “thank your heavenly
’King!

20 Isay unto you, my brethren, that
if you should render all the “thanks
and ’praise which your whole soul
has power to possess, to that God
who has created you, and has kept
and ‘preserved you, and has caused
that ye should “rejoice, and has
granted that ye should live in peace
one with another—

21 Isay unto you that if ye should
“serve him who has created you
from the beginning, and is °pre-
serving you from day to day, by
lending you ‘breath, that ye may
live and move and do according to
your own *will, and even supporting
you from one moment to another—I
say, if ye should serve him with all
your ‘whole souls yet ye would be
funprofitable servants.

22 And behold, all that he 4re-
quires of you is to "keep his com-
mandments; and he has ‘promised
you that if ye would keep his com-
mandments ye should prosper in the
land; and he never doth “vary from
that which he hath said; therefore,

 

MOSIAH 2:18-28

if ye do ‘keep his ‘commandments
he doth bless you and prosper you.

23 And now, in the first place, he
hath created you, and granted unto
you your lives, for which ye are in-
debted unto him.

24 And secondly, he doth “require
that ye should do as he hath com-
manded you; for which if ye do, he
doth immediately "bless you; and
therefore he hath paid you. And
ye are still indebted unto him, and
are, and will be, forever and ever;
therefore, of what have ye to boast?

25 And now Lask, can ye say aught
of yourselves? I answer you, Nay.
Ye cannot say that ye are even as
much as the dust of the earth; yet
ye were “created of the dust of the
earth; but behold, it ‘belongeth to
him who created you.

26 And I, even I, whom ye call
your king, am “no better than ye
yourselves are; for | am also of the
dust. And ye behold that I am old,
and am about to yield up this mor-
tal frame to its mother earth.

27 Therefore, as I said unto you that I
had 4served you, "walking with aclear
conscience before God, even so I at
this time have caused that ye should
assemble yourselves together, that I
might be found blameless, and that
your ‘blood should not come upon
me, when I shall stand to be judged
of God of the things whereof he hath
commanded me concerning you.

“rid my garments of your blood,
at this period of time when I am
about to go down to my grave, that
I might go down in peace, and my
immortal ’spirit may join the ‘choirs
above in singing the praises of a
just God.

29 And moreover, I say unto you
that I have caused that ye should
assemble yourselves together, that
I might declare unto you that I
can no longer be your teacher, nor
your king;

30 For even at this time, my whole
frame doth tremble exceedingly
while attempting to speak unto
you; but the Lord God doth sup-
port me, and hath suffered me that
I should speak unto you, and hath
commanded me that I should de-
clare unto you this day, that my
son Mosiah is a “king and a ruler
over you.

31 And now, my brethren, I would
that ye should do as ye have hitherto
done. As ye have kept my command-
ments, and also the commandments
of my father, and have prospered,
and have been kept from falling into
the hands of your enemies, even so
if ye shall keep the commandments
of my son, or the commandments of
God which shall be delivered unto
you by him, ye shall prosper in the
land, and your enemies shall have
no power over you.

32 But, O my people, beware lest
there shall arise “contentions among
you, and ye °list to ‘obey the evil
spirit, which was spoken of by my
father Mosiah.

33 For behold, there is a wo pro-
nounced upon him who listeth to

 

150

“obey that spirit; for if he listeth
to obey him, and remaineth and
dieth in his ’sins, the same drin-
keth ‘damnation to his own soul;
for he receiveth for his wages an
“everlasting ‘punishment, having
transgressed the law of God con-
trary to his own knowledge.

34 Isay unto you, that there are not
any among you, except it be your
little children that have not been
taught concerning these things, but
what knoweth that ye are eternally
“indebted to your heavenly Father,
to render to him ’all that you have
and are; and also have been taught
concerning the ‘records which con-
tain the prophecies which have been
spoken by the holy prophets, even
down to the time our father, Lehi,
left Jerusalem;

35 And also, all that has been
spoken by our fathers until now.
And behold, also, they spake that
which was commanded them of
the Lord; therefore, they are “just
and true.

36 And now, I say unto you, my
brethren, that after ye have known
and have been taught all these
things, if ye should transgress and
go “contrary to that which has been
spoken, that ye do withdraw your-
selves from the Spirit of the Lord,
that it may have no place in you to
guide you in wisdom’s paths that
ye may be blessed, prospered, and
preserved—

37 Isay unto you, that the man that
doeth this, the same cometh out in
open “rebellion against God; there-
fore he *listeth to obey the evil
spirit, and becometh an enemy to

all righteousness; therefore, the Lord
has no place in him, for he dwelleth
not in ‘unholy temples.

38 Therefore if that man ?re-
penteth not, and remaineth and di-
eth an enemy to God, the demands
of divine justice do awaken his
immortal soul to a lively sense of
his own ‘guilt, which doth cause
him to shrink from the “presence
of the Lord, and doth fill his breast
with guilt, and “pain, and ‘anguish,
which is like an unquenchable “fire,
whose flame ascendeth up forever
and ever.

39 And now I say unto you, that
4mercy hath no claim on that man;
therefore his final doom is to endure
a never-ending *torment.

40 O, all ye ¢old men, and also ye
young men, and you little children
who can understand my words, for
Ihave spoken plainly unto you that
ye might understand, I pray that ye
should awake to a "remembrance
of the awful situation of those that
have fallen into transgression.

41 And moreover, I would desire
that ye should consider on the
blessed and “happy state of those
that keep the commandments of
God. For behold, they are "blessed
in all things, both temporal and
spiritual; and if they hold out ‘faith-
ful to the end they are received
into “heaven, that thereby they
may dwell with God in a state of
never-ending happiness. O remem-
ber, remember that these things
are true; for the Lord God hath
spoken it.

 

MOSIAH 2:38-3:5

CHAPTER 3

King Benjamin continues his address—
The Lord Omnipotent will minister
among men in a tabernacle of clay—
Blood will come from every pore as He
atones for the sins of the world—His
is the only name whereby salvation
comes—Men can put off the natural
man and become Saints through the
Atonement—The torment of the wicked
will be as a lake of fire and brimstone.
About 124 B.c.

AND again my brethren, I would call
your attention, for I have somewhat
more to speak unto you; for behold,
Ihave things to tell you concerning
that which is to come.

2 And the things which I shall tell
you are made known unto me by
an “angel from God. And he said
unto me: "Awake; and I awoke, and
behold he stood before me.

3 And he said unto me: Awake,
and hear the words which I shall
tell thee; for behold, I am come to
declare unto you the “glad tidings
of great °joy.

4 For the Lord hath heard thy
prayers, and hath judged of thy
“righteousness, and hath sent me to
declare unto thee that thou may-
est rejoice; and that thou mayest
declare unto thy people, that they
may also be filled with joy.

5 For behold, the time cometh,
and is not far distant, that with
power, the “Lord "Omnipotent who
‘reigneth, who was, and is from
all “eternity to all eternity, shall
come down from heaven among the

children of men, and shall dwell in
a ‘tabernacle of clay, and shall go
forth amongst men, working mighty
fmiracles, such as healing the sick,
raising the dead, causing the lame
to walk, the “blind to receive their
sight, and the deaf to hear, and cur-
ing all manner of diseases.

6 And he shall cast out “devils, or
the "evil spirits which dwell in the
hearts of the children of men.

7 And lo, he shall “suffer *temp-
tations, and pain of body, “hunger,
thirst, and fatigue, even more than
man can ‘suffer, except it be unto
death; for behold, ‘blood cometh
from every pore, so great shall be
his ‘anguish for the wickedness and
the abominations of his people.

8 And he shall be called “Jesus
’Christ, the “Son of God, the “Father
of heaven and earth, the ‘Creator of
all things from the beginning; and
his ‘mother shall be called Mary.

9 And lo, he cometh unto his own,
that ¢salvation might come unto
the children of men even through
‘faith on his name; and even after
all this they shall consider him a
man, and say that he hath a ‘devil,

 

152

and shall ‘scourge him, and shall
‘crucify him.

10 And he shall ¢rise the °third
day from the dead; and behold, he
standeth to ‘judge the world; and
behold, all these things are done
that a righteous judgment might
come upon the children of men.

11 For behold, and also his “blood
batoneth for the sins of those who
have ‘fallen by the transgression of
Adam, who have died not knowing
the ‘will of God concerning them,
or who have “ignorantly sinned.

12 But wo, wo unto him who
knoweth that he “rebelleth against
God! For salvation cometh to none
such except it be through repen-
tance and faith on the "Lord Jesus
Christ.

13 And the Lord God hath sent his
holy “prophets among all the chil-
dren of men, to declare these things
to every kindred, nation, and tongue,
that thereby whosoever should be-
lieve that Christ should come, the
same might receive "remission of
their sins, and rejoice with exceed-

14 Yet the Lord God saw that his
people were a “stiffnecked people,
and he appointed unto them a "law,
even the ‘law of Moses.

15 And many signs, and wonders,
and “types, and shadows showed he
unto them, concerning his coming;
and also holy prophets spake unto
them concerning his coming; and
yet they "hardened their hearts,
and understood not that the ‘law
of Moses availeth nothing “except
it were through the ‘atonement of
his blood.

16 And even if it were possible
that little “children could sin they
could not be saved; but I say unto
you they are °blessed; for behold,
as in Adam, or by nature, they fall,
even so the blood of Christ ‘atoneth
for their sins.

17 And moreover, I say unto you,
that there shall be “no other name
given nor any other way nor means
whereby ’salvation can come unto
the children of men, only in and
through the name of Christ, the
‘Lord Omnipotent.

18 For behold he judgeth, and
his judgment is just; and the in-
fant perisheth not that dieth in
his infancy; but men drink *dam-
nation to their own souls except
they humble themselves and °be-

 

MOSIAH 3:14-22

come as little children, and be-
lieve that ‘salvation was, and is,
and is to come, in and through the
4atoning blood of Christ, the Lord
Omnipotent.

19 For the “natural ’man is an
‘enemy to God, and has been from
the “fall of Adam, and will be, for-
ever and ever, unless he “yields to
the enticings of the ‘Holy Spirit,
and ¢putteth off the "natural man
and becometh a ‘saint through the
atonement of Christ the Lord, and
becometh as a ‘child, ‘submissive,
meek, humble, patient, full of love,
willing to submit to all things which
the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon
him, even as a child doth submit
to his father.

20 And moreover, I say unto you,
that the time shall come when the
“knowledge of a ’Savior shall spread
throughout ‘every nation, kindred,
tongue, and people.

21 And behold, when that time
cometh, none shall be found “blame-
less before God, except it be little
children, only through repentance
and faith on the name of the Lord
God Omnipotent.

22 And even at this time, when
thou shalt have taught thy people
the things which the Lord thy God
hath commanded thee, even then

are they found no more blameless
in the sight of God, only according
to the words which I have spoken
unto thee.

23 And now I have spoken the
words which the Lord God hath
commanded me.

24 And thus saith the Lord: They
shall stand as a bright testimony
against this people, at the judgment
day; whereof they shall be judged,
every man according to his “works,
whether they be good, or whether
they be evil.

25 And if they be evil they are
consigned to an awful “view of their
own guilt and abominations, which
doth cause them to shrink from the
presence of the Lord into a state of
’misery and ‘endless torment, from
whence they can no more return;
therefore they have drunk damna-
tion to their own souls.

26 Therefore, they have drunk out
of the “cup of the wrath of God,
which justice could no more deny
unto them than it could deny that
’Adam should fall because of his
partaking of the forbidden ‘fruit;
therefore, “mercy could have claim
on them no more forever.

27 And their “torment is as a “lake
of fire and brimstone, whose flames
are unquenchable, and whose smoke
ascendeth up ‘forever and ever.
Thus hath the Lord commanded
me. Amen.

CHAPTER 4

King Benjamin continues his address—
Salvation comes because of the Atonement
—Believe in God to be saved—Retain

 

154

a remission of your sins through faith-
fulness—Impart of your substance to
the poor—Do all things in wisdom and
order. About 124 B.c.

AND now, it came to pass that when
king Benjamin had made an end
of speaking the words which had
been delivered unto him by the
“angel of the Lord, that he cast his
eyes round about on the multitude,
and behold they had fallen to the
earth, for the ‘fear of the Lord had
come upon them.

2 And they had “viewed themselves
in their own °carnal state, even ‘less
than the dust of the earth. And they
all cried aloud with one voice, say-
ing: O have mercy, and apply the
4atoning blood of Christ that we may
receive forgiveness of our sins, and
our hearts may be “purified; for we
believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of
God, who ‘created heaven and earth,
and all things; who shall come down
among the children of men.

3 And it came to pass that af-
ter they had spoken these words
the Spirit of the Lord came upon
them, and they were filled with
joy, having received a “remission
of their sins, and having peace of
’conscience, because of the exceed-
ing ‘faith which they had in Jesus
Christ who should come, according
to the words which king Benjamin
had spoken unto them.

4 And king Benjamin again opened
his mouth and began to speak
unto them, saying: My friends and
my brethren, my kindred and my
people, I would again call your
attention, that ye may hear and

understand the remainder of my
words which I shall speak unto you.

5 For behold, if the knowledge of
the goodness of God at this time has
awakened you to a sense of your
“nothingness, and your worthless
and fallen state—

61 say unto you, if ye have come
to a “knowledge of the goodness of
God, and his matchless power, and
his wisdom, and his patience, and his
long-suffering towards the children
of men; and also, the "atonement
which has been prepared from the
‘foundation of the world, that thereby
salvation might come to him that
should put his “trust in the Lord,
and should be diligent in keeping his
commandments, and continue in the
faith even unto the end of his life, I
mean the life of the mortal body—

71 say, that this is the man who
receiveth salvation, through the
atonement which was prepared
from the foundation of the world for
all mankind, which ever were since
the “fall of Adam, or who are, or who
ever shall be, even unto the end of
the world.

8 And this is the means whereby
salvation cometh, And there is “none
other salvation save this which hath
been spoken of; neither are there
any conditions whereby man can be
saved except the conditions which
I have told you.

9 Believe in “God; believe that he
is, and that he created all things,
both in heaven and in earth; believe
that he has all ‘wisdom, and all
power, both in heaven and in earth;

 

MOSIAH 4:5-13

believe that man doth not “compre-
hend all the things which the Lord
can comprehend.

10 And again, believe that ye must
“repent of your sins and forsake
them, and humble yourselves be-
fore God; and ask in "sincerity of
heart that he would ‘forgive you;
and now, if you “believe all these
things see that ye ‘do them.

11 And again I say unto you as I
have said before, that as ye have
come to the knowledge of the glory
of God, or if ye have known of his
goodness and have “tasted of his
love, and have received a ’remis-
sion of your sins, which causeth
such exceedingly great joy in your
souls, even so I would that ye should
remember, and always retain in re-
membrance, the greatness of God,
and your own ‘nothingness, and
his “goodness and long-suffering
towards you, unworthy creatures,
and humble yourselves even in the
depths of ‘humility, ‘calling on the
name of the Lord daily, and stand-
ing ‘steadfastly in the faith of that
which is to come, which was spoken
by the mouth of the angel.

12 And behold, I say unto you that
if ye do this ye shall always rejoice,
and be filled with the “love of God,
and always ’retain a remission of
your sins; and ye shall grow in the
‘knowledge of the glory of him that
created you, or in the knowledge of
that which is just and true.

13 And ye will not have a ¢*mind
to injure one another, but to live
’peaceably, and to render to every

man according to that which is
his due.

14 And ye will not suffer your
“children that they go hungry, or
naked; neither will ye °suffer that
they transgress the laws of God, and
fight and ‘quarrel one with another,
and serve the devil, who is the mas-
ter of sin, or who is the “evil spirit
which hath been spoken of by our
fathers, he being an enemy to all
righteousness.

15 But ye will “teach them to ’walk
in the ways of truth and ‘soberness;
ye will teach them to “love one an-
other, and to serve one another.

16 And also, ye yourselves will
succor those that stand in need of
your succor; ye will administer
of your substance unto him that
standeth in need; and ye will not
suffer that the "beggar putteth up
his petition to you in vain, and turn
him out to perish.

17 Perhaps thou shalt “say: The
man has brought upon himself his
misery; therefore I will stay my
hand, and will not give unto him
of my food, nor impart unto him of
my substance that he may not suf-
fer, for his punishments are just—

18 But I say unto you, O man,
whosoever doeth this the same hath
great cause to repent; and except
he repenteth of that which he hath
done he perisheth forever, and hath
no interest in the kingdom of God.

19 For behold, are we not all *beg-
gars? Do we not all depend upon
the same Being, even God, for all
the substance which we have, for
both food and raiment, and for gold,

 

156

and for silver, and for all the riches
which we have of every kind?

20 And behold, even at this time,
ye have been calling on his name,
and begging for a “remission of your
sins. And has he suffered that ye
have begged in vain? Nay; he has
poured out his °Spirit upon you, and
has caused that your hearts should
be filled with ‘joy, and has caused
that your mouths should be stopped
that ye could not find utterance,
so exceedingly great was your joy.

21 And now, if God, who has cre-
ated you, on whom you are depen-
dent for your lives and for all that
ye have and are, doth grant unto
you whatsoever ye ask that is right,
in faith, believing that ye shall re-
ceive, O then, how ye ought to “im-
part of the substance that ye have
one to another.

22 And if ye “judge the man who
putteth up his petition to you for
your substance that he perish not,
and condemn him, how much more
just will be your ’condemnation for
withholding your substance, which
doth not belong to you but to God,
to whom also your life ‘belongeth;
and yet ye put up no petition, nor
repent of the thing which thou
hast done.

23 Isay unto you, wo be unto that
man, for his substance shall perish
with him; and now, I say these things
unto those who are “rich as per-
taining to the things of this world.

24 And again, I say unto the poor,
ye who have not and yet have suf-
ficient, that ye remain from day
to day; I mean all you who deny

the beggar, because ye have not; I
would that ye say in your hearts
that: I “give not because I "have not,
but if I had I would ‘give.

25 And now, if ye say this in your
hearts ye remain guiltless, other-
wise ye are “condemned; and your
condemnation is just for ye covet
that which ye have not received.

26 And now, for the sake of these
things which I have spoken unto
you—that is, for the sake of retain-
ing a remission of your sins from
day to day, that ye may “walk guilt-
less before God—I would that ye
should "impart of your substance
to the “poor, every man accord-
ing to that which he hath, such as
“feeding the hungry, clothing the
naked, visiting the sick and admin-
istering to their relief, both spiri-
tually and temporally, according to
their wants.

27 And see that all these things are
done in wisdom and “order; for it
is not requisite that a man should
run faster than he has strength.
And again, it is expedient that he
should be diligent, that thereby he
might win the prize; therefore, all
things must be done in order.

28 And 1 would that ye should
remember, that whosoever among
you “borroweth of his neighbor
should return the thing that he
borroweth, according as he doth
agree, or else thou shalt commit
sin; and perhaps thou shalt cause
thy neighbor to commit sin also.

29 And finally, | cannot tell you all
the things whereby ye may commit
sin; for there are divers ways and
means, even so many that I cannot
number them.

 

MOSIAH 4:25-5:4

30 But this much I can tell you, that
if ye do not “watch yourselves, and
your *thoughts, and your ‘words,
and your deeds, and observe the com-
mandments of God, and “continue
in the faith of what ye have heard
concerning the coming of our Lord,
even unto the end of your lives,
ye must perish. And now, O man,
remember, and perish not.

CHAPTER 5

The Saints become the sons and daugh-
ters of Christ through faith—They are
then called by the name of Christ—King
Benjamin exhorts them to be steadfast
and immovable in good works. About
124 B.c.

AND now, it came to pass that when
king Benjamin had thus spoken to
his people, he sent among them,
desiring to know of his people if
they “believed the words which he
had spoken unto them.

2 And they all cried with one voice,
saying: Yea, we believe all the words
which thou hast spoken unto us;
and also, we know of their surety
and truth, because of the Spirit of
the Lord Omnipotent, which has
wrought a mighty “change in us,
or in our hearts, that we have no
more disposition to do "evil, but to
do good continually.

3 And we, ourselves, also, through
the infinite “goodness of God, and
the manifestations of his Spirit,
have great views of that which is
to come; and were it expedient, we
could prophesy of all things.

4 And it is the faith which we have
had on the things which our king
has spoken unto us that has brought

us to this great knowledge, whereby
we do rejoice with such exceedingly
great joy.

5 And we are willing to enter into
a “covenant with our God to do his
will, and to be obedient to his com-
mandments in all things that he
shall command us, all the remainder
of our days, that we may not bring
upon ourselves a ’never-ending
torment, as has been spoken by the
‘angel, that we may not drink out
of the cup of the wrath of God.

6 And now, these are the words
which king Benjamin desired of
them; and therefore he said unto
them: Ye have spoken the words
that I desired; and the covenant
which ye have made is a righteous
covenant.

7 And now, because of the cov-
enant which ye have made ye shall
be called the “children of Christ,
his sons, and his daughters; for be-
hold, this day he hath spiritually
begotten you; for ye say that your
hearts are "changed through faith
on his name; therefore, ye are “born
of him and have become his “sons
and his daughters.

8 And under this head ye are made
“free, and there is "no other head
whereby ye can be made free. There
is no other ‘name given whereby
salvation cometh; therefore, I would
that ye should “take upon you the
name of Christ, all you that have
entered into the covenant with God
that ye should be obedient unto the
end of your lives.

9 And it shall come to pass that
whosoever doeth this shall be found
at the right hand of God, for he

 

158

shall know the name by which he
is called; for he shall be called by
the name of Christ.

10 And now it shall come to pass,
that whosoever shall not take upon
him the name of Christ must be
called by some “other name; there-
fore, he findeth himself on the "left
hand of God.

11 And I would that ye should re-
member also, that this is the “name
that I said I should give unto you
that never should be blotted out,
except it be through transgression;
therefore, take heed that ye do not
transgress, that the name be not
blotted out of your hearts.

12 1 say unto you, I would that
ye should remember to “retain the

that ye are not found on the left
hand of God, but that ye hear and
know the voice by which ye shall
be called, and also, the name by
which he shall call you.

13 For how “knoweth a man the
master whom he has not served,
and who is a stranger unto him,
and is far from the thoughts and
intents of his heart?

14 And again, doth a man take an
ass which belongeth to his neigh-
bor, and keep him? I say unto you,
Nay; he will not even suffer that he
shall feed among his flocks, but will
drive him away, and cast him out.
I say unto you, that even so shall it
be among you if ye know not the
name by which ye are called.

15 Therefore, I would that ye should
be steadfast and immovable, always
abounding in “good works, that

CHAPTER 6

King Benjamin records the names of
the people and appoints priests to teach
them—Mosiah reigns as a righteous
king. About 124-121 B.c.

AND now, king Benjamin thought
it was expedient, after having fin-
ished speaking to the people, that
he should “take the names of all
those who had entered into a cov-
enant with God to keep his com-
mandments.

2 And it came to pass that there
was not one soul, except it were little
children, but who had entered into
the covenant and had taken upon
them the name of Christ.

3 And again, it came to pass that
when king Benjamin had made an
end of all these things, and had
consecrated his son *Mosiah to be
a ruler and a king over his people,
and had given him all the charges
concerning the kingdom, and also
had ’appointed ‘priests to “teach
the people, that thereby they might
hear and know the commandments
of God, and to stir them up in re-
membrance of the ‘oath which they
had made, he dismissed the multi-
tude, and they returned, every one,
according to their ‘families, to their
own houses.

4 And Mosiah began to reign in
his father’s stead. And he began to
reign in the thirtieth year of his
age, making in the whole, about
four hundred and seventy-six

 

MOSIAH 6:1-7:2

years from the “time that Lehi left
Jerusalem.

5 And king Benjamin lived three
years and he died.

6 And it came to pass that king
Mosiah did “walk in the ways of the
Lord, and did observe his judgments
and his statutes, and did keep his
commandments in all things what-
soever he commanded him.

7 And king Mosiah did cause his
people that they should till the
earth, And he also, himself, did till
the earth, that thereby he might “not
become burdensome to his people,
that he might do according to that
which his father had done in all
things. And there was no conten-
tion among all his people for the
space of three years.

CHAPTER 7

Ammon finds the land of Lehi-Nephi,
where Limhi is king—Limhi’s people are
in bondage to the Lamanites—Limhi
recounts their history—aA prophet (Abin-
adi) had testified that Christ is the God
and Father of all things—Those who
sow filthiness reap the whirlwind, and
those who put their trust in the Lord
will be delivered. About 121 B.c.

AND now, it came to pass that af-
ter king Mosiah had had continual
peace for the space of three years,
he was desirous to know concerning
the people who ¢went up to dwell
in the land of "Lehi-Nephi, or in
the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his peo-
ple had heard nothing from them
from the time they left the land of
-Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied
him with their teasings.

2 And it came to pass that king
Mosiah granted that sixteen of their
strong men might go up to the land
of Lehi-Nephi, to inquire concern-
ing their brethren.

3 And it came to pass that on the
morrow they started to go up, hav-
ing with them one “Ammon, he be-
ing a strong and mighty man, and
a ’descendant of Zarahemla; and
he was also their leader.

4 And now, they knew not the
course they should travel in the
wilderness to go up to the land of
Lehi-Nephi; therefore they wan-
dered many days in the wilderness,
even “forty days did they wander.

5 And when they had wandered
forty days they came to a “hill, which
is north of the land of "Shilom, and
there they pitched their tents.

6 And “Ammon took three of his
brethren, and their names were
Amaleki, Helem, and Hem, and
they went down into the land of
’Nephi.

7 And behold, they met the king of
the people who were in the land of
Nephi, and in the land of *Shilom;
and they were surrounded by the
king’s guard, and were *taken, and
were ‘bound, and were committed
to “prison.

8 And it came to pass when they
had been in prison two days they
were again brought before the king,
and their bands were loosed; and
they stood before the king, and were
permitted, or rather “commanded,
that they should answer the ques-
tions which he should ask them.

9 And he said unto them: Behold,
lam *Limhi, the son of Noah, who
was the son of Zeniff, who came
up out of the "land of Zarahemla
to inherit this land, which was
the land of their fathers, who was
made a ‘king by the “voice of the
people.

 

160

10 And now, ¢I desire to know the
cause whereby ye were so bold as
to come near the walls of the city,
when I, myself, was with my guards
without the ’gate?

11 And now, for this cause have
I suffered that ye should be pre-
served, that I might inquire of you,
or else I should have caused that
my guards should have put you to
death. Ye are permitted to speak.

12 And now, when Ammon saw
that he was permitted to speak,
he went forth and “bowed himself
before the king; and rising again
he said: O king, lam very thankful
before God this day that | am yet
alive, and am permitted to speak;
and I will endeavor to speak with
boldness;

13 For lam assured that if ye had
known me ye would not have suf-
fered that I should have worn these
bands. For I am Ammon, and am
a “descendant of Zarahemla, and
have come up out of the land of
Zarahemla to inquire concerning
our brethren, whom ‘Zeniff brought
up out of that land.

14 And now, it came to pass that
after Limhi had heard the words of
Ammon, he was exceedingly “glad,
and said: Now, I know of a surety
that my brethren who were in the
land of Zarahemla are "yet alive.
And now, I will rejoice; and on the
morrow I will cause that my people
shall rejoice also.

15 For behold, we are in bondage
to the Lamanites, and are “taxed
with a tax which is grievous to
be borne. And now, behold, our
brethren will deliver us out of our
>bondage, or out of the hands of the

Lamanites, and we will be their
‘slaves; for it is better that we be
slaves to the Nephites than to pay
tribute to the king of the Lamanites.

16 And now, king Limhi command-
ed his guards that they should no
more bind Ammon nor his brethren,
but caused that they should go to
the hill which was north of Shilom,
and bring their brethren into the
city, that thereby they might eat,
and drink, and rest themselves from
the labors of their journey; for they
had suffered many things; they had
suffered hunger, thirst, and fatigue.

17 And now, it came to pass on
the morrow that king Limhi senta
proclamation among all his people,
that thereby they might gather
themselves together to the “temple,
to hear the words which he should
speak unto them.

18 And it came to pass that when
they had gathered themselves to-
gether that he “spake unto them in
this wise, saying: O ye, my people,
lift up your heads and be comforted;
for behold, the time is at hand, or
is not far distant, when we shall no
longer be in subjection to our en-
emies, notwithstanding our many
strugglings, which have been in
vain; yet I trust there ’remaineth
an effectual struggle to be made.

19 Therefore, lift up your heads,
and rejoice, and put your “trust in
’God, in that God who was the God
of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob;
and also, that God who ‘brought the
children of “Israel out of the land
of Egypt, and caused that they
should walk through the ‘Red Sea
on dry ground, and fed them with
fmanna that they might not perish
in the wilderness; and many more
things did he do for them.

 

MOSIAH 7:16-25

20 And again, that same God has
brought our fathers “out of the land
of Jerusalem, and has kept and pre-
served his people even until now;
and behold, it is "because of our in-
iquities and abominations that he
has brought us into bondage.

21 And ye all are witnesses this
day, that Zeniff, who was made king
over this people, he being “over-
zealous to inherit the land of his
fathers, therefore being deceived by
the cunning and craftiness of king
Laman, who having entered into a
treaty with king Zeniff, and having
yielded up into his hands the posses-
sions of a part of the land, or even
the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the
city of Shilom; and the land round
about—

22 And all this he did, for the sole
purpose of “bringing this people into
subjection or into bondage. And be-
hold, we at this time do pay *tribute
to the king of the Lamanites, to the
amount of one half of our corn, and
our barley, and even all our grain
of every kind, and one half of the
increase of our flocks and our herds;
and even one half of all we have or
possess the king of the Lamanites
doth exact of us, or our lives.

23 And now, is not this grievous
to be borne? And is not this, our
affliction, great? Now behold, how
great reason we have to “mourn.

24 Yea, lsay unto you, great are the
reasons which we have to “mourn;
for behold how many of our breth-
ren have been slain, and their blood
has been spilt in vain, and all be-
cause of iniquity.

25 For if this people had not fallen
into transgression the Lord would
not have suffered that this great evil
should come upon them. But behold,

they would not hearken unto his
words; but there arose contentions
among them, even so much that they
did shed blood among themselves.

26 And a“prophet of the Lord have
they "slain; yea, a chosen man of God,
who told them of their wickedness
and abominations, and prophesied
of many things which are to come,
yea, even the coming of Christ.

27 And because he said unto them
that Christ was the ¢God, the Father
of all things, and said that he should
take upon him the *image of man,
and it should be the ‘image after
which man was created in the be-
ginning; or in other words, he said
that man was created after the im-
age of “God, and that God should
come down among the children of
men, and take upon him flesh and
blood, and go forth upon the face
of the earth—

28 And now, because he said this,
they did “put him to death; and
many more things did they do
which brought down the wrath of
God upon them. Therefore, who
wondereth that they are in bond-
age, and that they are smitten with
sore afflictions?

29 For behold, the Lord hath said:
I will not “succor my people in the
day of their transgression; but I
will hedge up their ways that they
prosper not; and their doings shall
be as a ’stumbling block before
them.

30 And again, he saith: If my people
shall sow “filthiness they shall ’reap
the ‘chaff thereof in the whirlwind;
and the effect thereof is poison.

31 And again he saith: If my

 

162

people shall sow filthiness they
shall reap the “east wind, which
bringeth immediate destruction.

32 And now, behold, the promise
of the Lord is fulfilled, and ye are
smitten and afflicted.

33 But if ye will “turn to the Lord
with full purpose of heart, and put
your trust in him, and serve him
with all *diligence of mind, if ye do
this, he will, according to his own
will and pleasure, deliver you out
of bondage.

CHAPTER 8

Ammon teaches the people of Limhi—
He learns of the twenty-four Jaredite
plates—Ancient records can be trans-
lated by seers—No gift is greater than
seership. About 121 B.c.

AND it came to pass that after king
Limhi had made an end of “speak-
ing to his people, for he spake many
things unto them and only a few of
them have I written in this book, he
told his people all the things con-
cerning their brethren who were
in the land of Zarahemla.

2 And he caused that Ammon
should stand up before the multi-
tude, and rehearse unto them all
that had happened unto their breth-
ren from the time that “Zeniff went
up out of the land even until the
time that he "himself came up out
of the land.

3 And he also rehearsed unto them
the last words which king Benjamin
had “taught them, and explained
them to the people of king Limhi,
so that they might understand all
the words which he spake.

4 And it came to pass that after he
had done all this, that king Limhi
dismissed the multitude, and caused
that they should return every one
unto his own house.

5 And it came to pass that he caused
that the “plates which contained the
’record of his people from the time
that they left the ‘land of Zara-
hemla, should be brought before
Ammon, that he might read them.

6 Now, as soon as Ammon had
read the record, the king inquired
of him to know if he could “inter-
pret languages, and Ammon told
him that he could not.

7 And the king said unto him:
Being grieved for the afflictions of
my people, I caused that “forty and
three of my people should take a
journey into the wilderness, that
thereby they might find the land
of Zarahemla, that we might appeal
unto our brethren to deliver us out
of bondage.

8 And they were lost in the wilder-
ness for the space of “many days,
yet they were diligent, and found
not the land of Zarahemla but re-
turned to this land, having traveled
inaland among many waters, hav-
ing discovered a land which was
covered with "bones of men, and of
beasts, and was also covered with
ruins of buildings of every kind,
having discovered a land which
had been peopled with a people
who were as numerous as the hosts
of Israel.

9 And for a testimony that the
things that they had said are true
they have brought “twenty-four
plates which are filled with en-
gravings, and they are of pure gold.

10 And behold, also, they have
brought “*breastplates, which are

 

MOSIAH 8:4-16

large, and they are of "brass and
of copper, and are perfectly sound.

11 And again, they have brought
swords, the hilts thereof have per-
ished, and the blades thereof were
cankered with rust; and there is no
one in the land that is able to inter-
pret the language or the engravings
that are on the plates. Therefore I
said unto thee: Canst thou translate?

12 And I say unto thee again:
Knowest thou of any one that can
translate? For I am desirous that
these records should be translated
into our language; for, perhaps,
they will give us a knowledge ofa
remnant of the people who have
been destroyed, from whence these
records came; or, perhaps, they will
give us a knowledge of this very
people who have been destroyed;
and I am desirous to know the cause
of their destruction.

13 Now Ammon said unto him: I
can assuredly tell thee, O king, ofa
man that can “translate the records;
for he has wherewith that he can
look, and translate all records that
are of ancient date; and it is a gift
from God. And the things are called
‘interpreters, and no man can look
in them except he be commanded,
lest he should look for that he ought
not and he should perish. And who-
soever is commanded to look in
them, the same is called ‘seer,

14 And behold, the king of the peo-
ple who are in the land of Zarahemla
is the man that is commanded to
do these things, and who has this
high gift from God.

15 And the king said that a “seer
is greater than a prophet.

16 And Ammon said that a seer is
a revelator and a prophet also; and
a gift which is greater can no man

have, except he should possess the
power of God, which no man can;
yet a man may have great power
given him from God.

17 But a seer can Know of things
which are past, and also of things
which are to come, and by them shall
all things be revealed, or, rather,
shall secret things be made mani-
fest, and hidden things shall come
to light, and things which are not
known shall be made known by
them, and also things shall be made
known by them which otherwise
could not be known.

18 Thus God has provided a means
that man, through faith, might
work mighty miracles; therefore
he becometh a great benefit to his
fellow beings.

19 And now, when Ammon had
made an end of speaking these words
the king rejoiced exceedingly, and
gave thanks to God, saying: Doubt-
less a “great mystery is contained
within these plates, and these inter-
preters were doubtless prepared for
the purpose of unfolding all such
mysteries to the children of men.

20 O how marvelous are the works
of the Lord, and how long doth he
suffer with his people; yea, and
how “blind and impenetrable are
the understandings of the children
of men; for they will not seek wis-
dom, neither do they desire that
’she should rule over them!

21 Yea, they are as a wild flock
which fleeth from the shepherd, and
scattereth, and are driven, and are
devoured by the beasts of the forest.

THE RECORD OF ZENIFF—An account
of his people, from the time they
left the land of Zarahemla until the
time that they were delivered out
of the hands of the Lamanites.

Comprising chapters 9 through 22.

 

164

CHAPTER 9

Zeniff leads a group from Zarahemla to
possess the land of Lehi-Nephi—The La-
manite king permits them to inherit the
land—There is war between the Lamanites
and Zeniff’s people. About 200-187 B.c.

2], *ZENIFF, having been taught in
all the language of the Nephites,
and having had a knowledge of the
land of ‘Nephi, or of the land of our
fathers’ first inheritance, and hav-
ing been sent as a spy among the
Lamanites that I might spy out their
forces, that our army might come
upon them and destroy them—but
when I saw that which was good
among them I was desirous that
they should not be destroyed.

2 Therefore, I contended with my
brethren in the wilderness, for I would
that our ruler should make a treaty
with them; but he being an austere
and a blood-thirsty man commanded
that I should be slain; but I was res-
cued by the shedding of much blood;
for father fought against father, and
brother against brother, until the
greater number of our army was de-
stroyed in the wilderness; and we re-
turned, those of us that were spared,
to the land of Zarahemla, to relate that
tale to their wives and their children.

3 And yet, I being “over-zealous
to inherit the land of our fathers,
collected as many as were desirous
to go up to possess the land, and
started again on our °journey into
the wilderness to go up to the land;
but we were smitten with famine
and sore afflictions; for we were
slow to remember the Lord our God.

4 Nevertheless, after many days’
wandering in the wilderness we
pitched our tents in the place where
our brethren were slain, which was
near to the land of our fathers.

5 And it came to pass that I went
again with four of my men into the

city, in unto the king, that I might
know of the disposition of the king,
and that I might know if I might
go in with my people and possess
the land in peace.

6 And I went in unto the king, and
he covenanted with me that I might
possess the “land of Lehi-Nephi, and
the land of Shilom.

7 And he also commanded that
his people should depart out of the
land, and land my people went into
the land that we might possess it.

8 And we began to build build-
ings, and to repair the walls of
the city, yea, even the walls of the
city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of
Shilom.

9 And we began to till the ground,
yea, even with all manner of “seeds,
with seeds of corn, and of wheat,
and of barley, and with neas, and
with sheum, and with seeds of all
manner of fruits; and we did be-
gin to multiply and prosper in the
land.

10 Now it was the cunning and
the craftiness of king “Laman, to
’bring my people into bondage,
that he yielded up the land that
we might possess it.

11 Therefore it came to pass, that
after we had dwelt in the land for
the space of twelve years that king
Laman began to grow uneasy, lest
by any means my people should
*wax strong in the land, and that
they could not overpower them and
bring them into bondage.

12 Now they were a “lazy and an
*idolatrous people; therefore they
were desirous to bring us into bond-
age, that they might glut themselves
with the labors of our hands; yea,
that they might feast themselves
upon the flocks of our fields.

13 Therefore it came to pass that
king Laman began to stir up his

 

MOSIAH 9:6-19

people that they should contend
with my people; therefore there be-
gan to be wars and contentions in
the land.

14 For, in the thirteenth year of
my reign in the land of Nephi,
away on the south of the land of
*Shilom, when my people were wa-
tering and ’feeding their flocks,
and tilling their lands, a numer-
ous host of Lamanites came upon
them and began to slay them, and
to take off their flocks, and the corn
of their fields.

15 Yea, and it came to pass that
they fled, all that were not over-
taken, even into the city of Nephi,
and did call upon me for protection.

16 And it came to pass that I did
arm them with bows, and with ar-
rows, with swords, and with cime-
ters, and with clubs, and with slings,
and with all manner of weapons
which we could invent, and I and
my people did go forth against the
Lamanites to battle.

17 Yea, in the “strength of the Lord
did we go forth to battle against
the Lamanites; for I and my peo-
ple did cry mightily to the Lord
that he would °deliver us out of the
hands of our enemies, for we were
awakened to a remembrance of the
deliverance of our fathers.

18 And God did “hear our cries
and did answer our prayers; and we
did go forth in his might; yea, we did
go forth against the Lamanites, and
in one day and a night we did slay
three thousand and forty-three; we
did slay them even until we had
driven them out of our land.

19 And I, myself, with mine own
hands, did help to bury their dead.
And behold, to our great sorrow
and lamentation, two hundred and
seventy-nine of our brethren were
slain.

CHAPTER 10

King Laman dies—His people are wild
and ferocious and believe in false tra-
ditions—Zeniff and his people prevail
against them. About 187-160 B.c.

AND it came to pass that we again
began to establish the kingdom and
we again began to possess the land
in peace. And I caused that there
should be “weapons of war made
of every kind, that thereby I might
have weapons for my people against
the time the Lamanites should come
up again to war against my people.

2 And I set guards round about
the land, that the Lamanites might
not come upon us again unawares
and destroy us; and thus I did guard
my people and my flocks, and keep
them from falling into the hands
of our enemies.

3 And it came to pass that we did
inherit the land of our fathers for
many years, yea, for the space of
twenty and two years.

4 And I did cause that the men
should till the ground, and raise all
manner of “grain and all manner
of fruit of every kind.

5 And I did cause that the women
should spin, and toil, and work, and
work all manner of fine linen, yea,
and “cloth of every kind, that we
might clothe our nakedness; and
thus we did prosper in the land—
thus we did have continual peace
in the land for the space of twenty
and two years.

6 And it came to pass that king
“Laman died, and his son began to
reign in his stead. And he began
to stir his people up in rebellion
against my people; therefore they
began to prepare for war, and to
come up to battle against my people.

7 But Lhad sent my spies out round
about the land of “Shemlon, that I

 

166

might discover their preparations,
that I might guard against them,
that they might not come upon my
people and destroy them.

8 And it came to pass that they
came up upon the north of the
land of Shilom, with their numer-
ous hosts, men “armed with ’bows,
and with arrows, and with swords,
and with cimeters, and with
stones, and with slings; and they had
their heads shaved that they were
naked; and they were girded witha
leathern girdle about their loins.

9 And it came to pass that I caused
that the women and children of my
people should be hid in the wilder-
ness; and I also caused that all my
old men that could bear arms, and
also all my young men that were
able to bear arms, should gather
themselves together to go to battle
against the Lamanites; and I did
place them in their ranks, every
man according to his age.

10 And it came to pass that we did
go up to battle against the Lamanites;
and I, even I, in my old age, did go
up to battle against the Lamanites.
And it came to pass that we did go up
in the “strength of the Lord to battle.

11 Now, the Lamanites knew noth-
ing concerning the Lord, nor the
strength of the Lord, therefore they
depended upon their own strength.
Yet they were a strong people, as
to the “strength of men.

12 They were a “wild, and fero-
cious, and a blood-thirsty people,
believing in the "tradition of their
fathers, which is this—Believing
that they were driven out of the land
of Jerusalem because of the iniqui-
ties of their fathers, and that they
were ‘wronged in the wilderness by
their brethren, and they were also
wronged while crossing the sea;

13 And again, that they were

wronged while in the land of their
“first inheritance, after they had
crossed the sea, and all this because
that Nephi was more faithful in
keeping the commandments of the
Lord—therefore "he was favored
of the Lord, for the Lord heard his
prayers and answered them, and
he took the lead of their journey
in the wilderness.

14 And his brethren were ¢wroth
with him because they "understood
not the dealings of the Lord; they
were also wroth with him upon the
waters because they hardened their
hearts against the Lord.

15 And again, they were “wroth
with him when they had arrived
in the promised land, because they
said that he had taken the ruling
of the people out of their hands;
and they sought to kill him.

16 And again, they were wroth
with him because he departed
into the wilderness as the Lord
had commanded him, and took the
*records which were engraven on
the plates of brass, for they said
that he *’robbed them.

17 And thus they have taught
their children that they should hate
them, and that they should mur-
der them, and that they should rob
and plunder them, and do all they
could to destroy them; therefore
they have an eternal hatred towards
the children of Nephi.

18 For this very cause has king
Laman, by his “cunning, and lying
craftiness, and his fair promises,
deceived me, that I have brought
this my people up into this land,
that they may destroy them; yea,
and we have suffered these many
years in the land.

19 And now |, Zeniff, after having
told all these things unto my people

 

MOSIAH 10:14-11:3

concerning the Lamanites, I did
stimulate them to go to battle with
their might, putting their trust in
the Lord; therefore, we did contend
with them, face to face.

20 And it came to pass that we did
drive them again out of our land;
and we slew them with a great
slaughter, even so many that we
did not number them.

21 And it came to pass that we
returned again to our own land,
and my people again began to
“tend their flocks, and to till their
ground.

22 And now I, being old, did confer
the kingdom upon one of my sons;
therefore, lsay no more. And may
the Lord “bless my people. Amen.

CHAPTER 11

King Noah rules in wickedness—He
revels in riotous living with his wives
and concubines—Abinadi prophesies
that the people will be taken into bond-
age—His life is sought by King Noah.
About 160-150 B.c.

AND now it came to pass that
Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon
Noah, one of his sons; therefore
Noah began to reign in his stead;
and he did not walk in the ways of
his father.

2 For behold, he did not keep the
commandments of God, but he did
walk after the desires of his own
heart. And he had many wives and
“concubines. And he did cause his
people to commit sin, and do that
which was ‘abominable in the sight
of the Lord. Yea, and they did com-
mit ?whoredoms and ‘all manner of
wickedness,

3 And he laid a “tax of one fifth
part of all they possessed, a fifth part
of their gold and of their silver,

and a fifth part of their °ziff, and
of their copper, and of their brass
and their iron; and a fifth part of
their fatlings; and also a fifth part
of all their grain.

4 And all this did he take to ¢sup-
port himself, and his wives and his
’concubines; and also his priests,
and their wives and their concu-
bines; thus he had changed the af-
fairs of the kingdom.

5 For he put down all the priests
that had been consecrated by his
father, and consecrated new “ones
in their stead, such as were lifted
up in the pride of their hearts.

6 Yea, and thus they were sup-
ported in their laziness, and in their
idolatry, and in their whoredoms,
by the taxes which king Noah had
put upon his people; thus did the
people labor exceedingly to sup-
port iniquity.

7 Yea, and they also became idola-
trous, because they were deceived
by the vain and flattering words of
the king and priests; for they did
speak flattering things unto them.

8 And it came to pass that king
Noah built many elegant and spa-
cious buildings; and he ornamented
them with fine work of wood, and
of all manner of “precious things, of
gold, and of silver, and of iron, and
of brass, and of ziff, and of copper;

9 And he also built him a spacious
palace, and a throne in the midst
thereof, all of which was of fine wood
and was ornamented with gold and
silver and with precious things.

10 And he also caused that his
workmen should work all manner
of fine work within the walls of
the “temple, of fine wood, and of
copper, and of brass.

11 And the seats which were set

 

168

apart for the “high priests, which
were above all the other seats, he
did ornament with pure gold; and
he caused a breastwork to be built
before them, that they might rest
their bodies and their arms upon
while they should speak lying and
vain words to his people.

12 And it came to pass that he
built a “tower near the temple; yea,
avery high tower, even so high that
he could stand upon the top thereof
and overlook the land of °Shilom,
and also the land of ‘“Shemlon, which
was possessed by the Lamanites;
and he could even look over all the
land round about.

13 And it came to pass that he
caused many buildings to be built
in the land Shilom; and he caused a
great tower to be built on the “hill
north of the land Shilom, which
had been a resort for the children
of Nephi at the time they °fled out
of the land; and thus he did do with
the riches which he obtained by the
taxation of his people.

14 And it came to pass that he
placed his heart upon his riches,
and he spent his time in “riotous
living with his wives and his con-
cubines; and so did also his priests
spend their time with harlots.

15 And it came to pass that he
planted vineyards round about in
the land; and he built wine-presses,
and made “wine in abundance; and
therefore he became a wine-bibber,
and also his people.

16 And it came to pass that the La-
manites began to come in upon his
people, upon small numbers, and to
slay them in their fields, and while
they were tending their flocks.

17 And king Noah sent guards
round about the land to keep them

off; but he did not send a sufficient
number, and the Lamanites came
upon them and killed them, and
drove many of their flocks out of
the land; thus the Lamanites began
to destroy them, and to exercise
their hatred upon them.

18 And it came to pass that king
Noah sent his armies against them,
and they were driven back, or they
drove them back for a time; there-
fore, they returned rejoicing in
their spoil.

19 And now, because of this great
victory they were lifted up in the
pride of their hearts; they did “boast
in their own strength, saying that
their fifty could stand against thou-
sands of the Lamanites; and thus
they did boast, and did delight
in blood, and the shedding of the
blood of their brethren, and this
because of the wickedness of their
king and priests.

20 And it came to pass that there
was a man among them whose name
was “Abinadi; and he went forth
among them, and began to proph-
esy, saying: Behold, thus saith the
Lord, and thus hath he commanded
me, saying, Go forth, and say unto
this people, thus saith the Lord—
Wo be unto this people, for I have
seen their abominations, and their
wickedness, and their whoredoms;
and except they repent I will visit
them in mine anger.

21 And except they repent and
turn to the Lord their God, behold,
I will deliver them into the hands
of their enemies; yea, and they shall
be brought into “bondage; and they
shall be afflicted by the hand of
their enemies.

22 And it shall come to pass that

 

MOSIAH 11:18-29

they shall ¢know that Iam the Lord
their God, and am a *jealous God,
visiting the iniquities of my people.

23 And it shall come to pass that
except this people repent and turn
unto the Lord their God, they shall
be brought into bondage; and none
shall ¢deliver them, except it be the
Lord the Almighty God.

24 Yea, and it shall come to pass
that when they shall ¢cry unto me
I will be slow to hear their cries;
yea, and I will suffer them that they
be smitten by their enemies.

25 And except they repent in “sack-
cloth and ashes, and cry mightily to
the Lord their God, I will not "hear
their prayers, neither will I deliver
them out of their afflictions; and
thus saith the Lord, and thus hath
he commanded me.

26 Now it came to pass that when
Abinadi had spoken these words
unto them they were wroth with
him, and sought to take away his
life; but the Lord “delivered him
out of their hands.

27 Now when king Noah had heard
of the words which Abinadi had
spoken unto the people, he was also
wroth; and he said: *Who is Abin-
adi, that land my people should be
judged of him, or ’who is the Lord,
that shall bring upon my people
such great affliction?

28 [command you to bring Abinadi
hither, that I may slay him, for he
has said these things that he might
‘stir up my people to anger one
with another, and to raise conten-
tions among my people; therefore
I will slay him.

29 Now the eyes of the people were
“blinded; therefore they "hardened
their hearts against the words of

Abinadi, and they sought from that
time forward to take him. And king
Noah hardened his heart against
the word of the Lord, and he did
not repent of his evil doings.

CHAPTER 12

Abinadi is imprisoned for prophesying
the destruction of the people and the
death of King Noah—The false priests
quote the scriptures and pretend to keep
the law of Moses—Abinadi begins to
teach them the Ten Commandments.
About 148 B.c.

AND it came to pass that after the
space of two years that Abinadi came
among them in disguise, that they
knew him not, and began to “*proph-
esy among them, saying: Thus has
the Lord commanded me, saying—
Abinadi, go and prophesy unto this
my people, for they have hardened
their hearts against my words; they
have repented not of their evil do-
ings; therefore, I will visit them in
my anger, yea, in my fierce anger
will I visit them in their iniquities
and abominations.

2 Yea, wo be unto this generation!
And the Lord said unto me: Stretch
forth thy hand and prophesy, saying:
Thus saith the Lord, it shall come to
pass that this generation, because
of their iniquities, shall be brought
into “bondage, and shall be smit-
ten on the "cheek; yea, and shall be
driven by men, and shall be slain;
and the vultures of the air, and the
dogs, yea, and the wild beasts, shall
devour their ‘flesh.

3 And it shall come to pass that the
“life of king Noah shall be valued
even as a garment ina hot "furnace;
for he shall know that Lam the Lord.

 

170

4 And it shall come to pass that
I will smite this my people with
sore afflictions, yea, with famine
and with “pestilence; and I will
cause that they shall "howl all the
day long.

5 Yea, and I will cause that they
shall have “burdens lashed upon
their backs; and they shall be driven
before like a dumb ass.

6 And it shall come to pass that I
will send forth “hail among them,
and it shall smite them; and they
shall also be smitten with the "east
wind; and ‘insects shall pester their
land also, and devour their grain.

7 And they shall be smitten witha
great pestilence—and all this willl
do because of their “iniquities and
abominations.

8 And it shall come to pass that
except they repent I will utterly “de-
stroy them from off the face of the
earth; yet they shall leave a ’record
behind them, and I will preserve
them for other nations which shall
possess the land; yea, even this will
I do that I may discover the abomi-
nations of this people to other na-
tions. And many things did Abinadi
prophesy against this people.

9 And it came to pass that they
were angry with him; and they took
him and carried him bound before
the king, and said unto the king:
Behold, we have brought a man be-
fore thee who has prophesied evil
concerning thy people, and saith
that God will destroy them.

10 And he also prophesieth evil
concerning thy “life, and saith that
thy life shall be as a garment ina
furnace of fire.

11 And again, he saith that thou
shalt be as a stalk, even as adry stalk

12 And again, he saith thou shalt
be as the blossoms of a thistle,
which, when it is fully ripe, if the
wind bloweth, it is driven forth
upon the face of the land. And he
pretendeth the Lord hath spoken
it. And he saith all this shall come
upon thee except thou repent, and
this because of thine iniquities.

13 And now, O king, what great
evil hast thou done, or what great
sins have thy people committed,
that we should be “condemned of
God or judged of this man?

14 And now, O king, behold, we
are “guiltless, and thou, O king, hast
not sinned; therefore, this man has
‘lied concerning you, and he has
prophesied in vain.

15 And behold, we are strong, we
shall not come into bondage, or be
taken captive by our enemies; yea,
and thou hast prospered in the
land, and thou shalt also prosper.

16 Behold, here is the man, we de-
liver him into thy hands; thou mayest
do with him as seemeth thee good.

17 And it came to pass that king
Noah caused that Abinadi should
be cast into prison; and he com-
manded that the “priests should
gather themselves together that
he might hold a council with them
what he should do with him.

18 And it came to pass that they
said unto the king: Bring him hither
that we may question him; and the
king commanded that he should be
brought before them.

19 And they began to question
him, that they might cross him, that
thereby they might have wherewith
to “accuse him; but he answered
them boldly, and withstood all their
questions, yea, to their astonish-

 

MOSIAH 12:12-29

ment; for he did *withstand them
in all their questions, and did
confound them in all their words.

20 And it came to pass that one of
them said unto him: “What meaneth
the words which are written, and
which have been taught by our
fathers, saying:

21 “How beautiful upon the moun-
tains are the feet of him °that
bringeth good tidings; that pub-
lisheth peace; that bringeth good
tidings of good; that publisheth
salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy
God reigneth;

22 *Thy watchmen shall lift up
the voice; with the voice together
shall they sing; for they shall see
eye to eye when the Lord shall bring
again Zion;

23 Break forth into joy; sing to-
gether ye waste places of Jerusalem;
for the Lord hath comforted his peo-
ple, he hath redeemed Jerusalem;

24 The Lord hath made bare his
holy “arm in the eyes of all the na-
tions, and all the ends of the earth
shall see the salvation of our God?

25 And now Abinadi said unto
them: Are you “priests, and pretend
to teach this people, and to under-
stand the spirit of prophesying, and
yet desire to know of me what these
things mean?

26 I say unto you, wo be unto you
for perverting the ways of the Lord!
For if ye understand these things
ye have not taught them; there-
fore, ye have perverted the ways
of the Lord.

27 Ye have not applied your “hearts
to ’understanding; therefore, ye
have not been wise. Therefore, what
teach ye this people?

28 And they said: We teach the
law of Moses.

29 And again he said unto them:

MOSIAH 12:30-13:7

If ye teach the “law of Moses why
do ye not keep it? Why do ye set
your hearts upon "riches? Why do
ye commit whoredoms and ‘spend
your strength with harlots, yea,
and cause this people to commit
sin, that the Lord has cause to send
me to prophesy against this people,
yea, even a great evil against this
people?

30 Know ye not that I speak the
“truth? Yea, ye know that I speak
the truth; and you ought to tremble
before God.

31 And it shall come to pass that
ye shall be smitten for your iniqui-
ties, for ye have said that ye teach
the law of Moses. And what know
ye concerning the law of Moses?
*Doth salvation come by the law
of Moses? What say ye?

32 And they answered and said
that salvation did come by the law
of Moses.

33 But now Abinadi said unto
them: I know if ye “keep the com-
mandments of God ye shall be
saved; yea, if ye keep the command-
ments which the Lord delivered
unto Moses in the mount of ’Sinai,
saying:

34 “1 am the Lord thy God, who
hath "brought thee out of the land of
Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

35 Thou shalt have no “other God
before me.

36 “Thou shalt not make unto thee
any graven image, or any likeness of
any thing in heaven above, or things
which are in the earth beneath.

37 Now Abinadi said unto them,
Have ye done all this? I say unto
you, Nay, ye have not. And have ye
“taught this people that they should
do all these things? I say unto you,
Nay, ye have not.

 

172

CHAPTER 13

Abinadi is protected by divine power—
He teaches the Ten Commandments—
Salvation does not come by the law of
Moses alone—God Himself will make
an atonement and redeem His people.
About 148 B.c.

AND now when the king had heard
these words, he said unto his priests:
Away with this fellow, and slay him;
for what have we to do with him, for
he is ¢mad.

2 And they stood forth and at-
tempted to lay their hands on him;
but he withstood them, and said
unto them:

3 Touch me not, for God shall
smite you if ye lay your hands
upon me, for I have not delivered
the message which the Lord sent
me to deliver; neither have I told
you that which ye requested that I
should tell; therefore, God will not
suffer that I shall be destroyed at
this time.

4 But I must fulfil the command-
ments wherewith God has com-
manded me; and because I have told
you the truth ye are angry with me.
And again, because I have spoken
the word of God ye have judged me
that lam mad.

5 Now it came to pass after Abin-
adi had spoken these words that the
people of king Noah durst not lay
their hands on him, for the Spirit
of the Lord was upon him; and his
face *shone with exceeding luster,
even as Moses’ did while in the
mount of Sinai, while speaking with
the Lord.

6 And he spake with “power and
authority from God; and he contin-
ued his words, saying:

7 Ye see that ye have not power to

slay me, therefore I finish my *mes-
sage. Yea, and I perceive that it
cuts you to your hearts because I
tell you the truth concerning your
iniquities.

8 Yea, and my words fill you with
wonder and amazement, and with
anger.

9 But I finish my message; and
then it “matters not whither I go,
if it so be that Iam saved.

10 But this much I tell you, what
you “do with me, after this, shall be
as a *type and a shadow of things
which are to come.

11 And now I read unto you the
remainder of the “commandments
of God, for I perceive that they are
not written in your hearts; I perceive
that ye have studied and taught *in-
iquity the most part of your lives.

12 And now, ye remember that
I ¢said unto you: Thou shalt not
make unto thee any graven image,
or any likeness of things which are
in heaven above, or which are in the
earth beneath, or which are in
the water under the earth.

13 And again: Thou shalt not *bow
down thyself unto them, nor serve
them; for I the Lord thy God ama
jealous God, visiting the iniquities
of the fathers upon the children,
unto the third and fourth genera-
tions of them that hate me;

14 And showing mercy unto thou-
sands of them that love me and keep
my commandments.

15 Thou shalt not take the name
of the Lord thy God in vain; for the
Lord will not hold him “guiltless
that taketh his name in vain.

16 Remember the “sabbath day, to
keep it holy.

 

MOSIAH 13:8-27

17 Six days shalt thou labor, and
do all thy work;

18 But the seventh day, the sab-
bath of the Lord thy God, thou
shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy
son, nor thy daughter, thy man-
servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor
thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is
within thy gates;

19 For in “six days the Lord made
heaven and earth, and the sea, and
all that in them is; wherefore the
Lord blessed the sabbath day, and
hallowed it.

20 “Honor thy "father and thy
mother, that thy days may be long
upon the land which the Lord thy
God giveth thee.

21 Thou shalt not “kill.

22 Thou shalt not commit ¢adul-
tery. Thou shalt not °steal.

23 Thou shalt not bear “false wit-
ness against thy neighbor.

24 Thou shalt not “covet thy neigh-
bor’s house, thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor’s wife, nor his man-
servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his
ox, nor his ass, nor anything that
is thy neighbor’s.

25 And it came to pass that after
Abinadi had made an end of these
sayings that he said unto them: Have
ye “taught this people that they
should observe to do all these things
for to keep these commandments?

261 say unto you, Nay; for if ye
had, the Lord would not have caused
me to come forth and to prophesy
evil concerning this people.

27 And now ye have said that sal-
vation cometh by the law of Moses.
I say unto you that it is expedient
that ye should “keep the law of
Moses as yet; but I say unto you,

that the time shall come when it
shall *no more be expedient to keep
the law of Moses.

28 And moreover, I say unto you,
that “salvation doth not come by
the ‘law alone; and were it not for
the ‘atonement, which God himself
shall make for the sins and iniqui-
ties of his people, that they must
unavoidably perish, notwithstand-
ing the law of Moses.

29 And now I say unto you that
it was expedient that there should
be a law given to the children of
Israel, yea, even a very “strict law;
for they were a stiffnecked people,
’quick to do iniquity, and slow to
remember the Lord their God;

30 Therefore there was a “law given
them, yea, a law of performances
and of "ordinances, a law which they
were to ‘observe strictly from day to
day, to keep them in remembrance
of God and their duty towards him.

31 But behold, I say unto you,
that all these things were “types of
things to come.

32 And now, did they “understand
the law? I say unto you, Nay, they
did not all understand the law;
and this because of the hardness
of their hearts; for they understood
not that there could not any man
be saved except it were through
the redemption of God.

33 For behold, did not Moses pro-
phesy unto them concerning the
coming of the Messiah, and that
God should redeem his people? Yea,
and even “all the prophets who have
prophesied ever since the world

 

174

began—have they not spoken more
or less concerning these things?

34 Have they not said that “God
himself should come down among
the children of men, and take upon
him the form of man, and go forth
in mighty power upon the face of
the earth?

35 Yea, and have they not said also
that he should bring to pass the
“resurrection of the dead, and that
he, himself, should be oppressed
and afflicted?

CHAPTER 14

Isaiah speaks messianically—The
Messiah’s humiliation and sufferings
dare set forth—He makes His soul an
offering for sin and makes intercession
for transgressors—Compare Isaiah 53.
About 148 B.c.

YEA, even doth not Isaiah say: Who
hath “believed our report, and to
whom is the arm of the Lord re-
vealed?

2 For he shall grow up before him
as a tender plant, and as a root out
of dry ground; he hath no form
nor comeliness; and when we shall
see him there is no beauty that we
should desire him.

3 He is “despised and rejected of
men; a man of sorrows, and ac-
quainted with grief; and we hid as
it were our faces from him; he was
despised, and we esteemed him not.

4 Surely he has “borne our "griefs,
and carried our sorrows; yet we did
esteem him stricken, smitten of God,
and afflicted.

5 But he was “wounded for our
*transgressions, he was bruised for
our iniquities; the chastisement of
our peace was upon him; and with
his stripes we are ‘healed.

6 All we, like “sheep, have gone
astray; we have turned every one
to his own way; and the Lord hath
laid on him the iniquities of us all.

7 He was oppressed, and he was
afflicted, yet he “opened not his
mouth; he is brought as a "lamb to
the slaughter, and as a sheep before
her shearers is dumb so he opened
not his mouth.

8 He was taken from prison and
from judgment; and who shall de-
clare his generation? For he was
cut off out of the land of the living;
for the transgressions of my people
was he stricken.

9 And he made his grave with the
wicked, and with the “rich in his
death; because he had done no "evil,
neither was any deceit in his mouth.

10 Yet it pleased the Lord to “bruise
him; he hath put him to grief; when
thou shalt make his soul an offer-
ing for sin he shall see his "seed,
he shall prolong his days, and the
pleasure of the Lord shall prosper
in his hand.

11 He shall see the travail of his
soul, and shall be satisfied; by
his knowledge shall my righteous

 

MOSIAH 14:5-15:3

servant justify many; for he shall
“bear their iniquities.

12 Therefore will I divide him a
portion with the “great, and "he shall
divide the spoil with the strong; be-
cause he hath poured out his soul
unto death; and he was numbered
with the transgressors; and he bore
the sins of many, and made ‘inter-
cession for the transgressors.

CHAPTER 15

How Christ is both the Father and the
Son—He will make intercession and
bear the transgressions of His people—
They and all the holy prophets are His
seed—He brings to pass the Resurrec-
tion—Little children have eternal life.
About 148 B.c.

AND now Abinadi said unto them:
I would that ye should understand
that “God himself shall ’come down
among the children of men, and
shall ‘redeem his people.

2 And because he “dwelleth in
’flesh he shall be called the ‘Son of
God, and having subjected the flesh
to the will of the ‘Father, being the
Father and the Son—

3 The Father, “because he was
’conceived by the power of God;
and the Son, because of the flesh;
thus becoming the Father and
Son—

4 And they are “one God, yea, the
very "Eternal ‘Father of heaven and
of earth.

5 And thus the flesh becoming
subject to the Spirit, or the Son to
the Father, being one God, “suffer-
eth temptation, and yieldeth not to
the temptation, but suffereth him-
self to be mocked, and "’scourged,
and cast out, and disowned by his
“people.

6 And after all this, after working
many mighty miracles among the
children of men, he shall be led,
yea, even “as Isaiah said, as a sheep
before the shearer is dumb, so he
’opened not his mouth.

7 Yea, even so he shall be led, ¢cru-
cified, and slain, the ’flesh becom-
ing subject even unto death, the
‘will of the Son being swallowed
up in the will of the Father.

8 And thus God breaketh the
*bands of death, having gained the
’victory over death; giving the Son
power to make ‘intercession for the
children of men—

9 Having ascended into heaven,
having the bowels of mercy; being
filled with compassion towards the
children of men; standing betwixt
them and justice; having broken
the bands of death, taken upon
*himself their iniquity and their
transgressions, having redeemed
them, and ’satisfied the demands of
justice.

 

176

10 And now I say unto you, who
shall declare his “generation? Be-
hold, Isay unto you, that when his
soul has been made an offering
for sin he shall see his ‘seed. And
now what say ye? And who shall
be his seed?

11 Behold I say unto you, that
whosoever has heard the words
of the “prophets, yea, all the holy
prophets who have prophesied con-
cerning the coming of the Lord—I
say unto you, that all those who have
hearkened unto their words, and be-
lieved that the Lord would redeem
his people, and have looked forward
to that day for a remission of their
sins, I say unto you, that these are
his seed, or they are the heirs of
the "kingdom of God.

12 For these are they whose sins
“he has borne; these are they for
whom he has died, to redeem them
from their transgressions. And now,
are they not his seed?

13 Yea, and are not the “proph-
ets, every one that has opened his
mouth to prophesy, that has not
fallen into transgression, I mean
all the holy prophets ever since the
world began? I say unto you that
they are his seed.

14 And these are “they who have
published peace, who have brought
good *tidings of good, who have
‘published salvation; and said unto
Zion: Thy God reigneth!

15 And O how beautiful upon the
mountains were their feet!

16 And again, how beautiful upon
the mountains are the feet of those
that are still publishing peace!

17 And again, how beautiful upon
the mountains are the feet of those
who shall hereafter publish peace,
yea, from this time henceforth and
forever!

18 And behold, I say unto you,
this is not all. For O how beautiful
upon the mountains are the “feet
of him that bringeth good tidings,
that is the founder of "peace, yea,
even the Lord, who has redeemed
his people; yea, him who has granted
salvation unto his people;

19 For were it not for the redemp-
tion which he hath made for his
people, which was prepared from
the “foundation of the world, I say
unto you, were it not for this, all
mankind must have ’perished.

20 But behold, the bands of
death shall be broken, and the
Son reigneth, and hath power over
the dead; therefore, he bringeth to
pass the resurrection of the dead.

21 And there cometh a resurrec-
tion, even a “first resurrection; yea,
even a resurrection of those that
have been, and who are, and who
shall be, even until the resurrection
of Christ—for so shall he be called.

22 And now, the resurrection of
all the prophets, and all those that
have believed in their words, or all
those that have kept the command-
ments of God, shall come forth in
the first resurrection; therefore, they
are the first resurrection.

23 They are raised to “dwell with

 

MOSIAH 15:15-29

God who has redeemed them; thus
they have eternal life through
Christ, who has °broken the bands
of death.

24 And these are those who have
part in the first resurrection; and
these are they that have died before
Christ came, in their ignorance, not
having “salvation declared unto
them. And thus the Lord bringeth
about the restoration of these; and
they have a part in the first resur-
rection, or have eternal life, being
redeemed by the Lord.

25 And little *children also have
eternal life.

26 But behold, and “fear, and
tremble before God, for ye ought
to tremble; for the Lord redeemeth
none such that rebel against him
and ‘die in their sins; yea, even all
those that have perished in their
sins ever since the world began,
that have wilfully rebelled against
God, that have known the command-
ments of God, and would not keep
them; “these are they that have ‘no
part in the first ‘resurrection.

27 Therefore ought ye not to trem-

CHAPTER 16

God redeems men from their lost and
fallen state—Those who are carnal
remain as though there were no re-
demption—Christ brings to pass a res-
urrection to endless life or to endless
damnation. About 148 B.c.

AND now, it came to pass that after
Abinadi had spoken these words he
stretched forth his hand and said:
The time shall come when all shall
see the “salvation of the Lord; when
bevery nation, kindred, tongue, and
people shall see eye to eye and shall
‘confess before God that his “judg-
ments are just.

2 And then shall the «wicked be
’cast out, and they shall have cause
to howl, and ‘weep, and wail, and
gnash their teeth; and this because
they would not “hearken unto the
voice of the Lord; therefore the Lord
redeemeth them not.

3 For they are “carnal and devilish,
and the devil has power over them;
yea, even that old serpent that did

 

178

>beguile our first parents, which was
the ‘cause of their fall; which
was the cause of 4all mankind be-
coming carnal, sensual, devilish,
*knowing evil from good, ‘subject-
ing themselves to the devil.

4 Thus all mankind were “lost;
and behold, they would have been
endlessly lost were it not that God
redeemed his people from their lost
and fallen state.

5 But remember that he that per-
sists in his own “carnal nature, and
goes on in the ways of sin and re-
bellion against God, remaineth in
his fallen state and the ’devil hath
all power over him. Therefore he
is as though there was no ‘redemp-
tion made, being an enemy to God;
and also is the “devil an enemy
to God.

6 And now if Christ had not come
into the world, speaking of things to
come “as though they had already
come, there could have been no
redemption.

7 And if Christ had not risen from
the dead, or have broken the bands
of death that the grave should have
no victory, and that death should
have no “sting, there could have
been no resurrection.

8 But there is a “resurrection, there-
fore the grave hath no victory, and
the sting of "death is swallowed
up in Christ.

9 He is the “light and the life of the
world; yea, a light that is endless,

that can never be darkened; yea,
and also a life which is endless,
that there can be no more death.

10 Even this mortal shall put on
“immortality, and this "corruption
shall put on incorruption, and shall
be brought to ‘stand before the bar
of God, to be judged of him accord-
ing to their works whether they be
good or whether they be evil—

11 1f they be good, to the resur-
rection of “endless life and "hap-
piness; and if they be evil, to the
resurrection of ‘endless damnation,
being delivered up to the devil,
who hath subjected them, which
is damnation—

12 Having gone according to their
own carnal wills and desires; hav-
ing never called upon the Lord
while the arms of mercy were ex-
tended towards them; for the arms
of mercy were extended towards
them, and they would “not; they
being warned of their iniquities
and yet they would not depart from
them; and they were commanded
to repent and yet they would
not repent.

13 And now, ought ye not to trem-
ble and repent of your sins, and re-
member that only in and through
Christ ye can be saved?

14 Therefore, if ye teach the “law
of Moses, also teach that it is a
’shadow of those things which are
to come—

15 Teach them that redemption
cometh through Christ the Lord, who
is the very “Eternal Father. Amen.

CHAPTER 17

Alma believes and writes the words
of Abinadi—Abinadi suffers death by

 

MOSIAH 16:10-17:8

fire—He prophesies disease and death by
fire upon his murderers. About 148 B.c.

AND now it came to pass that when
Abinadi had finished these sayings,
that the king commanded that the
“priests should take him and cause
that he should be put to *death.

2 But there was one among them
whose name was “Alma, he also be-
ing a descendant of Nephi. And he
was a young man, and he ’believed
the words which Abinadi had spo-
ken, for he knew concerning the
iniquity which Abinadi had tes-
tified against them; therefore he
began to plead with the king that
he would not be angry with Abin-
adi, but suffer that he might depart
in peace.

3 But the king was more wroth,
and caused that Alma should be cast
out from among them, and sent his
servants after him that they might
slay him.

4 But he fled from before them
and “hid himself that they found
him not. And he being concealed
for many days did write all the
words which Abinadi had spoken.

5 And it came to pass that the king
caused that his guards should sur-
round Abinadi and take him; and
they bound him and cast him into
prison.

6 And after three days, having coun-
seled with his “priests, he caused
that he should again be brought
before him.

7 And he said unto him: Abin-
adi, we have found an accusation
against thee, and thou art worthy
of death.

8 For thou hast said that *God
himself should come down among

the children of men; and now, for
this cause thou shalt be put to death
unless thou wilt recall all the words
which thou hast spoken evil con-
cerning me and my people.

9 Now Abinadi said unto him: I
say unto you, I will “not recall the
words which I have spoken unto
you concerning this people, for they
are true; and that ye may know of
their surety I have suffered myself
that I have fallen into your hands.

10 Yea, and I will “suffer even un-
til death, and I will not recall my
words, and they shall stand as a ’tes-
timony against you. And if ye slay
me ye will shed ‘innocent blood,
and this shall also stand as a testi-
mony against you at the last day.

11 And now king Noah was about
to release him, for he feared his
word; for he feared that the judg-
ments of God would come upon him.

12 But the “priests lifted up their
voices against him, and began to
accuse him, saying: He has reviled
the king. Therefore the king was
stirred up in ’anger against him,
and he delivered him up that he
might be slain.

13 And it came to pass that they
took him and bound him, and
*scourged his skin with faggots,
yea, even unto ’death.

14 And now when the flames be-
gan to scorch him, he cried unto
them, saying:

15 Behold, even as ye have done
unto me, so shall it come to pass
that thy “seed shall cause that
many shall suffer the pains that I
do suffer, even the pains of *death
by fire; and this because they be-
lieve in the salvation of the Lord
their God.

 

180

16 And it will come to pass that ye
shall be afflicted with all manner of
“diseases because of your iniquities.

17 Yea, and ye shall be smitten
on every hand, and shall be driven
and scattered to and fro, even as a
wild flock is driven by wild and
ferocious beasts.

18 And in that day ye shall be
*hunted, and ye shall be taken by
the hand of your enemies, and then
ye shall suffer, as I suffer, the pains
of "death by fire.

19 Thus God executeth “vengeance
upon those that destroy his people.
O God, ’receive my soul.

20 And now, when “Abinadi had
said these words, he fell, having
suffered death by fire; yea, having
been put to death because he would
not deny the commandments of
God, having sealed the truth of his
words by his ’death.

CHAPTER 18

Alma preaches in private—He sets forth
the covenant of baptism and baptizes
at the waters of Mormon—He orga-
nizes the Church of Christ and ordains
priests—They support themselves and
teach the people—Alma and his people
flee from King Noah into the wilder-
ness. About 147-145 B.C.

AND now, it came to pass that Alma,
who had fled from the servants of
king Noah, “repented of his sins and
iniquities, and went about privately
among the people, and began to
teach the words of Abinadi—

2 Yea, concerning that which was
to come, and also concerning the
resurrection of the dead, and the “re-
demption of the people, which was
to be brought to pass through the

power, and sufferings, and "death

ascension into heaven.

3 And as many as would hear his
word he did teach. And he taught
them privately, that it might not
come to the knowledge of the king.
And many did believe his words.

4 And it came to pass that as many
as did believe him did go forth to
a*place which was called Mormon,
having received its name from the
king, being in the °borders of the
land having been infested, by times
or at seasons, by wild beasts.

5 Now, there was in Mormon a
fountain of pure water, and Alma
resorted thither, there being near
the water a thicket of small trees,
where he did hide himself in the
daytime from the searches of the
king.

6 And it came to pass that as many
as believed him went thither to
hear his words.

7 And it came to pass after many
days there were a goodly number
gathered together at the place of
Mormon, to hear the words of Alma,
Yea, all were gathered together that
believed on his word, to hear him.
And he did “teach them, and did
preach unto them repentance, and
redemption, and faith on the Lord.

8 And it came to pass that he said
unto them: Behold, here are the wa-
ters of Mormon (for thus were they
called) and now, as ye are “desirous
to come into the "fold of God, and
to be called his people, and are will-
ing to bear one another’s burdens,
that they may be light;

9 Yea, and are “willing to mourn
with those that "mourn; yea, and

 

MOSIAH 18:3-14

comfort those that stand in need of
comfort, and to stand as “witnesses
of God at all times and in all things,
and in all places that ye may be in,
even until death, that ye may be re-
deemed of God, and be numbered
with those of the “first resurrection,
that ye may have eternal life—

10 Now I say unto you, if this be
the desire of your hearts, what have
you against being “baptized in the
’name of the Lord, as a witness be-
fore him that ye have entered into
a ‘covenant with him, that ye will
serve him and keep his command-
ments, that he may pour out his
Spirit more abundantly upon you?

11 And now when the people had
heard these words, they clapped
their hands for joy, and exclaimed:
This is the desire of our hearts.

12 And now it came to pass that
Alma took Helam, he being one of
the first, and went and stood forth
in the water, and cried, saying: O
Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy
servant, that he may do this work
with holiness of heart.

13 And when he had said these
words, the “Spirit of the Lord was
upon him, and he said: Helam, I
baptize thee, having "authority
from the Almighty God, as a tes-
timony that ye have entered into
a ‘covenant to serve him until you
are dead as to the mortal body; and
may the Spirit of the Lord be poured
out upon you; and may he grant
unto you eternal life, through the
redemption of Christ, whom he has
prepared from the “foundation of
the world.

14 And after Alma had said these
words, both Alma and Helam were

“buried in the water; and they arose
and came forth out of the water re-
joicing, being filled with the Spirit.

15 And again, Alma took another,
and went forth a second time into
the water, and baptized him ac-
cording to the first, only he did not
bury “himself again in the water.

16 And after this manner he did
baptize every one that went forth
to the place of Mormon; and they
were in number about two hundred
and four souls; yea, and they were
*baptized in the waters of Mormon,
and were filled with the grace
of God.

17 And they were called the church
of God, or the “church of Christ,
from that time forward. And it came
to pass that whosoever was baptized
by the power and authority of God
was added to his church.

18 And it came to pass that Alma,
having “authority from God, "or-
dained priests; even one priest to
every fifty of their number did he
ordain to preach unto them, and to
‘teach them concerning the things
pertaining to the kingdom of God.

19 And he commanded them that
“they should "teach nothing save
it were the things which he had
taught, and which had been spoken
by the mouth of the holy prophets.

20 Yea, even he commanded them
that they should “preach nothing
save it were repentance and faith
on the Lord, who had redeemed
his people.

21 And he commanded them that

 

182

there should be no “contention one
with another, but that they should
look forward with "one eye, having
one faith and one baptism, having
their hearts ‘knit together in unity
and in love one towards another.

22 And thus he commanded them
to preach. And thus they became
the “children of God.

23 And he commanded them that
they should observe the “sabbath
day, and keep it holy, and also ev-
ery day they should give thanks to
the Lord their God.

24 And he also commanded them
that the priests whom he had or-
dained “should "labor with their
own hands for their support.

25 And there was “one day in every
week that was set apart that they
should ’gather themselves together
to teach the people, and to worship
the Lord their God, and also, as of-
ten as it was in their power, to ‘as-
semble themselves together.

26 And the priests were not to de-
pend upon the people for their sup-
port; but for their labor they were
to receive the “grace of God, that
they might wax strong in the Spirit,
having the "knowledge of God, that
they might teach with power and
authority from God.

27 And again Alma commanded
that the people of the church should
impart of their substance, “every
one according to that which he
had; if he have more abundantly
he should impart more abundantly;
and of him that had but little, but

little should be required; and to
him that had not should be given.

28 And thus they should impart
of their *substance of their own
free will and good desires towards
God, and to those priests that stood
in need, yea, and to every needy,
naked soul.

29 And this he said unto them,
having been commanded of God;
and they did ¢walk uprightly before
God, imparting to one another both
temporally and spiritually accord-
ing to their needs and their wants.

30 And now it came to pass that all
this was done in Mormon, yea, by
the waters of Mormon, in the forest
that was near the waters of Mormon;
yea, the place of Mormon, the waters
of Mormon, the forest of Mormon,
how beautiful are they to the eyes
of them who there came to the
knowledge of their Redeemer; yea,
and how blessed are they, for they
shall ’sing to his praise forever.

31 And these things were done in
the “borders of the land, that they
might not come to the knowledge
of the king.

32 But behold, it came to pass that
the king, having discovered a move-
ment among the people, sent his
servants to watch them. Therefore
on the day that they were assem-
bling themselves together to hear
the word of the Lord they were dis-
covered unto the king.

33 And now the king said that
Alma was stirring up the people
to rebellion against him; therefore
he sent his “army to destroy them.

34 And it came to pass that Alma
and the people of the Lord were “ap-
prised of the coming of the king’s
army; therefore they took their tents
and their families and *departed
into the wilderness.

35 And they were in number about

CHAPTER 19

Gideon seeks to slay King Noah—The
Lamanites invade the land—King Noah
suffers death by fire—Limhi rules as a
tributary monarch. About 145-121 B.c.

AND it came to pass that the ¢army of
the king returned, having searched
in vain for the people of the Lord.

2 And now behold, the forces of
the king were small, having been
reduced, and there began to be a
division among the remainder of
the people.

3 And the lesser part began to
“breathe out threatenings against
the king, and there began to be a
great contention among them.

4 And now there was a man among
them whose name was Gideon, and
he being a strong man and an en-
emy to the king, therefore he drew
his sword, and swore in his wrath
that he would slay the king.

5 And it came to pass that he
fought with the king; and when the
king saw that he was about to over-
power him, he fled and ran and got
upon the “tower which was near the
temple.

6 And Gideon pursued after him
and was about to get upon the tower
to slay the king, and the king cast
his eyes round about towards the
land of *Shemlon, and behold, the
army of the Lamanites were within
the borders of the land.

7 And now the king cried out in the
anguish of his soul, saying: Gideon,
“spare me, for the Lamanites are
upon us, and they will destroy us;
yea, they will destroy my people.

8 And now the king was not so
much concerned about his people as

he was about his “own life; never-
theless, Gideon did spare his life.

9 And the king commanded the
people that they should flee be-
fore the Lamanites, and he himself
did go before them, and they did
flee into the wilderness, with their
women and their children.

10 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites did pursue them, and
did overtake them, and began to
slay them.

11 Now it came to pass that the
king commanded them that all the
men should “leave their wives and
their children, and flee before the
Lamanites.

12 Now there were many that
would not leave them, but had
rather stay and perish with them.
And the rest left their wives and
their children and fled.

13 And it came to pass that those
who tarried with their wives and
their children caused that their fair
daughters should stand forth and
plead with the Lamanites that they
would not slay them.

14 And it came to pass that the La-
manites had compassion on them,
for they were charmed with the
beauty of their women.

15 Therefore the Lamanites did
spare their lives, and took them
captives and carried them back
to the land of Nephi, and granted
unto them that they might possess
the land, under the conditions that
they would deliver up king Noah
into the hands of the Lamanites, and
deliver up their property, even “one
half of all they possessed, one half
of their gold, and their silver, and
all their precious things, and thus
they should pay tribute to the king
of the Lamanites from year to year.

16 And now there was one of the
sons of the king among those that
were taken captive, whose name
was “Limhi.

 

184

17 And now Limhi was desirous
that his father should not be de-
stroyed; nevertheless, Limhi was
not ignorant of the iniquities of his
father, he himself being a just man.

18 And it came to pass that Gideon
sent men into the wilderness se-
cretly, to search for the king and
those that were with him. And it
came to pass that they met the peo-
ple in the wilderness, all save the
king and his priests.

19 Now they had sworn in their
hearts that they would return to the
land of Nephi, and if their “wives
and their children were slain, and
also those that had tarried with
them, that they would seek revenge,
and also perish with them.

20 And the king commanded them
that they should not return; and
they were angry with the king, and
caused that he should suffer, even
unto “death by fire.

21 And they were about to take
the priests also and “put them to
death, and they fled before them.

22 And it came to pass that they
were about to return to the land
of Nephi, and they met the men
of Gideon. And the men of Gideon
told them of all that had happened
to their wives and their children;
and that the Lamanites had granted
unto them that they might possess
the land by paying a tribute to the
Lamanites of one half of all they
possessed.

23 And the people told the men
of “Gideon that they had slain the
king, and his 'priests had fled from
them farther into the wilderness.

24 And it came to pass that after
they had ended the ceremony, that
they returned to the land of Nephi,
rejoicing, because their wives and
their children were not slain; and
they told Gideon what they had
done to the king.

25 And it came to pass that the

king of the Lamanites made an
“oath unto them, that his people
should not slay them.

26 And also Limhi, being the son
of the king, having the kingdom
conferred upon him “by the people,
made oath unto the king of the La-
manites that his people should pay
‘tribute unto him, even one half of
all they possessed.

27 And it came to pass that Limhi
began to establish the kingdom and
to establish “peace among his people.

28 And the king of the Lamanites
set “guards round about the land,
that he might ’keep the people of
Limhi in the land, that they might
not depart into the wilderness; and
he did support his guards out of the
tribute which he did receive from
the Nephites.

29 And now king Limhi did have
continual peace in his kingdom
for the space of two years, that the
Lamanites did not molest them nor
seek to destroy them.

CHAPTER 20

Some Lamanite daughters are abducted
by the priests of Noah—The Lamanites
wage war upon Limhi and his people—
The Lamanite hosts are repulsed and
pacified. About 145-123 B.c.

Now there was a place in “Shemlon
where the daughters of the Laman-
ites did gather themselves together
to sing, and to "dance, and to make
themselves merry.

2 And it came to pass that there
was one day a small number of
them gathered together to sing and
to dance.

3 And now the priests of king Noah,
being ashamed to return to the city
of Nephi, yea, and also fearing that
the people would “slay them, there-
fore they durst not return to their
wives and their ’children.

 

MOSIAH 19:26-20:12

4 And having tarried in the wil-
derness, and having discovered the
daughters of the Lamanites, they
laid and watched them;

5 And when there were but few of
them gathered together to dance,
they came forth out of their secret
places and took them and carried
them into the wilderness; yea,
twenty and four of the “daughters
of the Lamanites they carried into
the wilderness.

6 And it came to pass that when the
Lamanites found that their daugh-
ters had been missing, they were
angry with the people of Limhi,
for they thought it was the people
of Limhi.

7 Therefore they sent their armies
forth; yea, even the king himself
went before his people; and they
went up to the land of Nephi to
destroy the people of Limhi.

8 And now Limhi had discov-
ered them from the “tower, even
all their preparations for war did
he discover; therefore he gathered
his people together, and laid wait
for them in the fields and in the
forests.

9 And it came to pass that when
the Lamanites had come up, that the
people of Limhi began to fall upon
them from their waiting places, and
began to slay them.

10 And it came to pass that the
battle became exceedingly sore, for
they fought like lions for their prey.

11 And it came to pass that the
people of Limhi began to drive the
Lamanites before them; yet they
were not half so numerous as the
Lamanites. But they “fought for
their lives, and for their ’wives,
and for their children; therefore
they exerted themselves and like
dragons did they fight.

12 And it came to pass that they
found the king of the Lamanites

among the number of their dead;
yet he was not dead, having been
wounded and left upon the ground,
so speedy was the flight of his people.

13 And they took him and bound
up his wounds, and brought him be-
fore Limhi, and said: Behold, here
is the king of the Lamanites; he
having received a wound has fallen
among their dead, and they have left
him; and behold, we have brought
him before you; and now let us
slay him.

14 But Limhi said unto them: Ye
shall not slay him, but bring him
hither that I may see him. And they
brought him. And Limhi said unto
him: What cause have ye to come
up to war against my people? Be-
hold, my people have not broken the
oath that I made unto you; there-
fore, why should ye break the oath
which ye made unto my people?

15 And now the king said: I have
broken the oath because thy peo-
ple did carry away the daughters of
my people; therefore, in my anger
I did cause my people to come up
to war against thy people.

16 And now Limhi had heard noth-
ing concerning this matter; there-
fore he said: I will search among
my people and whosoever has done
this thing shall perish. Therefore he
caused a search to be made among
his people.

17 Now when “Gideon had heard
these things, he being the king’s
captain, he went forth and said
unto the king: I pray thee forbear,
and do not search this people, and
lay not this thing to their charge.

18 For do ye not remember the
priests of thy father, whom this
people sought to destroy? And are
they not in the wilderness? And are
not they the ones who have stolen
the daughters of the Lamanites?

19 And now, behold, and tell the
king of these things, that he may

 

186

tell his people that they may be
pacified towards us; for behold
they are already preparing to come
against us; and behold also there
are but few of us.

20 And behold, they come with
their numerous hosts; and except
the king doth pacify them towards
us we must perish.

21 For are not the words of Abin-
adi “fulfilled, which he prophesied
against us—and all this because we
would not hearken unto the words
of the Lord, and turn from our in-
iquities?

22 And now let us pacify the king,
and we fulfil the “oath which we
have made unto him; for it is bet-
ter that we should be in bondage
than that we should lose our °lives;
therefore, let us put a stop to the
shedding of so much blood.

23 And now Limhi told the king
all the things concerning his father,
and the “priests that had fled into
the wilderness, and attributed the
carrying away of their daughters
to them.

24 And it came to pass that the
king was pacified towards his peo-
ple; and he said unto them: Let us
go forth to meet my people, without
arms; and I swear unto you with an
“oath that my people shall not slay
thy people.

25 And it came to pass that they
followed the king, and went forth
without arms to meet the Laman-
ites. And it came to pass that they
did meet the Lamanites; and the
king of the Lamanites did bow
himself down before them, and did
plead in behalf of the people of
Limhi.

26 And when the Lamanites saw
the people of Limhi, that they were
without arms, they had “compassion
on them and were pacified towards
them, and returned with their king
in peace to their own land.

CHAPTER 21

Limhi’s people are smitten and defeated
by the Lamanites—Limhi’s people meet
Ammon and are converted—They tell
Ammon of the twenty-four Jaredite
plates. About 122-121 B.c.

AND it came to pass that Limhi and
his people returned to the city of
Nephi, and began to dwell in the
land again in peace.

2 And it came to pass that after
many days the Lamanites began
again to be stirred up in anger
against the Nephites, and they be-
gan to come into the borders of the
land round about.

3 Now they durst not slay them,
because of the “oath which their
king had made unto Limhi; but they
would smite them on their cheeks,
and exercise authority over them;
and began to put heavy ‘burdens
upon their backs, and drive them
as they would a dumb ass—

4 Yea, all this was done that the
«word of the Lord might be °ful-
filled.

5 And now the afflictions of the
Nephites were great, and there was
no way that they could deliver them-
selves out of their hands, for the
Lamanites had “surrounded them
on every side.

6 And it came to pass that the
people began to murmur with the
king because of their afflictions;
and they began to be desirous to
go against them to battle. And they
did afflict the king sorely with their
complaints; therefore he granted
unto them that they should do ac-
cording to their desires.

7 And they gathered themselves
together again, and put on their
armor, and went forth against the

 

MOSIAH 21:1-15

Lamanites to drive them out of their
land.

8 And it came to pass that the La-
manites did beat them, and drove
them back, and “slew many of them.

9 And now there was a great
*mourning and lamentation among
the people of Limhi, the widow
mourning for her husband, the
son and the daughter mourning
for their father, and the brothers
for their brethren.

10 Now there were a great many
“widows in the land, and they did
cry mightily from day to day, for
a great fear of the Lamanites had
come upon them.

11 And it came to pass that their
continual cries did stir up the re-
mainder of the people of Limhi to
anger against the Lamanites; and
they went again to battle, but they
were driven back again, suffering
much loss.

12 Yea, they went again even the
third time, and suffered in the like
manner; and those that were not
slain returned again to the city of
Nephi.

13 And they did humble them-
selves even to the dust, subjecting
themselves to the “yoke of bondage,
’submitting themselves to be smit-
ten, and to be driven to and fro, and
burdened, according to the desires
of their enemies.

14 And they did “humble them-
selves even in the depths of hu-
mility; and they did cry mightily
to God; yea, even all the day long
did they cry unto their God that
he would *deliver them out of their
afflictions.

15 And now the Lord was ‘slow
to hear their cry because of their
iniquities; nevertheless the Lord

did hear their "cries, and began to
soften the hearts of the Lamanites
that they began to ease their bur-
dens; yet the Lord did not see fit to
deliver them out of bondage.

16 And it came to pass that they
began to prosper by degrees in the
land, and began to raise grain more
abundantly, and flocks, and herds,
that they did not suffer with hunger.

17 Now there was a great number
of women, more than there was of
men; therefore king Limhi com-
manded that every man should 4im-
part to the support of the "widows
and their children, that they might
not perish with hunger; and this
they did because of the greatness of
their number that had been slain.

18 Now the people of Limhi kept
together in a body as much as it was
possible, and secured their grain
and their flocks;

19 And the king himself did not
trust his person without the walls
of the city, unless he took his guards
with him, fearing that he might by
some means fall into the hands of
the Lamanites.

20 And he caused that his people
should watch the land round about,
that by some means they might take
those priests that fled into the wil-
derness, who had stolen the *?daugh-
ters of the Lamanites, and that had
caused such a great destruction to
come upon them.

21 For they were desirous to take
them that they might “punish them;
for they had come into the land
of Nephi by night, and carried off
their grain and many of their pre-
cious things; therefore they laid
wait for them.

22 And it came to pass that there
was no more disturbance between
the Lamanites and the people of

 

188

Limhi, even until the time that
“Ammon and his brethren came
into the land.

23 And the king having been
without the gates of the city with
his guard, “discovered Ammon and
his brethren; and supposing them
to be priests of Noah therefore he
caused that they should be taken,
and bound, and cast into ’prison.
And had they been the priests of
Noah he would have caused that
they should be put to death.

24 But when he found that they
were not, but that they were his
brethren, and had come from the
“land of Zarahemla, he was filled
with exceedingly great joy.

25 Now king Limhi had sent, pre-
vious to the coming of Ammon, a
“small number of men to "search
for the land of Zarahemla; but they
could not find it, and they were lost
in the wilderness.

26 Nevertheless, they did find a
land which had been peopled; yea,
a land which was covered with dry
“bones; yea, a land which had been
peopled and which had been de-
stroyed; and they, having supposed
it to be the land of Zarahemla, re-
turned to the land of Nephi, having
arrived in the borders of the land
not many days before the "coming
of Ammon.

27 And they brought a “record with
them, even a record of the people
whose bones they had found; and
it was engraven on plates of ore.

28 And now Limhi was again filled
with joy on learning from the mouth
of Ammon that king Mosiah had a
“gift from God, whereby he could
‘interpret such engravings; yea, and
Ammon also did rejoice.

29 Yet Ammon and his brethren
were filled with sorrow because so

many of their brethren had been
“slain;

30 And also that king Noah and
his priests had caused the people
to commit so many sins and iniqui-
ties against God; and they also did
mourn for the “death of Abinadi;
and also for the "departure of Alma
and the people that went with him,
who had formed a church of God
through the strength and power of
God, and faith on the words which
had been spoken by Abinadi.

31 Yea, they did mourn for their de-
parture, for they knew not whither
they had fled. Now they would have
gladly joined with them, for they
themselves had entered into a “cov-
enant with God to serve him and
keep his commandments.

32 And now since the coming of
Ammon, king Limhi had also en-
tered into a covenant with God, and
also many of his people, to serve
him and keep his commandments.

33 And it came to pass that king
Limhi and many of his people were
desirous to be baptized; but there
was none in the land that had ¢au-
thority from God. And Ammon de-
clined doing this thing, considering
himself an unworthy servant.

34 Therefore they did not at that
time form themselves into a “church,
waiting upon the Spirit of the Lord.
Now they were desirous to become
even as Alma and his brethren, who
had fled into the wilderness.

35 They were desirous to be bap-
tized as a witness and a testimony
that they were willing to serve God
with all their hearts; nevertheless
they did prolong the time; and an
account of their baptism shall be
“given hereafter.

36 And now all the study of Am-
mon and “his people, and king
Limhi and his people, was to de-
liver themselves out of the hands of
the Lamanites and from "bondage.

 

MOSIAH 21:30-22:6

CHAPTER 22

Plans are made for the people to es-
cape from Lamanite bondage—The
Lamanites are made drunk—The peo-
ple escape, return to Zarahemla, and
become subject to King Mosiah. About
121-120 B.c.

AND now it came to pass that Am-
mon and king Limhi began to
consult with the people how they
should ¢deliver themselves out of
bondage; and even they did cause
that all the people should gather
themselves together; and this they
did that they might have the voice
of the people concerning the matter.

2 And it came to pass that they
could find no way to deliver them-
selves out of bondage, except it were
to take their women and children,
and their flocks, and their herds,
and their tents, and depart into the
wilderness; for the Lamanites being
so numerous, it was impossible for
the people of Limhi to contend with
them, thinking to deliver themselves
out of bondage by the sword.

3 Now it came to pass that “Gideon
went forth and stood before the
king, and said unto him: Now O
king, thou hast hitherto hearkened
unto my words many times when
we have been contending with our
brethren, the Lamanites.

4 And now O king, if thou hast
not found me to be an unprofitable
servant, or if thou hast hitherto lis-
tened to my words in any degree,
and they have been of service to
thee, even so I desire that thou
wouldst listen to my words at this
time, and I will be thy servant and
deliver this people out of bondage.

5 And the king granted unto him
that he might speak. And Gideon
said unto him:

the back wall, on the back side
of the city. The Lamanites, or the

*euards of the Lamanites, by night
are drunken; therefore let us senda
proclamation among all this people
that they gather together their flocks
and herds, that they may drive them
into the wilderness by night.

7 And I will go according to thy
command and pay the last “tribute
of wine to the Lamanites, and they
will be "drunken; and we will pass
through the secret pass on the left of
their camp when they are drunken
and asleep.

8 Thus we will depart with our
women and our children, our flocks,
and our herds into the wilderness;
and we will travel around the land
of *Shilom.

9 And it came to pass that the king
hearkened unto the words of Gideon.

10 And king Limhi caused that his
people should gather their flocks
together; and he sent the tribute of
wine to the Lamanites; and he also
sent more wine, as a present unto
them; and they did drink freely
of the wine which king Limhi did
send unto them.

11 And it came to pass that the
people of king Limhi did “depart
by night into the wilderness with
their flocks and their herds, and
they went round about the land
of °Shilom in the wilderness, and
bent their course towards the land
of Zarahemla, being led by Ammon
and his brethren.

12 And they had taken all their
gold, and silver, and their precious
things, which they could carry, and
also their provisions with them, into
the wilderness; and they pursued
their journey.

13 And after being many days in the
wilderness they “arrived in the land
of Zarahemla, and joined Mosiah’s
people, and became his subjects.

14 And it came to pass that Mosiah
“received them with joy; and he also

 

190

received their "records, and also the
‘records which had been found by
the people of Limhi.

15 And now it came to pass when
the Lamanites had found that the
people of Limhi had departed out
of the land by night, that they sent
an “army into the wilderness to
pursue them;

16 And after they had pursued
them two days, they could no lon-
ger follow their tracks; therefore
they were lost in the wilderness.

An account of Alma and the peo-
ple of the Lord, who were driven
into the wilderness by the people
of King Noah.

Comprising chapters 23 and 24.

CHAPTER 23

Alma refuses to be king—He serves as
high priest—The Lord chastens His
people, and the Lamanites conquer the
land of Helam—Amuion, leader of King
Noah's wicked priests, rules subject to the
Lamanite monarch. About 145-121 B.c.

Now Alma, having been “warned
of the Lord that the armies of king
Noah would come upon them, and
having made it known to his people,
therefore they gathered together
their flocks, and took of their grain,
and ’departed into the wilderness
before the armies of king Noah.

2 And the Lord did strengthen
them, that the people of king Noah
could not overtake them to destroy
them.

3 And they fled “eight days’ jour-
ney into the wilderness.

4 And they came to a land, yea,
even avery beautiful and pleasant
land, a land of pure water.

5 And they pitched their tents,
and began to till the ground, and

began to build buildings; yea, they
were “industrious, and did labor
exceedingly.

6 And the people were desirous
that Alma should be their “king,
for he was beloved by his people.

7 But he said unto them: Behold,
it is not expedient that we should
have a king; for thus saith the Lord:
Ye shall “not esteem one flesh above
another, or one man shall not think
himself above another; therefore
I say unto you it is not expedient
that ye should have a king.

8 Nevertheless, if it ‘were possible
that ye could always have just men
to be your kings it would be well
for you to have a king.

9 But remember the “iniquity of
king Noah and his °priests; and I
myself was ‘caught in a snare, and
did many things which were abomi-
nable in the sight of the Lord, which
caused me sore “repentance;

10 Nevertheless, “after much
*tribulation, the Lord did hear my
cries, and did answer my prayers,
and has made me an ‘instrument
in his hands in bringing “so many
of you to a knowledge of his truth.

11 Nevertheless, in this I do not
glory, for 1 am unworthy to glory
of myself.

12 And now I say unto you, ye have
been “oppressed by king Noah, and
have been in bondage to him and his
priests, and have been *brought into
iniquity by them; therefore ye were
bound with the ‘bands of iniquity.

13 And now as ye have been deliv-
ered by the power of God out of these

 

MOSIAH 23:6-21

bonds; yea, even out of the “hands of
king Noah and his people, and also
from the °bonds of iniquity, even so
I desire that ye should ‘stand fast
in this “liberty wherewith ye have
been made free, and that ye trust
“no man to be a king over you.

14 And also trust no one to be your
*teacher nor your minister, except
he be a man of God, walking in his
ways and keeping his command-
ments.

15 Thus did Alma teach his peo-
ple, that every man should “love
his *neighbor ‘as himself, that there
should be no “contention among
them.

16 And now, Alma was their “high
priest, he being the founder of their
church.

17 And it came to pass that none
received “authority to preach or to
teach except it were by him from
God. Therefore he ’consecrated all
their priests and all their teachers;
and none were consecrated except
they were just men.

18 Therefore they did watch over
their people, and did ¢nourish them
with things pertaining to righ-
teousness.

19 And it came to pass that they
began to prosper exceedingly in
the land; and they called the land
*Helam.

20 And it came to pass that they
did multiply and prosper exceed-
ingly in the land of Helam; and they
built a city, which they called the
city of Helam.

21 Nevertheless the Lord seeth fit

to ¢chasten his people; yea, he tri-
eth their "patience and their faith.

22 Nevertheless—whosoever put-
teth his “trust in him the same shall
be “lifted up at the last day. Yea,
and thus it was with this people.

23 For behold, I will show unto
you that they were brought into
“bondage, and none could deliver
them but the Lord their God, yea,
even the God of Abraham and Isaac
and of Jacob.

24 And it came to pass that he did
deliver them, and he did show forth
his mighty power unto them, and
great were their rejoicings.

25 For behold, it came to pass that
while they were in the land of He-
lam, yea, in the city of Helam, while
tilling the land round about, behold
an army of the Lamanites was in
the borders of the land.

26 Now it came to pass that the
brethren of Alma fled from their
fields, and gathered themselves
together in the city of Helam; and
they were much frightened because
of the appearance of the Lamanites.

27 But Alma went forth and stood
among them, and exhorted them
that they should not be frightened,
but that they should remember the
Lord their God and he would de-
liver them.

28 Therefore they hushed their
fears, and began to cry unto the
Lord that he would soften the hearts
of the Lamanites, that they would
spare them, and their wives, and
their children.

29 And it came to pass that the
Lord did soften the hearts of the
Lamanites, And Alma and his breth-
ren went forth and delivered them-
selves up into their hands; and the
Lamanites took possession of the
land of Helam.

30 Now the “armies of the Laman-

 

192

ites, which had followed after the
people of king Limhi, had been lost
in the wilderness for many days.

31 And behold, they had found
those priests of king Noah, in a
place which they called “Amulon;
and they had begun to possess the
land of Amulon and had begun to
till the ground.

32 Now the name of the leader of
those priests was “Amulon.

33 And it came to pass that Amulon
did plead with the Lamanites; and
he also sent forth their wives, who
were the ¢daughters of the Laman-
ites, to plead with their brethren,
that they should not destroy their
husbands.

34 And the Lamanites had ¢com-
passion on Amulon and his brethren,
and did not destroy them, because
of their wives.

35 And ¢Amulon and his brethren
did join the Lamanites, and they
were traveling in the wilderness in
search of the land of Nephi when
they discovered the land of Helam,
which was possessed by Alma and
his brethren.

36 And it came to pass that the La-
manites promised unto Alma and
his brethren, that if they would show
them the *way which led to the land
of Nephi that they would grant unto
them their lives and their liberty.

37 But after Alma had shown
them the way that led to the land
of Nephi the Lamanites would not
keep their promise; but they set
“guards round about the land of
Helam, over Alma and his brethren.

38 And the remainder of them
went to the land of Nephi; and a
part of them returned to the land
of Helam, and also brought with
them the wives and the children
of the guards who had been left in
the land.

39 And the king of the Lamanites
had granted unto Amulon that he
should be a king and a ruler over
his people, who were in the land
of Helam; nevertheless he should
have no power to do anything con-
trary to the will of the king of the
Lamanites.

CHAPTER 24

Amulon persecutes Alma and his peo-
ple—They are to be put to death if they
pray—The Lord makes their burdens
seem light—He delivers them from
bondage, and they return to Zarahemla.
About 145-120 B.c.

AND it came to pass that Amulon
did gain favor in the eyes of the
king of the Lamanites; therefore,
the king of the Lamanites granted
unto him and his brethren that they
should be appointed teachers over
his people, yea, even over the people
who were in the land of Shemlon,
and in the land of Shilom, and in
the “land of Amulon.

2 For the Lamanites had taken pos-
session of all these lands; therefore,
the king of the Lamanites had ap-
pointed kings over all these lands.

3 And now the name of the king
of the Lamanites was “Laman, be-
ing called after the name of his
father; and therefore he was called
king Laman. And he was king over
a numerous people.

4 And he appointed “teachers of
the "brethren of Amulon in every
land which was possessed by his
people; and thus the ‘language of
Nephi began to be taught among all
the people of the Lamanites.

5 And they were a people friendly
one with another; nevertheless
they knew not God; neither did the
brethren of Amulon teach them
anything concerning the Lord their

 

MOSIAH 23:39-24:13

God, neither the law of Moses; nor
did they teach them the words of
Abinadi;

6 But they taught them that they
should keep their record, and that
they might write one to another.

7 And thus the Lamanites began
to increase in riches, and began to
“trade one with another and wax
great, and began to be a cunning
and a wise people, as to the wisdom
of the world, yea, a very cunning
people, delighting in all manner of
wickedness and plunder, except it
were among their own brethren.

8 And now it came to pass that
“A mulon began to exercise "author-
ity over Alma and his brethren, and
began to persecute him, and cause
that his children should persecute
their children.

9 For Amulon knew Alma, that he
had been “one of the king’s priests,
and that it was he that believed the
words of Abinadi and was driven
out before the king, and therefore
he was wroth with him; for he was
subject to king Laman, yet he exer-
cised authority over them, and put
’tasks upon them, and put ‘task-
masters over them.

10 And it came to pass that so great
were their afflictions that they be-
gan to cry mightily to God.

11 And Amulon commanded them
that they should stop their cries; and
he “put guards over them to watch
them, that whosoever should be
found calling upon God should
be put to death.

12 And Alma and his people did
not raise their voices to the Lord
their God, but did pour out their
“hearts to him; and he did know the
’thoughts of their hearts.

13 And it “came to pass that the
voice of the Lord came to them in
their afflictions, saying: Lift up

your heads and be of good comfort,
for | know of the covenant which
ye have made unto me; and I will
covenant with my people and de-
liver them out of bondage.

14 And I will also ease the “bur-
dens which are put upon your
shoulders, that even you cannot feel
them upon your backs, even while
you are in bondage; and this will I
do that ye may stand as ’witnesses
for me hereafter, and that ye may
know of a surety that I, the Lord
God, do visit my people in their
‘afflictions.

15 And now it came to pass that
the burdens which were laid upon
Alma and his brethren were made
light; yea, the Lord did “strengthen
them that they could bear up their
*burdens with ease, and they did
submit cheerfully and with ‘pa-
tience to all the will of the Lord.

16 And it came to pass that so
great was their faith and their pa-
tience that the voice of the Lord
came unto them again, saying: Be
of good comfort, for on the morrow
I will deliver you out of bondage.

17 And he said unto Alma: Thou
shalt go before this people, and I
will go “with thee and deliver this
people out of "bondage.

18 Now it came to pass that Alma
and his people in the night-time
gathered their flocks together, and
also of their grain; yea, even all the
night-time were they gathering their
flocks together.

19 And in the morning the Lord
caused a “deep sleep to come upon
the Lamanites, yea, and all their
task-masters were in a profound
sleep.

20 And Alma and his people de-
parted into the wilderness; and
when they had traveled all day
they pitched their tents in a valley,

 

194

and they called the valley Alma,
because he led their way in the
wilderness.

21 Yea, and in the valley of Alma
they poured out their “thanks to
God because he had been merciful
unto them, and eased their °bur-
dens, and had delivered them out
of bondage; for they were in bond-
age, and none could deliver them
except it were the Lord their God.

22 And they gave “thanks to God,
yea, all their men and all their
women and all their children that
could speak lifted their voices in
the praises of their God.

23 And now the Lord said unto
Alma: Haste thee and get thou and
this people out of this land, for the
Lamanites have awakened and do
pursue thee; therefore get thee out
of this land, and I will stop the
Lamanites in this valley that they
come no further in pursuit of this
people.

24 And it came to pass that they
departed out of the valley, and took
their journey into the wilderness.

25 And after they had been in
the wilderness “twelve days they
arrived in the land of Zarahemla;
and king Mosiah did also "receive
them with joy.

CHAPTER 25

The descendants of Mulek at Zarahemla
become Nephites—They learn of the
people of Alma and of Zeniff—Alma
baptizes Limhi and all his people—
Mosiah authorizes Alma to organize the
Church of God. About 120 B.c.

AND now king Mosiah caused that
all the people should be gathered
together.

2 Now there were not so many of
the children of Nephi, or so many
of those who were descendants of

Nephi, as there were of the “people
of Zarahemla, who was a descen-
dant of "Mulek, and those who came
with him into the wilderness.

3 And there were not so many of
the people of Nephi and of the peo-
ple of Zarahemla as there were of
the Lamanites; yea, they were not
half so numerous.

4 And now all the people of Nephi
were assembled together, and also
all the people of Zarahemla, and
they were gathered together in
two bodies.

5 And it came to pass that Mosiah
did read, and caused to be read, the
records of Zeniff to his people; yea,
he read the records of the people
of Zeniff, from the time they “left
the land of Zarahemla until they
’returned again.

6 And he also read the account
of Alma and his brethren, and all
their afflictions, from the time they
left the land of Zarahemla until the
time they returned again.

7 And now, when Mosiah had made
an end of reading the records, his
people who tarried in the land were
struck with wonder and amazement.

8 For they knew not what to think;
for when they beheld those that
had been delivered “out of bondage
they were filled with exceedingly
great joy.

9 And again, when they thought of
their brethren who had been “slain
by the Lamanites they were filled
with sorrow, and even shed many
tears of sorrow.

10 And again, when they thought
of the immediate goodness of
God, and his power in delivering
Alma and his brethren out of the
hands of the Lamanites and of
“bondage, they did raise their voices
and give thanks to God.

 

MOSIAH 25:3-17

11 And again, when they thought
upon the Lamanites, who were their
brethren, of their sinful and “pol-
luted state, they were filled with
’pain and anguish for the ‘welfare
of their souls.

12 And it came to pass that those
who “were the children of Amulon
and his brethren, who had taken to
wife the daughters of the La-
manites, were displeased with the
conduct of their fathers, and they
would no longer be called by the
names of their fathers, therefore
they took upon themselves the
name of Nephi, that they might be
called the children of Nephi and
be numbered among those who
were ‘called Nephites.

13 And now all the people of
Zarahemla were “numbered with
the Nephites, and this because the
kingdom had been conferred upon
none but those who were descen-
dants of Nephi.

14 And now it came to pass that
when Mosiah had made an end of
speaking and reading to the peo-
ple, he desired that Alma should
also speak to the people.

15 And Alma did speak unto them,
when they were assembled together
in large bodies, and he went from
one body to another, preaching unto
the people repentance and faith on
the Lord.

16 And he did exhort the people of
Limhi and his brethren, all those that
had been delivered out of bondage,
that they should remember that it
was the Lord that did deliver them.

17 And it came to pass that after
Alma had taught the people many
things, and had made an end of
speaking to them, that king Limhi
was desirous that he might be
baptized; and all his people were

desirous that they might be bap-
tized also.

18 Therefore, Alma did go forth
into the water and did “baptize
them; yea, he did baptize them after
the manner he did his brethren in
the ’waters of Mormon; yea, and as
many as he did baptize did belong
to the church of God; and this be-
cause of their belief on the words
of Alma.

19 And it came to pass that king
Mosiah granted unto Alma that he
might establish “churches through-
out all the land of Zarahemla; and
gave him power to "ordain ‘priests
and “teachers over every church.

20 Now this was done because
there were so many people that they
could not all be governed by one
teacher; neither could they all hear
the word of God in one assembly;

21 Therefore they did “assemble
themselves together in different
bodies, being called churches; every
church having their priests and their
teachers, and every priest preaching
the word according as it was deliv-
ered to him by the mouth of Alma.

22 And thus, notwithstanding
there being many churches they
were all one “church, yea, even the
church of God; for there was nothing
preached in all the churches except
it were repentance and faith in God.

23 And now there were seven
churches in the land of Zarahemla.
And it came to pass that whosoever
were desirous to take upon them the
“name of Christ, or of God, they did
join the churches of God;

24 And they were called the “people
of God. And the Lord did pour out
his Spirit upon them, and they were
blessed, and prospered in the land.

 

196

CHAPTER 26

Many members of the Church are led
into sin by unbelievers—Alma is prom-
ised eternal life—Those who repent and
are baptized gain forgiveness—Church
members in sin who repent and confess
to Alma and to the Lord will be forgiven;
otherwise, they will not be numbered
among the people of the Church. About
120-100 B.c.

Now it came to pass that there were
many of the rising generation that
could not understand the “words of
king Benjamin, being little children
at the time he spake unto his peo-
ple; and they did ’not believe the
tradition of their fathers.

2 They did not believe what had
been said concerning the resurrec-
tion of the dead, neither did they
believe concerning the coming of
Christ.

3 And now because of their “un-
belief they could not "understand
the word of God; and their hearts
were hardened.

4 And they would not be baptized;
neither would they join the ¢church.
And they were a separate people
as to their faith, and remained so
ever after, even in their °carnal and
sinful state; for they would not call
upon the Lord their God.

5 And now in the reign of Mosiah
they were not half so numerous
as the people of God; but be-
cause of the *dissensions among
the brethren they became more
numerous.

6 For it came to pass that they did
“deceive many with their 'flattering
words, who were in the church, and
did cause them to commit many
sins; therefore it became expedient

that those who committed sin, that
were in the church, should be ‘ad-
monished by the church.

7 And it came to pass that they
were brought before the priests, and
delivered up unto the “priests by
the teachers; and the priests brought
them before Alma, who was the
*high priest.

8 Now king Mosiah had given Alma
the “authority over the ’church.

9 And it came to pass that Alma
did not know concerning them;
but there were many “witnesses
against them; yea, the people stood
and testified of their iniquity in
abundance.

10 Now there had not any such
thing happened before in the
church; therefore Alma was trou-
bled in his spirit, and he caused that
they should be brought before the
king.

11 And he said unto the king:
Behold, here are many whom we
have brought before thee, who are
accused of their brethren; yea, and
they have been taken in divers in-
iquities. And they do not repent of
their iniquities; therefore we have
brought them before thee, that thou
mayest judge them according to
their crimes.

12 But king Mosiah said unto Alma:
Behold, I judge them not; therefore
I *deliver them into thy hands to
be judged.

13 And now the spirit of Alma was
again troubled; and he went and in-
quired of the Lord what he should
do concerning this matter, for he
feared that he should do wrong in
the sight of God.

14 And it came to pass that after

 

MOSIAH 26:7-23

he had poured out his whole soul
to God, the “voice of the Lord came
to him, saying:

15 Blessed art thou, Alma, and
blessed are they who were baptized
in the “waters of Mormon. Thou art
blessed because of thy exceeding
’faith in the words alone of my
servant Abinadi.

16 And blessed are they because of
their exceeding faith in the words
alone which thou hast spoken unto
them.

17 And blessed art thou because
thou hast established a ¢church
among this people; and they shall
be established, and they shall be
my people.

18 Yea, blessed is this people who
are willing to bear my “name; for
in my *name shall they be called;
and they are mine.

19 And because thou hast inquired
of me concerning the transgressor,
thou art blessed.

20 Thou art my servant; and I cov-
enant with thee that thou shalt have
“eternal life; and thou shalt serve
me and go forth in my name, and
shalt gather together my sheep.

21 And he that will hear my voice
shall be my “sheep; and him shall
ye receive into the church, and him
will I also receive.

22 For behold, “this is my *church;
whosoever is ‘baptized shall be bap-
tized unto repentance. And whom-
soever ye receive shall “believe in
my name; and him will I freely
°forgive.

23 For it is | that taketh upon me
the “sins of the world; for it is I that
hath "created them; and it is I that
granteth unto him that believeth

unto the end a place at my right
hand.

24 For behold, in my name are they
called; and if they “know me they
shall come forth, and shall have a
place eternally at my right hand.

25 And it shall come to pass that
when the “second trump shall sound
then shall they that never "knew
me come forth and shall stand be-
fore me.

26 And then shall they know that
I am the Lord their God, that Iam
their Redeemer; but they would not
be redeemed.

27 And then I will confess unto
them that I never “knew them; and
they shall depart into ‘everlasting
fire prepared for the devil and his
angels.

28 Therefore I say unto you, that
he that will not “hear my voice, the
same shall ye not receive into my
church, for him I will not receive
at the last day.

29 Therefore I say unto you, Go;
and whosoever transgresseth against
me, him shall ye “judge "according
to the sins which he has commit-
ted; and if he ‘confess his sins be-
fore thee and me, and “repenteth
in the sincerity of his heart, him
shall ye ‘forgive, and I will forgive
him also.

30 Yea, and “as often as my people
’repent will I forgive them their
trespasses against me.

31 And ye shall also “forgive one
another your trespasses; for verily
I say unto you, he that forgiveth
not his *neighbor’s trespasses when
he says that he repents, the same

 

198

hath brought himself under con-
demnation.

32 Now I say unto you, Go; and
whosoever will “not repent of his
sins the same shall not be numbered
among my people; and this shall be
observed from this time forward.

33 And it came to pass when Alma
had heard these words he “wrote
them down that he might have
them, and that he might judge the
people of that church according to
the commandments of God.

34 And it came to pass that Alma
went and judged those that had
been taken in iniquity, according
to the ¢word of the Lord.

35 And whosoever repented of
their sins and did “confess them,
them he did number among the
people of the church;

36 And those that would not con-
fess their sins and repent of their in-
iquity, the same were not numbered
among the people of the church,
and their names were “blotted out.

37 And it came to pass that Alma
did regulate all the affairs of the
church; and they began again to
have peace and to prosper exceed-
ingly in the affairs of the church,
walking circumspectly before God,
receiving many, and baptizing many.

38 And now all these things did
Alma and his “fellow laborers do
who were over the church, walking
in all diligence, teaching the word
of God in all things, suffering all
manner of afflictions, being per-
secuted by all those who did not
belong to the church of God.

brethren; and they were also 4ad-
monished, every one by the word
of God, according to his sins, or to
the sins which he had committed,
being commanded of God to ’pray
without ceasing, and to give ‘thanks
in all things.

CHAPTER 27

Mosiah forbids persecution and enjoins
equality—Alma the younger and the
four sons of Mosiah seek to destroy
the Church—An angel appears and
commands them to cease their evil
course—Alma is struck dumb—All
mankind must be born again to gain
salvation—Alma and the sons of
Mosiah declare glad tidings. About
100-92 B.C.

AND now it came to pass that the
persecutions which were inflicted
on the church by the unbelievers
became so great that the church
began to murmur, and complain
to their leaders concerning the
matter; and they did complain to
Alma. And Alma laid the case be-
fore their king, Mosiah. And Mosiah
“consulted with his priests.

2 And it came to pass that king
Mosiah sent a proclamation through-
out the land round about that there
should not any unbeliever “perse-
cute any of those who belonged to
the church of God.

3 And there was a strict command
throughout all the churches that
there should be no “persecutions
among them, that there should be
an “equality among all men;

4 That they should let no pride nor
haughtiness disturb their “peace;
that every man should "esteem his

 

MOSIAH 27:1-10

‘neighbor as himself, “laboring with
their own hands for their support.

5 Yea, and all their priests and
teachers “should ‘labor with their
own hands for their support, in
all cases save it were in sickness,
or in much want; and doing these
things, they did abound in the ‘grace
of God.

6 And there began to be much
peace again in the land; and the
people began to be very numerous,
and began to scatter abroad upon the
face of the earth, yea, on the north
and on the south, on the east and on
the west, building large cities and
villages in all quarters of the land.

7 And the Lord did “visit them and
’prosper them, and they became a
large and wealthy people.

8 Now the sons of Mosiah were
numbered among the “unbelievers;
and also one of the sons of Alma was
numbered among them, he being
called Alma, after his father; never-
theless, he became a very wicked
and an Y°idolatrous man. And he
was a man of many words, and did
speak much ‘flattery to the people;
therefore he “led many of the peo-
ple to do after the manner of his
“iniquities.

9 And he became a great hinder-
ment to the prosperity of the church
of God; ‘stealing away the hearts of
the people; causing much dissension
among the people; giving a chance
for the enemy of God to exercise
his *power over them.

10 And now it came to pass that
while he was going about to “destroy
the church of God, for he did go
about secretly with the sons of Mo-
siah seeking to destroy the church,

and to lead astray the people of the
Lord, contrary to the command-
ments of God, or even the king—

11 And as I said unto you, as they
were going about “rebelling against
God, behold, the angel of the Lord
‘appeared unto them; and he de-
scended as it were in a “cloud; and
he spake as it were with a voice of
thunder, which caused the earth to
shake upon which they stood;

12 And so great was their aston-
ishment, that they fell to the earth,
and understood not the words which
he spake unto them.

13 Nevertheless he cried again, say-
ing: Alma, arise and stand forth, for
why persecutest thou the church of
God? For the Lord hath said: “This
is my church, and I will establish
it; and nothing shall overthrow
it, save it is the transgression of
my people.

14 And again, the angel said:
Behold, the Lord hath “heard the
prayers of his people, and also
the "prayers of his servant, Alma,
who is thy father; for he has ‘prayed
with much faith concerning thee
that thou mightest be brought to
the ‘knowledge of the truth; there-
fore, for this purpose have I come
to “convince thee of the power and
authority of God, that the ‘prayers
of his servants might be answered
according to their faith.

15 And now behold, can ye dis-
pute the power of God? For be-
hold, doth not my voice shake the
earth? And can ye not also “be-
hold me before you? And Lam sent
from God.

16 Now I say unto thee: Go, and

 

200

remember the captivity of thy
fathers in the land of *Helam, and
in the land of Nephi; and remember
how great things he has done for
them; for they were in "bondage,
and he has ‘delivered them. And
now I say unto thee, Alma, go thy
way, and seek to destroy the church
no more, that their prayers may be
answered, and this even if thou wilt
of “thyself be ‘cast off.

17 And now it came to pass that
these were the last words which
the angel spake unto Alma, and
he departed.

18 And now Alma and those that
were with him fell again to the
earth, for great was their aston-
ishment; for with their own eyes
they had beheld an 4angel of the
Lord; and his voice was as thunder,
which shook the earth; and they
knew that there was nothing save
the power of God that could shake
the earth and cause it to tremble
as though it would part asunder.

19 And now the astonishment of
Alma was so great that he became
#dumb, that he could not open his
mouth; yea, and he became weak,
even that he could not move his
hands; therefore he was taken by
those that were with him, and car-
ried helpless, even until he was laid
before his father.

20 And they rehearsed unto his
father all that had happened unto
them; and his father rejoiced, for
he Knew that it was the power
of God.

21 And he caused that a multitude
should be gathered together that
they might witness what the Lord

had done for his son, and also for
those that were with him.

22 And he caused that the priests
should assemble themselves to-
gether; and they began to fast,
and to pray to the Lord their God
that he would open the mouth of
Alma, that he might speak, and also
that his limbs might receive their
strength—that the eyes of the people
might be opened to see and know
of the goodness and glory of God.

23 And it came to pass after they
had fasted and prayed for the
space of “two days and two nights,
the limbs of Alma received their
strength, and he stood up and be-
gan to speak unto them, bidding
them to be of good comfort:

24 For, said he, I have repented of
my sins, and have been “redeemed
of the Lord; behold I am born of
the Spirit.

25 And the Lord said unto me: Mar-
vel not that all mankind, yea, men
and women, all nations, kindreds,
tongues and people, must be “born
again; yea, "born of God, ‘changed
from their carnal and “fallen state,
toa state of righteousness, being re-
deemed of God, becoming his “sons
and daughters;

26 And thus they become new
creatures; and unless they do this,
they can in “nowise inherit the
kingdom of God.

27 | say unto you, unless this be
the case, they must be cast off; and
this I know, because I was like to
be cast off.

28 Nevertheless, after “wading
through much "tribulation, repent-
ing nigh unto death, the Lord in

 

MOSIAH 27:22-32

mercy hath seen fit to snatch me
out of an ‘everlasting burning, and
Lam born of God.

29 My soul hath been “redeemed
from the gall of bitterness and
’bonds of iniquity. I was in the
darkest abyss; but now I behold
the marvelous light of God. My soul
was ‘racked with eternal torment;
but Iam snatched, and my soul is
4pained no more.

301 rejected my Redeemer, and
denied that which had been spoken
of by our fathers; but now that they
may foresee that he will come, and
that he remembereth every crea-
ture of his creating, he will make
himself manifest unto “all.

31 Yea, “every Knee shall bow, and
every tongue confess before him.
Yea, even at the last day, when all
men shall stand to be "judged of
him, then shall they confess that
he is “God; then shall they confess,
who live ‘without God in the world,
that the judgment of an everlast-
ing punishment is just upon them;
and they shall quake, and tremble,
and shrink beneath the glance of
his ‘all-searching eye.

32 And now it came to pass that
Alma began from this time forward
to teach the people, and those who
were with Alma at the time the
angel appeared unto them, trav-
eling round about through all the
land, publishing to all the people
the things which they had heard
and seen, and preaching the word
of God in much tribulation, being
greatly persecuted by those who
were unbelievers, being smitten by
many of them.

33 But notwithstanding all this,
they did impart much consolation
to the church, confirming their
faith, and exhorting them with long-
suffering and much travail to keep
the commandments of God.

34 And four of them were the “sons
of Mosiah; and their names were
Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner,
and Himni; these were the names
of the sons of Mosiah.

35 And they traveled through-
out all the land of Zarahemla, and
among all the “people who were
under the reign of king Mosiah,
’zealously striving to repair all the
injuries which they had done to the
church, ‘confessing all their sins,
and publishing all the things which
they had seen, and explaining the
prophecies and the scriptures to all
who desired to hear them.

36 And thus they were instru-
ments in the hands of God in bring-
ing many to the knowledge of the
truth, yea, to the knowledge of their
Redeemer.

37 And how blessed are they! For
they did “publish "peace; they did
publish good tidings of good; and
they did declare unto the people
that the Lord reigneth.

CHAPTER 28

The sons of Mosiah go to preach to the
Lamanites— Using the two seer stones,
Mosiah translates the Jaredite plates.
About 92 B.c.

Now it came to pass that after the
4sons of Mosiah had done all these
things, they took a small number
with them and returned to their
father, the king, and desired of
him that he would grant unto them

 

202

that they might, with these whom
they had ’selected, go up to the land
of ‘Nephi that they might preach
the things which they had heard,
and that they might impart the
word of God to their brethren, the
Lamanites—

2 “That perhaps they might bring
them to the knowledge of the Lord
their God, and convince them of the
iniquity of their fathers; and that
perhaps they might cure them of
their "hatred towards the Nephites,
that they might also be brought to
rejoice in the Lord their God, that
they might become friendly to
one another, and that there should
be no more contentions in all the
land which the Lord their God had
given them.

3 Now they were desirous that sal-
vation should be declared to every
creature, for they could not “bear
that any human "soul should ‘per-
ish; yea, even the very thoughts that
any soul should endure “endless
torment did cause them to quake
and ‘tremble.

4 And thus did the Spirit of the
Lord work upon them, for they were
the very “vilest of sinners. And the
Lord saw fit in his infinite ’mercy
to spare them; nevertheless they
suffered much anguish of soul be-
cause of their iniquities, suffering
much and fearing that they should
be cast off forever.

5 And it came to pass that they
did plead with their father many
days that they might go up to the
land of Nephi.

6 And king Mosiah went and “in-
quired of the Lord if he should let
his sons go up among the Laman-
ites to preach the word.

7 And the Lord said unto Mosiah:
Let them go up, for many shall
believe on their words, and they
shall have eternal life; and I will
“deliver thy sons out of the hands
of the Lamanites.

8 And it came to pass that Mosiah
granted that they might go and do
according to their request.

9 And they “took their journey into
the wilderness to go up to preach
the word among the Lamanites;
and I shall give an "account of their
proceedings hereafter.

10 Now king Mosiah had no one to
confer the kingdom upon, for there
was not any of his sons who “would
accept of the kingdom.

11 Therefore he took the records
which were engraven on the plates
of “brass, and also the plates of
’Nephi, and all the things which he
had kept and preserved according
to the commandments of God, after
having translated and caused to be
written the records which were on
the ‘plates of gold which had been
found by the people of Limhi, which
were delivered to him by the hand
of Limhi;

12 And this he did because of the
great anxiety of his people; for they
were desirous beyond measure to
know concerning those people “who
had been destroyed.

13 And now he translated them
by the means of those two “stones
which were fastened into the two
rims of a bow.

14 Now these things were prepared
from the beginning, and were
handed down from generation to
generation, for the purpose of in-
terpreting languages;

 

MOSIAH 28:7-20

15 And they have been kept and
preserved by the hand of the Lord,
that he should discover to every
creature who should possess the
land the iniquities and abomina-
tions of his people;

16 And whosoever has these things
is called “seer, after the manner of
old times.

17 Now after Mosiah had finished
“translating these ’records, behold,
it gave an account of the people
who were ‘destroyed, from the time
that they were destroyed back to
the building of the “great tower, at
the time the Lord “confounded the
language of the people and they
were scattered abroad upon the
face of all the earth, yea, and even
from that time back until the cre-
ation of Adam.

18 Now this account did cause the
people of Mosiah to mourn exceed-
ingly, yea, they were filled with
sorrow; nevertheless it gave them
much knowledge, in the which they
did rejoice.

19 And this account shall be ¢writ-
ten hereafter; for behold, it is expe-
dient that all people should know
the things which are written in
this account.

20 And now, as I said unto you,
that after king Mosiah had done
these things, he took the plates of
“brass, and all the things which
he had kept, and "conferred them
upon Alma, who was the son of Alma;
yea, all the records, and also the
‘interpreters, and conferred them
upon him, and commanded him
that he should keep and “preserve
them, and also keep a record of the
people, handing them down from

they had been handed down from
the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.

CHAPTER 29

Mosiah proposes that judges be chosen
in place of a king—Unrighteous kings
lead their people into sin—Alma the
younger is chosen chief judge by the
voice of the people—He is also the high
priest over the Church—Alma the el-
der and Mosiah die. About 92-91 B.c.

Now when Mosiah had done this
he sent out throughout all the land,
among all the people, desiring to
know their will concerning who
should be their king.

2 And it came to pass that the voice
of the people came, saying: We are
desirous that Aaron thy son should
be our king and our ruler.

3 Now Aaron had gone up to the
land of Nephi, therefore the king
could not confer the kingdom upon
him; “neither would Aaron take
upon him the kingdom; neither were
any of the "sons of Mosiah ‘willing
to take upon them the kingdom.

4 Therefore king Mosiah sent again
among the people; yea, even a writ-
ten word sent he among the people.
And these were the words that were
written, saying:

5 Behold, O ye my people, or my
brethren, for I esteem you as such,
I desire that ye should consider the
cause which ye are called to “con-
sider—for ye are desirous to have
a king.

6 Now I declare unto you that he
to whom the kingdom doth rightly
belong has declined, and will not
take upon him the kingdom.

7 And now if there should be an-
other appointed in his stead, behold
I fear there would rise “contentions

 

204

among you. And who knoweth but
what my son, to whom the king-
dom doth belong, should turn to
be angry and 'draw away a part
of this people after him, which
would cause wars and contentions
among you, which would be the
cause of shedding much blood and
perverting the way of the Lord,
yea, and destroy the souls of many
people.

8 Now [say unto you let us be wise
and consider these things, for we
have no right to destroy my son,
neither should we have any right
to destroy another if he should be
appointed in his stead.

9 And if my son should turn
again to his pride and vain things
he would recall the things which
he had said, and claim his right to
the kingdom, which would cause
him and also this people to com-
mit much sin.

10 And now let us be wise and
look forward to these things, and
do that which will make for the
peace of this people.

11 Therefore I will be your king
the remainder of my days; never-
theless, let “us appoint "judges, to
judge this people according to our
law; and we will newly arrange the
affairs of this people, for we will
appoint wise men to be judges, that
will judge this people according to
the commandments of God.

12 Now it is better that a man
should be “judged of God than of
man, for the judgments of God are
always just, but the judgments of
man are not always just.

13 Therefore, “if it were possible
that you could have °just men to be
your kings, who would establish the
‘laws of God, and judge this people
according to his commandments,

yea, if ye could have men for your
kings who would do even as my
father “Benjamin did for this
people—I say unto you, if this could
always be the case then it would
be expedient that ye should always
have kings to rule over you.

14 And even I myself have labored
with all the power and faculties
which I have possessed, to teach
you the commandments of God,
and to establish peace throughout
the land, that there should be no
wars nor contentions, no stealing,
nor plundering, nor murdering, nor
any manner of iniquity;

15 And whosoever has commit-
ted iniquity, him have I ¢punished
according to the crime which he
has committed, according to the
law which has been given to us by
our fathers.

16 Now Isay unto you, that because
all men are not just it is not expe-
dient that ye should have a “king
or kings to rule over you.

17 For behold, how much “iniquity
doth one ’wicked king cause to be
committed, yea, and what great
destruction!

18 Yea, remember king Noah, his
“wickedness and his abominations,
and also the wickedness and abomi-
nations of his people. Behold what
great destruction did come upon
them; and also because of their
iniquities they were brought into
>bondage.

19 And were it not for the inter-
position of their all-wise Creator,
and this because of their sincere
repentance, they must unavoidably
remain in bondage until now.

20 But behold, he did deliver them

 

MOSIAH 29:14-26

because they did “humble them-
selves before him; and because they
’cried mightily unto him he did
deliver them out of bondage; and
thus doth the Lord work with his
power in all cases among the chil-
dren of men, extending the arm of
“mercy towards them that put their
“trust in him.

21 And behold, now I say unto
you, ye cannot dethrone an iniqui-
tous “king save it be through much
contention, and the shedding of
much blood.

22 For behold, he has his “friends
in iniquity, and he keepeth his
guards about him; and he teareth up
the laws of those who have reigned
in righteousness before him; and he
trampleth under his feet the com-
mandments of God;

23 And he enacteth laws, and send-
eth them forth among his people,
yea, laws after the manner of his
own wickedness; and whosoever
doth not obey his laws he “causeth
to be destroyed; and whosoever doth
rebel against him he will send his
armies against them to war, and if
he can he will destroy them; and
thus an unrighteous king doth per-
vert the ways of all righteousness.

24 And now behold I say unto you,
it is not expedient that such abomi-
nations should come upon you.

25 Therefore, choose you by the
*voice of this people, judges, that
ye may be *judged according to the
‘laws which have been given you
by our fathers, which are correct,
and which were given them by the
hand of the Lord.

26 Now it is not common that
the “voice of the people desireth

anything "contrary to that which
is right; but it is common for the
lesser part of the ‘people to desire
that which is not right; therefore
this shall ye observe and make it
your law—to do your business by
the voice of the people.

27 And “if the time comes that
the voice of the people doth choose
iniquity, then is the time that the
judgments of God will come upon
you; yea, then is the time he will
visit you with great destruction even
as he has hitherto visited this land.

28 And now if ye have judges, and
they do not “judge you according to
the law which has been given, ye
can cause that they may be judged
of a higher judge.

29 If your higher judges do not
judge righteous judgments, ye shall
cause that a small number of your
lower judges should be gathered
together, and they shall judge your
higher judges, according to the voice
of the people.

30 And I command you to do these
things in the fear of the Lord; and
Icommand you to do these things,
and that ye have no king; that if
these people commit sins and iniq-
uities they shall be answered upon
their own heads.

31 For behold I say unto you, the
sins of many people have been
“caused by the iniquities of their
kings; therefore their iniquities
are answered upon the heads of
their kings.

32 And now I desire that this 4in-
equality should be no more in this
land, especially among this my peo-
ple; but I desire that this land bea
land of "liberty, and ‘every man may
enjoy his rights and privileges alike,
so long as the Lord sees fit that we
may live and inherit the land, yea,

 

206

even as long as any of our posterity
remains upon the face of the land.

33 And many more things did king
Mosiah write unto them, unfolding
unto them all the trials and “trou-
bles of a righteous king, yea, all the
travails of soul for their people, and
also all the murmurings of the peo-
ple to their king; and he explained
it all unto them.

34 And he told them that these
things ought not to be; but that
the burden should come upon all
the people, that every man might
“bear his part.

35 And he also unfolded unto them
all the disadvantages they labored
under, by having an unrighteous
*king to rule over them;

36 Yea, all “his iniquities and
abominations, and all the wars, and
contentions, and bloodshed, and the
stealing, and the plundering, and
the committing of whoredoms, and
all manner of iniquities which can-
not be enumerated—telling them
that these things ought not to be,
that they were expressly repugnant
to the commandments of God.

37 And now it came to pass, after
king Mosiah had sent these things
forth among the people they were
“convinced of the truth of his words.

38 Therefore they relinquished
their desires for a king, and became
exceedingly anxious that every
man should have an equal “chance
throughout all the land; yea, and
every man expressed a willingness
to answer for his own sins.

39 Therefore, it came to pass that
they assembled themselves together
in bodies throughout the land, to
cast in their *voices concerning who
should be their "judges, to judge
them according to the ‘law which
had been given them; and they were

exceedingly rejoiced because of the
“liberty which had been granted
unto them.

40 And they did wax strong in love
towards Mosiah; yea, they did esteem
him more than any other man; for
they did not look upon him as a
“tyrant who was seeking for gain, yea,
for that "lucre which doth ‘corrupt
the soul; for he had not exacted riches
of them, neither had he delighted in
the shedding of blood; but he had
established “peace in the land, and
he had granted unto his people that
they should be delivered from all
manner of bondage; therefore they
did esteem him, yea, exceedingly,
beyond measure.

41 And it came to pass that they did
“appoint “judges to rule over them,
or to judge them according to the
law; and this they did throughout
all the land.

42 And it came to pass that Alma
was appointed to be the first ¢chief
judge, he being also the "high priest,
his father having conferred the of-
fice upon him, and having given

 

MOSIAH 29:40-47

him the charge concerning all the
affairs of the church.

43 And now it came to pass that
Alma did ¢walk in the ways of the
Lord, and he did keep his command-
ments, and he did judge righteous
judgments; and there was continual
peace through the land.

44 And thus commenced the “reign
of the judges throughout all the land
of Zarahemla, among all the peo-
ple who were called the Nephites;
and Alma was the first and chief
judge.

45 And now it came to pass that
his father died, being eighty and
two years old, having lived to fulfil
the commandments of God.

46 And it came to pass that Mo-
siah “died also, in the thirty and
third year of his reign, being ’sixty
and three years old; making in the
whole, five hundred and nine years
from the time Lehi left Jerusalem.

47 And thus ended the reign of the
kings over the people of Nephi; and
thus ended the days of Alma, who
was the founder of their church.

OW it came to pass that in

the first year of the reign
of the judges over the people
of Nephi, from this time forward,
king Mosiah having “gone the way
of all the earth, having warred a
good warfare, walking uprightly
before God, leaving none to reign
in his stead; nevertheless he had
established "laws, and they were
acknowledged by the people; there-
fore they were obliged to abide by
the ‘laws which he had made.

2 And it came to pass that in the
first year of the reign of Alma in
the judgment-seat, there was a “man
brought before him to be judged, a
man who was large, and was noted
for his much strength.

3 And he had gone about among
the people, preaching to them that
which he “termed to be the word
of God, bearing down *against the
church; declaring unto the people
that every priest and teacher ought
to become ‘popular; and they ought
4not to labor with their hands, but
that they ought to be supported by
the people.

4 And he also testified unto the
people that ¢all mankind should be
saved at the last day, and that they
’need not fear nor tremble, but that
they might lift up their heads and
rejoice; for the Lord had ‘created
all men, and had also ¢redeemed all
men; and, in the end, all men should
have eternal life.

5 And it came to pass that he did
teach these things so much that
many did believe on his words,
even so many that they began to
support him and give him “money.

 

208

6 And he began to be lifted up in
the pride of his heart, and to wear
very costly “apparel, yea, and even
began to "establish a “church after
the manner of his preaching.

7 And it came to pass as he was
going, to preach to those who be-
lieved on his word, he met a man
who belonged to the church of God,
yea, even one of their “teachers;
and he began to contend with him
sharply, that he might lead away
the people of the church; but the
man withstood him, admonishing
him with the ’words of God.

8 Now the name of the man was
*Gideon; and it was he who was an
instrument in the hands of God in
delivering the people of Limhi out
of bondage.

9 Now, because Gideon withstood
him with the words of God he was
wroth with Gideon, and drew his
sword and began to smite him. Now
Gideon being “stricken with many
years, therefore he was not able to
withstand his blows, therefore he
was ’slain by the sword.

10 And the man who slew him was
taken by the people of the church,
and was brought before Alma, to
be “judged according to the crimes
which he had committed.

11 And it came to pass that he stood
before Alma and pled for himself
with much boldness.

12 But Alma said unto him: Be-
hold, this is the first time that
*priestcraft has been introduced
among this people. And behold,
thou art not only guilty of priest-
craft, but hast endeavored to en-
force it by the sword; and were

’priestcraft to be enforced among
this people it would prove their
entire destruction.

13 And thou hast shed the “blood
of a righteous man, yea, aman who
has done much good among this
people; and were we to spare thee
his blood would come upon us for
vengeance.

14 Therefore thou art condemned
to “die, according to the "law which
has been given us by Mosiah, our
last king; and it has been ‘acknowl-
edged by this people; therefore this
people must “abide by the law.

15 And it came to pass that they
took him; and his name was ¢Nehor;
and they carried him upon the top
of the hill Manti, and there he was
caused, or rather did acknowledge,
between the heavens and the earth,
that what he had taught to the peo-
ple was contrary to the word of God;
and there he suffered an ignomini-
ous death.

16 Nevertheless, this did not put an
end to the spreading of priestcraft
through the land; for there were
many who loved the vain things
of the world, and they went forth
preaching “false doctrines; and
this they did for the sake of ’riches
and honor.

17 Nevertheless, they durst not
“lie, if it were known, for fear of
the law, for liars were punished;
therefore they pretended to preach
according to their belief; and now
the law could have no power on
any man for °his belief.

18 And they durst not “steal, for
fear of the law, for such were pun-
ished; neither durst they rob, nor

 

ALMA 1:13-25

murder, for he that murdered was
punished unto ‘death.

19 But it came to pass that whoso-
ever did not belong to the church
of God began to persecute those
that did belong to the church of
God, and had taken upon them the
name of Christ.

20 Yea, they did persecute them,
and afflict them with all manner
of words, and this because of their
humility; because they were not
proud in their own eyes, and be-
cause they did impart the word
of God, one with another, without
*money and without price.

21 Now there was a strict law
among the people of the church, that
there should “not any man, belong-
ing to the church, arise and perse-
cute those that did not belong to the
church, and that there should be
no persecution among themselves.

22 Nevertheless, there were many
among them who began to be proud,
and began to contend warmly with
their adversaries, even unto blows;
yea, they would smite one another
with their fists.

23 Now this was in the second year
of the reign of Alma, and it was a
cause of much affliction to the
church; yea, it was the cause of much
trial with the church.

24 For the hearts of many were
hardened, and their names were
*blotted out, that they were remem-
bered no more among the people
of God. And also many °withdrew
themselves from among them.

25 Now this was a great trial to
those that did stand fast in the faith;
nevertheless, they were “steadfast

and immovable in keeping the
commandments of God, and they
bore with "patience the persecution
which was heaped upon them.

26 And when the priests left their
“labor to impart the word of God
unto the people, the people also left
their labors to hear the word of God.
And when the priest had imparted
unto them the word of God they
all returned again diligently unto
their labors; and the priest, not es-
teeming himself above his hearers,
for the preacher was no better than
the hearer, neither was the teacher
any better than the learner; and
thus they were all equal, and they
did all labor, every man ’according
to his strength.

27 And they did “impart of their
substance, every man according
to that which he had, to the "poor,
and the needy, and the sick, and
the afflicted; and they did not wear
costly ‘apparel, yet they were neat
and comely.

28 And thus they did establish
the affairs of the church; and thus
they began to have continual peace
again, notwithstanding all their
persecutions.

29 And now, because of the steadi-
ness of the church they began to
be exceedingly “rich, having abun-
dance of all things whatsoever
they stood in need—an abundance
of flocks and herds, and fatlings of
every kind, and also abundance of
grain, and of gold, and of silver, and
of precious things, and abundance
of ’silk and fine-twined linen, and
all manner of good homely ‘cloth.

30 And thus, in their “prosperous

 

210

circumstances, they did not send
away any who were "naked, or that
were hungry, or that were athirst,
or that were sick, or that had not
been nourished; and they did not
set their hearts upon ‘riches; there-
fore they were “liberal to all, both
old and young, both bond and free,
both male and female, whether
out of the church or in the church,
having no ‘respect to persons as to
those who stood in need.

31 And thus they did “prosper and
become far more wealthy than those
who did not belong to their church.

32 For those who did not belong
to their church did indulge them-
selves in 4sorceries, and in "idolatry
or ‘idleness, and in “babblings, and
in ‘envyings and ‘strife; wearing
costly apparel; being ‘lifted up in
the pride of their own eyes; per-
secuting, lying, thieving, robbing,
committing whoredoms, and mur-
dering, and all manner of wicked-
ness; nevertheless, the law was put in
force upon all those who did trans-
gress it, inasmuch as it was possible.

33 And it came to pass that by
thus exercising the law upon them,
every man suffering according to
that which he had done, they became
more still, and durst not commit
any wickedness if it were known;
therefore, there was much peace
among the people of Nephi until the
fifth year of the reign of the judges.

make war on the Nephites and are de-
feated—The Lamanites and Amiicites
join forces and are defeated—Alma
slays Amlici. About 87 B.c.

AND it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the fifth year of their
reign there began to be a contention
among the people; for a certain
4man, being called Amlici, he being
a very cunning man, yea, a wise
man as to the wisdom of the world,
he being after the order of the man
that slew "Gideon by the sword, who
was executed according to the law—

2 Now this Amlici had, by his cun-
ning, “drawn away much people
after him; even so much that they
began to be very powerful; and they
began to endeavor to establish Am-
lici to be a king over the people.

3 Now this was alarming to the
people of the church, and also to all
those who had not been drawn away
after the persuasions of Amlici;
for they knew that according to their
law that such things must be estab-
lished by the “voice of the people.

4 Therefore, if it were possible
that Amlici should gain the voice
of the people, he, being a wicked
man, would “deprive them of their
rights and privileges of the church;
for it was his intent to destroy the
church of God.

5 And it came to pass that the peo-
ple assembled themselves together
throughout all the land, every man
according to his mind, whether it
were for or against Amlici, in sepa-
rate bodies, having much dispute
and wonderful “contentions one
with another.

6 And thus they did assemble
themselves together to cast in their
“voices concerning the matter; and
they were laid before the judges.

 

ALMA 2:1-15

7 And it came to pass that the
*voice of the people came against
Amilici, that he was not made king
over the people.

8 Now this did cause much joy
in the hearts of those who were
against him; but Amlici did stir up
those who were in his favor to anger
against those who were not in his
favor.

9 And it came to pass that they
gathered themselves together, and
did “consecrate Amlici to be their
king.

10 Now when Amlici was made
king over them he commanded
them that they should take up arms
against their brethren; and this
he did that he might subject them
to him.

11 Now the people of Amlici were
distinguished by the name of Am-
lici, being called “Amlicites; and the
remainder were ’called Nephites,
or the people of God.

12 Therefore the people of the
Nephites were aware of the intent
of the Amlicites, and therefore they
did prepare to meet them; yea,
they did arm themselves with swords,
and with cimeters, and with bows, and
with arrows, and with stones, and
with slings, and with all manner
of ‘weapons of war, of every kind.

13 And thus they were prepared
to meet the Amlicites at the time
of their coming. And there were
appointed “captains, and higher
captains, and chief captains, ac-
cording to their numbers.

14 And it came to pass that Amlici
did arm his men with all manner of
weapons of war of every kind; and
he also appointed rulers and lead-
ers over his people, to lead them to
war against their brethren.

15 And it came to pass that the

Amlicites came upon the hill Am-
nihu, which was east of the “river
Sidon, which ran by the "land of
Zarahemla, and there they began
to make war with the Nephites.

16 Now Alma, being the “chief
judge and the "governor of the peo-
ple of Nephi, therefore he went up
with his people, yea, with his cap-
tains, and chief captains, yea, at
the head of his armies, against the
Amlicites to battle.

17 And they began to slay the Am-
licites upon the hill east of Sidon.
And the Amlicites did contend with
the Nephites with great strength,
insomuch that many of the Neph-
ites did fall before the Amlicites.

18 Nevertheless the Lord did
strengthen the hand of the Nephites,
that they slew the Amlicites with
great slaughter, that they began to
flee before them.

19 And it came to pass that the
Nephites did pursue the Amlicites
all that day, and did slay them with
much slaughter, insomuch that there
were “slain of the Amlicites twelve
thousand five hundred thirty and
two souls; and there were slain of
the Nephites six thousand five hun-
dred sixty and two souls.

20 And it came to pass that when
Alma could pursue the Amlicites
no longer he caused that his peo-
ple should pitch their tents in the
“valley of Gideon, the valley being
called after that Gideon who was
slain by the hand of "Nehor with
the sword; and in this valley the
Nephites did pitch their tents for
the night.

21 And Alma sent spies to follow
the remnant of the Amlicites, that
he might know of their plans and
their plots, whereby he might guard
himself against them, that he might
preserve his people from being
destroyed.

 

212

22 Now those whom he had sent
out to watch the camp of the Amli-
cites were called Zeram, and Amnor,
and Manti, and Limher; these were
they who went out with their men
to watch the camp of the Amlicites.

23 And it came to pass that on the
morrow they returned into the camp
of the Nephites in great haste, be-
ing greatly astonished, and struck
with much fear, saying:

24 Behold, we followed the “camp
of the "Amlicites, and to our great
astonishment, in the land of Mi-
non, above the land of Zarahemla,
in the course of the land of “Nephi,
we saw a numerous host of the La-
manites; and behold, the Amlicites
have joined them;

25 And they are upon our brethren
in that land; and they are fleeing
before them with their flocks, and
their wives, and their children, to-
wards our city; and except we make
haste they obtain possession of our
city, and our fathers, and our wives,
and our children be slain.

26 And it came to pass that the
people of Nephi took their tents,
and departed out of the valley of
Gideon towards their “city, which
was the city of °Zarahemla.

27 And behold, as they were cross-
ing the river Sidon, the Lamanites
and the Amlicites, being as “nu-
merous almost, as it were, as the
sands of the sea, came upon them
to destroy them.

28 Nevertheless, the Nephites be-
ing “strengthened by the hand of
the Lord, having prayed mightily
to him that he would deliver them
out of the hands of their enemies,
therefore the Lord did hear their
cries, and did strengthen them, and
the Lamanites and the Amlicites
did fall before them.

29 And it came to pass that Alma
fought with Amlici with the sword,

face to face; and they did contend
mightily, one with another.

30 And it came to pass that Alma,
being a man of God, being exercised
with much “faith, cried, saying: O
Lord, have mercy and "spare my
life, that I may be an instrument
in thy hands to save and preserve
this people.

31 Now when Alma had said these
words he contended again with
Amlici; and he was strengthened,
insomuch that he slew Amlici with
the sword.

32 And he also contended with the
king of the Lamanites; but the king
of the Lamanites fled back from
before Alma and sent his guards to
contend with Alma.

33 But Alma, with his guards, con-
tended with the guards of the king
of the Lamanites until he slew and
drove them back.

34 And thus he cleared the ground,
or rather the bank, which was on the
west of the river Sidon, throwing the
bodies of the Lamanites who had
been slain into the waters of Sidon,
that thereby his people might have
room to cross and contend with the
Lamanites and the Amlicites on the
west side of the river Sidon.

35 And it came to pass that when
they had all crossed the river Sidon
that the Lamanites and the Amlicites
began to flee before them, notwith-
standing they were so numerous
that they could not be numbered.

36 And they fled before the Neph-
ites towards the wilderness which
was west and north, away beyond
the borders of the land; and the
Nephites did pursue them with their
might, and did slay them.

37 Yea, they were met on every
hand, and slain and driven, until
they were scattered on the west, and
on the north, until they had reached
the wilderness, which was called
Hermounts; and it was that part of

 

ALMA 2:30-3:5

the wilderness which was infested
by wild and ravenous beasts.

38 And it came to pass that many
died in the wilderness of their
wounds, and were devoured by those
beasts and also the vultures of the air;
and their bones have been found, and
have been heaped up on the earth.

CHAPTER 3

The Amiicites had marked themselves
according to the prophetic word—The
Lamanites had been cursed for their
rebellion—Men bring their own curses
upon themselves—The Nephites de-
feat another Lamanite army. About
87-86 B.C.

AND it came to pass that the Nephites
who were not “slain by the weapons
of war, after having buried those
who had been slain—now the num-
ber of the slain were not numbered,
because of the greatness of their
number—after they had finished
burying their dead they all returned
to their lands, and to their houses,
and their wives, and their children.

2 Now many women and children
had been slain with the sword, and
also many of their flocks and their
herds; and also many of their fields of
grain were destroyed, for they were
trodden down by the hosts of men.

3 And now as many of the Laman-
ites and the Amlicites who had been
slain upon the bank of the river Si-
don were cast into the ‘waters of
Sidon; and behold their bones are
in the depths of the "sea, and they
are many.

4 And the “Amlicites were distin-
guished from the Nephites, for they
had ’marked themselves with red
in their foreheads after the manner
of the Lamanites; nevertheless they
had not shorn their heads like unto
the Lamanites.

5 Now the heads of the Lamanites
were shorn; and they were “naked,

save it were skin which was girded
about their loins, and also their
armor, which was girded about
them, and their bows, and their
arrows, and their stones, and their
slings, and so forth.

6 And the skins of the Lamanites
were dark, according to the mark
which was set upon their fathers,
which was a “curse upon them be-
cause of their transgression and
their rebellion against their breth-
ren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob,
and Joseph, and Sam, who were just
and holy men.

7 And their brethren sought to
destroy them, therefore they were
cursed; and the Lord God set a
#mark upon them, yea, upon Laman
and Lemuel, and also the sons of
Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women.

8 And this was done that their seed
might be distinguished from the
seed of their brethren, that thereby
the Lord God might preserve his
people, that they might not ¢mix
and believe in incorrect *traditions
which would prove their destruction.

9 And it came to pass that whoso-
ever did mingle his seed with that
of the Lamanites did bring the same
curse upon his seed.

10 Therefore, whosoever suffered
himself to be led away by the La-
manites was called under that
head, and there was a mark set
upon him.

11 And it came to pass that whoso-
ever would not believe in the “tradi-
tion of the Lamanites, but believed
those records which were brought
out of the land of Jerusalem, and
also in the tradition of their fathers,
which were correct, who believed
in the commandments of God and
kept them, were ’called the Neph-
ites, or the people of Nephi, from
that time forth—

 

214

12 And it is they who have kept
the records which are “true of their
people, and also of the people of
the Lamanites.

13 Now we will return again to
the Amlicites, for they also had a
*mark set upon them; yea, they set
the mark upon themselves, yea,
even a mark of red upon their
foreheads.

14 Thus the word of God is ful-
filled, for these are the words which
he said to Nephi: Behold, the La-
manites have I cursed, and I will
set a mark on them that they and
their seed may be “separated from
thee and thy seed, from this time
henceforth and forever, except they
repent of their wickedness and
’turn to me that I may have mercy
upon them.

15 And again: I will set a mark
upon him that mingleth his seed
with thy brethren, that they may
be cursed also.

16 And again: I will set a mark
upon him that fighteth against thee
and thy seed.

17 And again, I say he that de-
parteth from thee shall no more
be called thy seed; and I will bless
thee, and whomsoever shall be
called thy seed, henceforth and
forever; and these were the prom-
ises of the Lord unto Nephi and to
his seed.

18 Now the Amlicites knew not
that they were fulfilling the words
of God when they began to mark
themselves in their foreheads; nev-
ertheless they had come out in open
“rebellion against God; therefore it
was expedient that the curse should
fall upon them.

19 Now I would that ye should
see that they brought upon them-
selves the “curse; and even so doth
every man that is cursed bring

upon himself his own condem-
nation.

20 Now it came to pass that not
many days after the battle which
was fought in the land of Zara-
hemla, by the Lamanites and the
Amlicites, that there was another
army of the Lamanites came in
upon the people of Nephi, in the
4same place where the first army
met the Amlicites.

21 And it came to pass that there
was an army sent to drive them out
of their land.

22 Now Alma himself being af-
flicted with a “wound did not go
up to battle at this time against the
Lamanites;

23 But he sent up a numerous army
against them; and they went up and
slew many of the Lamanites, and
drove the remainder of them out of
the borders of their land.

24 And then they returned again
and began to establish peace in the
land, being troubled no more fora
time with their enemies.

25 Now all these things were done,
yea, all these wars and contentions
were commenced and ended in
the fifth year of the reign of the
judges.

26 And in one year were thou-
sands and tens of thousands of souls
sent to the eternal world, that they
might reap their *rewards according
to their works, whether they were
good or whether they were bad, to
reap eternal happiness or eternal
misery, according to the spirit which
they listed to obey, whether it bea
good spirit or a bad one.

27 For every man receiveth “wages
of him whom he listeth to "obey, and
this according to the words of the
spirit of prophecy; therefore let it
be according to the truth. And thus

 

ALMA 3:20-4:5

endeth the fifth year of the reign
of the judges.

CHAPTER 4

Alma baptizes thousands of con-
verts—Iniquity enters the Church,
and the Church’s progress is hindered—
Nephihah is appointed chief judge—
Alma, as high priest, devotes himself to
the ministry. About 86-83 B.C.

Now it came to pass in the sixth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi, there were no
contentions nor wars in the “land
of Zarahemla;

2 But the people were afflicted,
yea, greatly afflicted for the loss of
their brethren, and also for the “loss
of their flocks and herds, and also
for the loss of their fields of grain,
which were trodden under foot and
destroyed by the Lamanites.

3 And so great were their afflic-
tions that every soul had cause to
mourn; and they believed that it
was the judgments of God sent upon
them because of their wickedness
and their abominations; therefore
they were “awakened to a remem-
brance of their duty.

4 And they began to establish the
“church more fully; yea, and many
were "baptized in the ‘waters of Si-
don and were joined to the church
of God; yea, they were baptized by
the hand of Alma, who had been
consecrated the “high priest over
the people of the church, by the
hand of his father Alma.

5 And it came to pass in the seventh
year of the reign of the judges there
were about three thousand five hun-
dred souls that united themselves to
the ¢church of God and were baptized.
And thus ended the seventh year of
the reign of the judges over the people

of Nephi; and there was continual
peace in all that time.

6 And it came to pass in the eighth
year of the reign of the judges,
that the people of the church be-
gan to wax proud, because of their
exceeding “riches, and their fine
silks, and their fine-twined linen,
and because of their many flocks
and herds, and their gold and their
silver, and all manner of precious
things, which they had obtained
by their ‘industry; and in all these
things were they lifted up in the
pride of their eyes, for they began
to wear very costly “apparel.

7 Now this was the cause of much
affliction to Alma, yea, and to many
of the people whom Alma had con-
secrated to be “teachers, and "priests,
and ‘elders over the church; yea,
many of them were sorely grieved
for the wickedness which they saw
had begun to be among their people.

8 For they saw and beheld with
great sorrow that the people of the
church began to be lifted up in the
pride of their eyes, and to set their
*hearts upon riches and upon the
vain things of the world, that they
began to be scornful, one towards
another, and they began to persecute
those that did not believe accord-
ing to their own will and pleasure.

9 And thus, in this eighth year of
the reign of the judges, there began
to be great “contentions among the
people of the church; yea, there were
’envyings, and ‘strife, and malice,
and persecutions, and pride, even
to exceed the pride of those who
did not belong to the church of God.

10 And thus ended the eighth

 

216

year of the reign of the judges; and
the wickedness of the church was
a great “stumbling-block to those
who did not belong to the church;
and thus the church began to fail
in its progress.

11 And it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the ninth year, Alma
saw the wickedness of the church,
and he saw also that the “example
of the church began to lead those
who were unbelievers on from one
piece of iniquity to another, thus
bringing on the destruction of the
people.

12 Yea, he saw great inequality
among the people, some lifting
themselves up with their pride, de-
spising others, turning their backs
upon the “needy and the naked and
those who were "hungry, and those
who were athirst, and those who
were sick and afflicted.

13 Now this was a great cause for
lamentations among the people,
while others were abasing them-
selves, succoring those who stood in
need of their succor, such as impart-
ing their substance to the “poor and
the needy, feeding the hungry, and
suffering all manner of *afflictions,
for Christ’s “sake, who should come
according to the spirit of prophecy;

14 Looking forward to that day,
thus “retaining a ’remission of
their sins; being filled with great
‘joy because of the resurrection of
the dead, according to the will and
power and @deliverance of Jesus
Christ from the bands of death.

15 And now it came to pass that

the humble followers of God, and

the persecutions which were heaped
upon them by the remainder of his
people, and seeing all their “in-
equality, began to be very sorrow-
ful; nevertheless the Spirit of the
Lord did not fail him.

16 And he selected a wise man
who was among the “elders of the
church, and gave him power ac-
cording to the °voice of the people,
that he might have power to enact
‘laws according to the laws which
had been given, and to put them in
force according to the wickedness
and the crimes of the people.

17 Now this man’s name was
*Nephihah, and he was appointed
’chief judge; and he sat in the
judgment-seat to judge and to gov-
ern the people.

18 Now Alma did not grant unto
him the office of being “high priest
over the church, but he retained the
office of high priest unto himself;
but he delivered the judgment-seat
unto "Nephihah.

19 And this he did that he “himself
might go forth among his people,
or among the people of Nephi, that
he might "preach the ‘word of God
unto them, to ‘stir them up in ‘re-
membrance of their duty, and that
he might pull down, by the word
of God, all the pride and craftiness
and all the contentions which were
among his people, seeing no way
that he might reclaim them save it
were in bearing down in pure ‘tes-
timony against them.

20 And thus in the commencement
of the ninth year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi,
Alma delivered up the judgment-seat
to *Nephihah, and confined himself

 

ALMA 4:16-5:3

wholly to the "high priesthood of
the holy order of God, to the ‘testi-
mony of the word, according to the
spirit of revelation and prophecy.

The words which Alma, the High
Priest according to the holy order
of God, delivered to the people in
their cities and villages throughout
the land.

Beginning with chapter 5.

CHAPTER 5

To gain salvation, men must repent
and keep the commandments, be born
again, cleanse their garments through
the blood of Christ, be humble and strip
themselves of pride and envy, and do
the works of righteousness—T he Good
Shepherd calls His people—Those who
do evil works are children of the devil—
Alma testifies of the truth of his doctrine
and commands men to repent—The
names of the righteous will be written
in the book of life. About 83 B.c.

Now it came to pass that Alma be-
gan to “deliver the word of 'God
unto the people, first in the land
of Zarahemla, and from thence
throughout all the land.

2 And these are the words which
he spake to the people in the church
which was established in the city
of Zarahemla, according to his own
record, saying:

31, Alma, having been “conse-
crated by my father, Alma, to bea
*high priest over the church of God,
he having power and ‘authority
from God to do these things, be-
hold, Isay unto you that he began to

establish a church in the “land which
was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the
land which was called the land of
Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his
brethren in the waters of Mormon.

4 And behold, I say unto you, they
were “delivered out of the hands
of the people of king Noah, by the
mercy and power of God.

5 And behold, after that, they were
brought into “bondage by the hands
of the Lamanites in the wilderness;
yea, I say unto you, they were in
captivity, and again the Lord did
deliver them out of "bondage by
the power of his word; and we were
brought into this land, and here
we began to establish the church
of God throughout this land also.

6 And now behold, I say unto you,
my brethren, you that belong to
this church, have you sufficiently
retained in “remembrance the cap-
tivity of your fathers? Yea, and have
you sufficiently retained in remem-
brance his mercy and long-suffering
towards them? And moreover, have
ye sufficiently retained in remem-
brance that he has ’delivered their
souls from hell?

7 Behold, he changed their hearts;
yea, he awakened them out of a deep
sleep, and they awoke unto God.
Behold, they were in the midst of
darkness; nevertheless, their souls
were illuminated by the light of
the everlasting word; yea, they
were encircled about by the “bands
of death, and the "chains of hell,
and an everlasting destruction did
await them.

8 And now I ask of you, my
brethren, were they destroyed?

 

218

Behold, I say unto you, Nay, they
were not.

9 And again Lask, were the bands
of death broken, and the “chains of
hell which encircled them about,
were they loosed? I say unto you,
Yea, they were loosed, and their
souls did expand, and they did ’sing
redeeming love. And I say unto you
that they are saved.

10 And now Lask of you on what
conditions are they “saved? Yea,
what grounds had they to hope
for salvation? What is the cause of
their being loosed from the bands
of death, yea, and also the chains
of hell?

11 Behold, I can tell you—did
not my father Alma believe in the
words which were delivered by the
*mouth of Abinadi? And was he not
a holy prophet? Did he not speak
the words of God, and my father
Alma believe them?

12 And according to his faith there
was a mighty “change wrought in
his heart. Behold I say unto you
that this is all true.

13 And behold, he “preached
the word unto your fathers, and a
mighty change was also wrought
in their hearts, and they humbled
themselves and put their "trust in
the true and ‘living God. And be-
hold, they were faithful until the
4end; therefore they were saved.

14 And now behold, I ask of you,
my brethren of the church, have
ye ‘spiritually been born of God?
Have ye received his image in your
countenances? Have ye experienced
this mighty ‘change in your hearts?

15 Do ye exercise faith in the

redemption of him who “created
you? Do you look forward with an
eye of faith, and view this mortal
body raised in immortality, and
this corruption "raised in incor-
ruption, to stand before God to
be ‘judged according to the deeds
which have been done in the mortal
body?

16 Isay unto you, can you imagine
to yourselves that ye hear the voice
of the Lord, saying unto you, in that
day: Come unto me ye “blessed, for
behold, your works have been the
works of righteousness upon the
face of the earth?

17 Or do ye “imagine to yourselves
that ye can lie unto the Lord in
that day, and "say—Lord, our works
have been righteous works upon
the face of the earth—and that he
will save you?

18 Or otherwise, can ye imagine
yourselves brought before the tri-
bunal of God with your souls filled
with guilt and remorse, having a
remembrance of all your guilt, yea,
a perfect “remembrance of all your
wickedness, yea, a remembrance
that ye have set at defiance the
commandments of God?

19 I say unto you, can ye look up
to God at that day with a pure heart
and clean hands? I say unto you,
can you look up, having the “image
of God engraven upon your counte-
nances?

20 I say unto you, can ye think of
being saved when you have yielded
yourselves to become “subjects to
the devil?

21 I say unto you, ye will know at
that day that ye cannot be “saved;

 

ALMA 5:16-26

for there can no man be saved
except his "garments are washed
white; yea, his garments must be
‘purified until they are cleansed
from all stain, through the blood
of him of whom it has been spo-
ken by our fathers, who should
come to redeem his people from
their sins.

22 And now Lask of you, my breth-
ren, how will any of you feel, if ye
shall stand before the bar of God,
having your garments stained with
“blood and all manner of *filthiness?
Behold, what will these things tes-
tify against you?

23 Behold will they not “testify
that ye are murderers, yea, and also
that ye are "guilty of all manner of
wickedness?

24 Behold, my brethren, do ye
suppose that such an one can have
a place to sit down in the king-
dom of God, with “Abraham, with
Isaac, and with Jacob, and also all
the holy prophets, whose garments
are cleansed and are spotless, pure
and white?

25 Lsay unto you, Nay; except ye
make our Creator a liar from the
beginning, or suppose that he isa
liar from the beginning, ye cannot
suppose that such can have place
in the kingdom of heaven; but
they shall be cast out for they are
the “children of the kingdom of
the devil.

26 And now behold, I say unto you,
my brethren, if ye have experienced
a “change of heart, and if ye have
felt to sing the "song of redeem-
ing love, 1 would ask, ‘can ye feel
so now?

27 Have ye walked, keeping your-
selves “blameless before God? Could
ye say, if ye were called to die at this
time, within yourselves, that ye have
been sufficiently "humble? That
your garments have been ‘cleansed
and made white through the blood
of Christ, who will come to “redeem
his people from their sins?

28 Behold, are ye stripped of “pride?
I say unto you, if ye are not ye are
not prepared to meet God. Behold ye
must prepare quickly; for the king-
dom of heaven is soon at hand, and
such an one hath not eternal life.

29 Behold, I say, is there one among
you who is not stripped of “envy? |
say unto you that such an one is not
prepared; and I would that he should
prepare "quickly, for the hour is
close at hand, and he knoweth not
when the time shall come; for such
an one is not found guiltless.

30 And again I say unto you, is
there one among you that doth
make a“mock of his brother, or that
heapeth upon him persecutions?

31 Wo unto such an one, for he
is not prepared, and the “time is
at hand that he must repent or he
cannot be saved!

32 Yea, even wo unto all ye ¢work-
ers of iniquity; repent, repent, for
the Lord God hath spoken it!

33 Behold, he sendeth an invita-
tion unto @all men, for the °arms of
mercy are extended towards them,
and he saith: Repent, and I will
receive you.

 

220

34 Yea, he saith: “Come unto me
and ye shall partake of the fruit
of the tree of life; yea, ye shall eat
and drink of the ‘bread and the
waters of life “freely;

35 Yea, come unto me and bring
forth works of righteousness, and
ye shall not be hewn down and cast
into the fire—

36 For behold, the time is at hand
that whosoever “*bringeth forth
not good fruit, or whosoever do-
eth not the works of righteousness,
the same have cause to wail and
mourn.

37 Oye workers of iniquity; ye that
are “puffed up in the vain things of
the world, ye that have professed
to have known the ways of righ-
teousness nevertheless have gone
bastray, as “sheep having no “shep-
herd, notwithstanding a shepherd
hath ‘called after you and is still
calling after you, but ye will not
fhearken unto his voice!

38 Behold, I say unto you, that the
good “shepherd doth call you; yea,
and in his own name he doth call
you, which is the name of Christ;
and if ye will not "hearken unto
the voice of the ‘good shepherd, to
the ‘name by which ye are called,
behold, ye are not the sheep of the
good shepherd.

39 And now if ye are not the “sheep
of the good shepherd, of what fold
are ye? Behold, I say unto you,
that the 'devil is your shepherd,
and ye are of his fold; and now,

who can deny this? Behold, I say
unto you, whosoever denieth this
is a ‘liar and a “child of the devil.

40 For I say unto you that what-
soever is “good cometh from God,
and whatsoever is "evil cometh
from the devil.

41 Therefore, if a man bringeth
forth “good works he hearkeneth
unto the voice of the good shepherd,
and he doth follow him; but who-
soever bringeth forth evil works,
the same becometh a ’child of the
devil, for he hearkeneth unto his
voice, and doth follow him.

42 And whosoever doeth this must
receive his “wages of him; there-
fore, for his "wages he receiveth
‘death, as to things pertaining unto
righteousness, being dead unto all
good works.

43 And now, my brethren, I would
that ye should hear me, for I speak
in the “energy of my soul; for behold,
Ihave spoken unto you plainly that
ye cannot err, or have spoken accord-
ing to the commandments of God.

44 For I am called to speak after
this manner, according to the “holy
order of God, which is in Christ
Jesus; yea, I am commanded to
stand and testify unto this people
the things which have been spo-
ken by our fathers concerning the
things which are to come.

45 And this is not all. Do ye not
suppose that I “know of these things
myself? Behold, I testify unto you
that I do know that these things
whereof I have spoken are true. And
how do ye suppose that I know of
their surety?

46 Behold, I say unto you they
are made “known unto me by the

 

ALMA 5:40-50

Holy Spirit of God. Behold, I have
’fasted and prayed many days that
I might know these things of my-
self. And now I do know of myself
that they are true; for the Lord God
hath made them manifest unto me
by his Holy Spirit; and this is the
spirit of ‘revelation which is in me.

47 And moreover, I say unto you
that it has thus been revealed unto
me, that the words which have been
spoken by our fathers are true, even
so according to the spirit of proph-
ecy which is in me, which is also
by the manifestation of the Spirit
of God.

48 I say unto you, that I know of
myself that whatsoever I shall say
unto you, concerning that which
is to come, is true; and I say unto
you, that I know that Jesus Christ
shall come, yea, the Son, the Only
Begotten of the Father, full of grace,
and mercy, and truth. And behold,
it is he that cometh to take away
the sins of the world, yea, the sins
of every man who steadfastly be-
lieveth on his name.

49 And now I say unto you that
this is the “order after which Iam
called, yea, to preach unto my be-
loved brethren, yea, and every one
that dwelleth in the land; yea, to
preach unto all, both old and young,
both bond and free; yea, I say unto
you the aged, and also the middle
aged, and the rising generation; yea,
to cry unto them that they must
repent and be "born again.

50 Yea, thus saith the Spirit: Repent,
all ye ends of the earth, for the
kingdom of heaven is soon at hand;
yea, the Son of God cometh in his
*elory, in his might, majesty, power,

and dominion. Yea, my beloved
brethren, I say unto you, that the
Spirit saith: Behold the glory of
the ’King of all the earth; and
also the King of heaven shall very
soon shine forth among all the chil-
dren of men.

51 And also the Spirit saith unto
me, yea, crieth unto me witha
mighty voice, saying: Go forth and
say unto this people—Repent, for
except ye repent ye can in nowise
inherit the “kingdom of "heaven.

52 And again I say unto you,
the Spirit saith: Behold, the “ax is
laid at the root of the tree; there-
fore every tree that bringeth not
forth good fruit shall be "hewn
down and cast into the fire, yea,
a fire which cannot be consumed,
even an unquenchable fire. Behold,
and remember, the Holy One hath
spoken it.

53 And now my beloved brethren,
I say unto you, can ye withstand
these sayings; yea, can ye lay aside
these things, and “trample the Holy
One under your feet; yea, can ye be
>ouffed up in the pride of your hearts;
yea, will ye still persist in the wear-
ing of ‘costly apparel and setting
your hearts upon the vain things
of the world, upon your “riches?

54 Yea, will ye persist in supposing
that ye are better one than another;
yea, will ye persist in the persecu-
tion of your brethren, who humble
themselves and do walk after the
holy order of God, wherewith they
have been brought into this church,
having been “sanctified by the Holy
Spirit, and they do bring forth works
which are meet for repentance—

 

222

55 Yea, and will you persist in
turning your backs upon the “poor,
and the needy, and in withholding
your substance from them?

56 And finally, all ye that will per-
sist in your wickedness, I say unto
you that these are they who shall
be hewn down and cast into the
fire except they speedily repent.

57 And now I say unto you, all
you that are desirous to follow the
voice of the “good shepherd, come
ye out from the wicked, and be
ye "separate, and touch not their
unclean things; and behold, their
names shall be ‘blotted out, that
the names of the wicked shall not
be numbered among the names
of the righteous, that the word of
God may be fulfilled, which saith:
The names of the wicked shall
not be mingled with the names of
my people;

58 For the names of the righteous
shall be written in the “book of life,
and unto them will I grant an inheri-
tance at my right hand. And now,
my brethren, what have ye to say
against this? I say unto you, if ye
speak against it, it matters not, for
the word of God must be fulfilled.

59 For what shepherd is there
among you having many sheep
doth not watch over them, that the
wolves enter not and devour his
flock? And behold, if a wolf enter
his “flock doth he not drive him
out? Yea, and at the last, if he can,
he will destroy him.

60 And now I say unto you that
the good shepherd doth call after
you; and if you will hearken unto
his voice he will bring you into his

commandeth you that ye suffer no
ravenous wolf to enter among you,
that ye may not be destroyed.

61 And now I, Alma, do command
you in the language of “him who
hath commanded me, that ye ob-
serve to do the words which I have
spoken unto you.

62 I speak by way of command
unto you that belong to the church;
and unto those who do not belong
to the church I speak by way of
invitation, saying: Come and be
baptized unto repentance, that ye
also may be partakers of the fruit
of the “tree of life.

CHAPTER 6

The Church in Zarahemla is cleansed
and set in order—Alma goes to Gideon
to preach. About 83 B.c.

AND now it came to pass that after
Alma had made an end of speak-
ing unto the people of the church,
which was established in the city of
Zarahemla, he ‘ordained "priests
and elders, by laying on his “hands
according to the order of God, to
preside and 4watch over the church.

2 And it came to pass that whoso-
ever did not belong to the church
who “repented of their sins were
baptized unto repentance, and were
received into the church.

3 And it also came to pass that
whosoever did belong to the church
that did not “repent of their wick-
edness and humble themselves
before God—I mean those who
were lifted up in the "pride of their
hearts—the same were rejected,
and their names were ‘blotted out,
that their names were not numbered
among those of the righteous.

 

4 And thus they began to establish

ALMA 5:61-6:8

the order of the church in the “city
of Zarahemla.

5 Now I would that ye should un-
derstand that the word of God was
liberal unto all, that none were
deprived of the privilege of assem-
bling themselves together to hear
the word of God.

6 Nevertheless the children of God
were commanded that they should
gather themselves together oft, and
join in “fasting and mighty prayer
in behalf of the welfare of the souls
of those who knew not God.

7 And now it came to pass that
when Alma had made these regu-
lations he departed from them, yea,
from the church which was in the
city of Zarahemla, and went over
upon the east of the “river Sidon, into
the ’valley of Gideon, there having
been a city built, which was called
the city of Gideon, which was in
the valley that was called Gideon,
being called after the man who was
‘slain by the hand of Nehor with
the sword.

8 And Alma went and began to
declare the word of God unto the
church which was established in
the valley of Gideon, according to
the revelation of the truth of the
word which had been spoken by
his fathers, and according to the
spirit of prophecy which was in
him, according to the “testimony of
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who
should come to redeem his people
from their sins, and the holy order
by which he was called. And thus
it is written. Amen.

The words of Alma which he
delivered to the people in Gideon,
according to his own record.

CHAPTER 7

Christ will be born of Mary—He will
loose the bands of death and bear the
sins of His people—Those who repent,
are baptized, and keep the command-
ments will have eternal life—Filthiness
cannot inherit the kingdom of God—
Humility, faith, hope, and charity are
required. About 83 B.C.

BEHOLD my beloved brethren, see-
ing that I have been permitted to
come unto you, therefore I attempt
to address you in my language; yea,
by my “own mouth, seeing that it
is the first time that I have spo-
ken unto you by the words of my
mouth, I having been wholly con-
fined to the *judgment-seat, having
had much business that I could not
come unto you.

2 And even I could not have come
now at this time were it not that
the judgment-seat hath been “given
to another, to reign in my stead;
and the Lord in much mercy hath
granted that I should come unto you.

3 And behold, I have come having
great hopes and much desire that
I should find that ye had humbled
yourselves before God, and that ye
had continued in the supplicating
of his grace, that I should find that
ye were blameless before him, that I
should find that ye were not in the
awful “dilemma that our brethren
were in at Zarahemla.

4 But blessed be the name of God,
that he hath given me to know, yea,
hath given unto me the exceedingly
great joy of knowing that they are
established again in the way of his
righteousness.

5 And I trust, according to the
Spirit of God which is in me, that I
shall also have joy over you; never-
theless I do not desire that my joy
over you should come by the cause

 

224

of so much afflictions and sorrow
which I have had for the brethren
at Zarahemla, for behold, my joy
cometh over them after wading
through much affliction and sorrow.

6 But behold, I trust that ye are
not in a state of so much unbelief
as were your brethren; I trust that
ye are not lifted up in the pride
of your hearts; yea, I trust that ye
have not set your hearts upon riches
and the vain things of the world;
yea, I trust that you do not worship
4idols, but that ye do worship the
true and the living God, and that
ye look forward for the remission
of your sins, with an everlasting
faith, which is to come.

7 For behold, I[say unto you there
be many things to come; and be-
hold, there is one thing which is
of more importance than they all—
for behold, the “time is not far dis-
tant that the Redeemer liveth and
cometh among his people.

8 Behold, I do not say that he will
come among us at the “time of his
dwelling in his mortal tabernacle;
for behold, the Spirit hath not said
unto me that this should be the
case. Now as to this thing I do not
know; but this much I do know,
that the Lord God hath power to do
all things which are according to
his word.

9 But behold, the Spirit hath said
this much unto me, saying: Cry unto
this people, saying—*Repent ye,
and prepare the way of the Lord,
and walk in his paths, which are
straight; for behold, the kingdom
of heaven is at hand, and the Son
of God cometh upon the face of
the earth.

10 And behold, he shall be “born
of Mary, at "Jerusalem which is the
‘land of our forefathers, she being
a ‘virgin, a precious and chosen

vessel, who shall be overshadowed
and “conceive by the power of the
Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son,
yea, even the Son of God.

11 And he shall go forth, suffering
pains and “afflictions and *tempta-
tions of every kind; and this that the
word might be fulfilled which saith
he will ‘take upon him the pains
and the sicknesses of his people.

12 And he will take upon him
“death, that he may “loose the bands
of death which bind his people;
and he will take upon him their
infirmities, that his bowels may be
filled with mercy, according to the
flesh, that he may know according
to the flesh how to ‘succor his peo-
ple according to their infirmities.

13 Now the Spirit “knoweth all
things; nevertheless the Son of God
suffereth according to the flesh that
he might ‘take upon him the sins of
his people, that he might blot out
their transgressions according to
the power of his deliverance; and
now behold, this is the testimony
which is in me.

14 Now I say unto you that ye
must “repent, and be born again;
for the Spirit saith if ye are not
born again ye cannot inherit the
kingdom of heaven; therefore come
and be baptized unto repentance,
that ye may be washed from your
sins, that ye may have faith on the
Lamb of God, who taketh away the
sins of the world, who is mighty
to save and to cleanse from all un-
righteousness.

15 Yea, I say unto you come and
fear not, and lay aside every sin,
which easily doth “beset you, which
doth bind you down to destruction,
yea, come and go forth, and show
unto your God that ye are willing

 

ALMA 7:11-20

to repent of your sins and enter
into a covenant with him to keep
his commandments, and witness
it unto him this day by going into
the waters of baptism.

16 And whosoever doeth this,
and keepeth the commandments
of God from thenceforth, the same
will *remember that I say unto him,
yea, he will remember that I have
said unto him, he shall have eter-
nal life, according to the testimony
of the Holy Spirit, which testifieth
in me.

17 And now my beloved brethren,
do you believe these things? Be-
hold, I say unto you, yea, I know
that ye believe them; and the way
that I know that ye believe them is
by the manifestation of the Spirit
which is in me. And now because
your faith is strong concerning that,
yea, concerning the things which I
have spoken, great is my joy.

18 For as I said unto you from the
beginning, that I had much desire
that ye were not in the state of @di-
lemma like your brethren, even so
I have found that my desires have
been gratified.

19 For I perceive that ye are in
the paths of righteousness; I per-
ceive that ye are in the path which
leads to the kingdom of God; yea,
I perceive that ye are making his
“paths straight.

20 I perceive that it has been made
known unto you, by the testimony
of his word, that he cannot ¢walk
in crooked paths; neither doth he
vary from that which he hath said;
neither hath he a shadow of turning
from the right to the left, or from
that which is right to that which is
wrong; therefore, his course is one
eternal round.

21 And he doth not dwell in “un-
holy temples; neither can filthiness
or anything which is unclean be
received into the kingdom of God;
therefore I say unto you the time
shall come, yea, and it shall be at
the last day, that he who is ’filthy
shall remain in his filthiness.

22 And now my beloved brethren, I
have said these things unto you that
I might awaken you to a sense of
your duty to God, that ye may walk
blameless before him, that ye may
walk after the holy order of God,
after which ye have been received.

23 And now I would that ye should
be “humble, and be "submissive and
gentle; easy to be entreated; full of
patience and long-suffering; be-
ing temperate in all things; being
diligent in keeping the command-
ments of God at all times; asking
for whatsoever things ye stand in
need, both spiritual and temporal;
always returning thanks unto God
for whatsoever things ye do receive.

24 And see that ye have “faith,
hope, and charity, and then ye will
always abound in good works.

25 And may the Lord bless you,
and keep your garments spotless,
that ye may at last be brought to
sit down with “Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, and the holy prophets who
have been ever since the world be-
gan, having your garments "spotless
even as their garments are spotless,
in the kingdom of heaven to go no
more out.

26 And now my beloved brethren,
I have spoken these words unto
you according to the Spirit which
testifieth in me; and my soul doth
exceedingly rejoice, because of the
exceeding diligence and heed which
ye have given unto my word.

27 And now, may the “peace of God

 

226

rest upon you, and upon your houses
and lands, and upon your flocks and
herds, and all that you possess, your
women and your children, accord-
ing to your faith and good works,
from this time forth and forever.
And thus I have spoken. Amen.

CHAPTER 8

Alma preaches and baptizes in Me-
lek—He is rejected in Ammonihah
and leaves—An angel commands him
to return and cry repentance unto the
people—He is received by Amulek, and
the two of them preach in Ammonihah.
About 82 B.C.

AND now it came to pass that Alma
returned from the “land of Gideon,
after having taught the people of
Gideon many things which cannot
be written, having established the
border of the church, according as
he had before done in the land of
Zarahemla, yea, he returned to his
own house at Zarahemla to rest
himself from the labors which he
had performed.

2 And thus ended the ninth year
of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

3 And it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the tenth year of the
reign of the judges over the people
of Nephi, that Alma departed from
thence and took his journey over
into the land of “Melek, on the west
of the ’river Sidon, on the west by
the borders of the wilderness.

4 And he began to teach the peo-
ple in the land of Melek according
to the “holy order of God, by which
he had been called; and he began
to teach the people throughout all
the land of Melek.

5 And it came to pass that the
people came to him throughout all

the borders of the land which was by
the wilderness side. And they were
baptized throughout all the land;

6 So that when he had finished his
work at Melek he departed thence,
and traveled three days’ journey on
the north of the land of Melek; and
he came to a city which was called
¢Ammonihah.

7 Now it was the custom of the
people of Nephi to call their lands,
and their cities, and their villages,
yea, even all their small villages, af-
ter the “name of him who first pos-
sessed them; and thus it was with
the land of Ammonihah.

8 And it came to pass that when
Alma had come to the city of Am-
monihah he began to preach the
word of God unto them.

9 Now Satan had gotten great “hold
upon the hearts of the people of the
city of Ammonihah; therefore they
would not hearken unto the words
of Alma.

10 Nevertheless Alma “labored
much in the spirit, "wrestling with
God in ‘mighty prayer, that he
would pour out his Spirit upon the
people who were in the city; that
he would also grant that he might
baptize them unto repentance.

11 Nevertheless, they hardened
their hearts, saying unto him: Behold,
we know that thou art Alma; and we
know that thou art high priest over
the church which thou hast estab-
lished in many parts of the land,
according to your tradition; and we
are not of thy church, and we do not
believe in such foolish traditions.

12 And now we know that because
we are not of thy church we know
that thou hast no power over us; and
thou hast delivered up the judgment-
seat unto *Nephihah; therefore thou
art not the chief judge over us.

 

ALMA 8:6-19

13 Now when the people had said
this, and withstood all his words,
and “reviled him, and spit upon
him, and caused that he should be
’cast out of their city, he departed
thence and took his journey towards
the city which was called Aaron.

14 And it came to pass that while
he was journeying thither, being
weighed down with sorrow, wading
through much “tribulation and an-
guish of soul, because of the wicked-
ness of the people who were in the
city of Ammonihah, it came to pass
while Alma was thus weighed down
with sorrow, behold an ’angel of the
Lord appeared unto him, saying:

15 Blessed art thou, Alma; there-
fore, lift up thy head and rejoice, for
thou hast great cause to rejoice;
for thou hast been faithful in keep-
ing the commandments of God from
the time which thou receivedst thy
first message from him. Behold, I
am he that “delivered it unto you.

16 And behold, Iam sent to “com-
mand thee that thou return to the
city of Ammonihah, and preach
again unto the people of the city;
yea, preach unto them. Yea, say unto
them, except they repent the Lord
God will °destroy them.

17 For behold, they do study at
this time that they may destroy
the liberty of thy people, (for thus
saith the Lord) which is contrary to
the “statutes, and judgments, and
commandments which he has given
unto his people.

18 Now it came to pass that after
Alma had received his message from
the angel of the Lord he returned
speedily to the land of Ammonihah.
And he entered the city by another
way, yea, by the way which is on
the south of the city of Ammonihah.

19 And as “he entered the city he

was an hungered, and he said to
a man: Will ye give to an humble
servant of God something to eat?

20 And the man said unto him: I
ama Nephite, and I know that thou
art a holy prophet of God, for thou
art the man whom an “angel said in
a vision: Thou shalt receive. There-
fore, go with me into my house
and I will impart unto thee of my
’food; and I know that thou wilt be
a blessing unto me and my house.

21 And it came to pass that the
man received him into his house;
and the man was called Amulek;
and he brought forth bread and
meat and set before Alma.

22 And it came to pass that Alma
ate bread and was filled; and he
“blessed Amulek and his house, and
he gave thanks unto God.

23 And after he had eaten and
was filled he said unto Amulek: I
am Alma, and am the “high priest
over the church of God throughout
the land.

24 And behold, I have been called
to preach the word of God among all
this people, according to the spirit
of revelation and prophecy; and I
was in this land and they would
not receive me, but they “cast me
out and I was about to set my back
towards this land forever.

25 But behold, I have been com-
manded that I should turn again and
prophesy unto this people, yea, and
to testify against them concerning
their iniquities.

26 And now, Amulek, because thou
hast fed me and taken me in, thou
art blessed; for I was an hungered,
for I had fasted many days.

27 And Alma “tarried many days
with Amulek before he began to
preach unto the people.

28 And it came to pass that the
people did wax more gross in their
iniquities.

29 And the word came to Alma,

 

228

saying: Go; and also say unto my ser-
vant “Amulek, go forth and prophesy
unto this people, saying—Repent
ye, for thus saith the Lord, except
ye repent I will visit this people in
mine anger; yea, and I will not turn
my °fierce anger away.

30 And Alma went forth, and also
Amulek, among the people, to de-
clare the words of God unto them;
and they were filled with the Holy
Ghost.

31 And they had “power given unto
them, insomuch that they could
not be confined in dungeons; nei-
ther was it possible that any man
could slay them; nevertheless they
did not exercise their "power un-
til they were bound in bands and
cast into prison. Now, this was done
that the Lord might show forth his
power in them.

32 And it came to pass that they
went forth and began to preach
and to prophesy unto the people,
according to the spirit and power
which the Lord had given them.

The words of Alma, and also the
words of Amulek, which were de-
clared unto the people who were
in the land of Ammonihah. And
also they are cast into prison, and
delivered by the miraculous power
of God which was in them, accord-
ing to the record of Alma.

Comprising chapters 9 through 14.

CHAPTER 9

Alma commands the people of Am-
monihah to repent—The Lord will be
merciful to the Lamanites in the last
days—If the Nephites forsake the light,
they will be destroyed by the Laman-
ites—The Son of God will come soon—
He will redeem those who repent, are
baptized, and have faith in His name.

AND again, I, Alma, having been
commanded of God that I should
take Amulek and go forth and
preach again unto this people, or
the people who were in the city of
¢Ammonihah, it came to pass as I
began to preach unto them, they
began to contend with me, saying:

2 Who art thou? Suppose ye that we
shall believe the testimony of “one
man, although he should preach
unto us that the earth should pass
away?

3 Now they understood not the
words which they spake; for they
knew not that the earth should
pass away.

4 And they said also: We will not
believe thy words if thou shouldst
prophesy that this great city should
be destroyed in “one day.

5 Now they knew not that God
could do such marvelous “works,
for they were a hard-hearted and
a stiffnecked people.

6 And they said: “Who is God, that
sendeth ’no more authority than one
man among this people, to declare
unto them the truth of such great
and marvelous things?

7 And they stood forth to lay their
hands on me; but behold, they did
not. And I stood with boldness to
declare unto them, yea, I did boldly
testify unto them, saying:

8 Behold, O ye wicked and perverse
“generation, how have ye forgotten
the "tradition of your fathers; yea,
how soon ye have forgotten the
commandments of God.

9 Do ye not remember that our
father, Lehi, was brought out of Je-
rusalem by the “hand of God? Do
ye not remember that they were all
led by him through the wilderness?

10 And have ye forgotten so soon

 

ALMA 9:1-15

how many times he “delivered our
fathers out of the hands of their
enemies, and preserved them from
being destroyed, even by the hands
of their own brethren?

11 Yea, and if it had not been for
his matchless power, and his mercy,
and his “long-suffering towards us,
we should unavoidably have been
cut off from the face of the earth
long before this period of time, and
perhaps been consigned to a state
of "endless misery and woe.

12 Behold, now I say unto you that
he commandeth you to repent; and
except ye repent, ye can in nowise
inherit the kingdom of God. But
behold, this is not all—he has com-
manded you to repent, or he will
utterly “destroy you from off the
face of the earth; yea, he will visit
you in his ’anger, and in his ‘fierce
anger he will not turn away.

13 Behold, do ye not remember the
words which he spake unto Lehi, say-
ing that: “Inasmuch as ye shall keep
my commandments, ye shall pros-
per in the land? And again it is said
that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep
my commandments ye shall be cut
off from the presence of the Lord.

14 Now I would that ye should
remember, that inasmuch as the
Lamanites have not kept the com-
mandments of God, they have been
*cut off from the presence of the
Lord. Now we see that the word of
the Lord has been verified in this
thing, and the Lamanites have been
cut off from his presence, from the
beginning of their transgressions
in the land.

15 Nevertheless I say unto you,
that it shall be more “tolerable for
them in the day of judgment than
for you, if ye remain in your sins,

yea, and even more tolerable for
them in this life than for you, ex-
cept ye repent.

16 For there are many promises
which are “extended to the Laman-
ites; for it is because of the *tradi-
tions of their fathers that caused
them to remain in their state of
‘ignorance; therefore the Lord will
be merciful unto them and “prolong
their existence in the land.

17 And at some period of time
they will be “brought to believe in
his word, and to know of the incor-
rectness of the traditions of their
fathers; and many of them will be
saved, for the Lord will be merci-
ful unto all who ’call on his name.

18 But behold, I say unto you that
if ye persist in your wickedness that
your days shall not be “prolonged
in the land, for the "Lamanites shall
be sent upon you; and if ye repent
not they shall come in a time when
you know not, and ye shall be vis-
ited with ‘utter destruction; and
it shall be according to the fierce
4anger of the Lord.

19 For he will not suffer you that
ye shall live in your iniquities,
to “destroy his people. I say unto
you, Nay; he would rather suffer
that the Lamanites might destroy
all his people who are called the
people of Nephi, if it were possible
that they could "fall into sins and
transgressions, after having had
so much light and so much kKnowl-
edge given unto them of the Lord
their God;

20 Yea, after having been such a
highly favored people of the Lord;
yea, after having been favored
above every other “nation, kindred,

 

230

tongue, or people; after having had
all things *’made known unto them,
according to their desires, and their
faith, and prayers, of that which has
been, and which is, and which is
to come;

21 Having been “visited by the
Spirit of God; having conversed
with angels, and having been spo-
ken unto by the voice of the Lord;
and having the spirit of prophecy,
and the spirit of revelation, and also
many gifts, the gift of speaking with
tongues, and the gift of preaching,
and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and
the gift of translation;

22 Yea, and after having been
“delivered of God out of the land
of Jerusalem, by the hand of the
Lord; having been ’saved from
famine, and from sickness, and all
manner of diseases of every kind;
and they having waxed strong in
battle, that they might not be de-
stroyed; having been brought out of
‘bondage time after time, and hav-
ing been kept and preserved until
now; and they have been prospered
until they are rich in all manner of
things—

23 And now behold I say unto you,
that if this people, who have re-
ceived so many blessings from the
hand of the Lord, should transgress
“contrary to the light and knowl-
edge which they do have, I say unto
you that if this be the case, that if
they should fall into transgression,
it would be far more "tolerable for
the Lamanites than for them.

24 For behold, the “promises of the
Lord are extended to the Lamanites,
but they are not unto you if ye trans-
gress; for has not the Lord expressly

promised and firmly decreed, that
if ye will rebel against him that ye
shall °utterly be destroyed from off
the face of the earth?

25 And now for this cause, that ye
may not be destroyed, the Lord has
sent his angel to visit many of his
people, declaring unto them that
they must go forth and cry mightily
unto this people, saying: “Repent
ye, for the kingdom of heaven is
nigh at hand;

26 And “not many days hence the
Son of God shall come in his ’glory;
and his glory shall be the glory of
the Only Begotten of the Father,
full of ‘grace, equity, and truth,
full of patience, “mercy, and long-
suffering, quick to “hear the cries
of his people and to answer their
prayers.

27 And behold, he cometh to 4re-
deem those who will be "baptized
unto repentance, through faith on
his name.

28 Therefore, prepare ye the way
of the Lord, for the time is at hand
that all men shall reap a “reward
of their "works, according to that
which they have been—if they have
been righteous they shall ‘reap the
salvation of their souls, according to
the power and deliverance of Jesus
Christ; and if they have been evil
they shall reap the ‘damnation of
their souls, according to the power
and captivation of the devil.

29 Now behold, this is the voice of
the angel, crying unto the people.

30 And now, my “beloved breth-
ren, for ye are my brethren, and ye
ought to be beloved, and ye ought
to bring forth works which are meet
for repentance, seeing that your
hearts have been grossly hardened
against the word of God, and see-

 

ALMA 9:25-10:2

ing that ye are a “lost and a fallen
people.

31 Now it came to pass that when
I, Alma, had spoken these words,
behold, the people were wroth
with me because I said unto them
that they were a hard-hearted and
a ‘stiffnecked people.

32 And also because I said unto
them that they were a lost and a
fallen people they were angry with
me, and sought to lay their hands
upon me, that they might cast me
into prison.

33 But it came to pass that the
Lord did not suffer them that they
should take me “at that time and
cast me into prison.

34 And it came to pass that Amu-
lek went and stood forth, and be-
gan to preach unto them also. And
now the “words of Amulek are not
all written, nevertheless a part of
his words are written in this book.

CHAPTER 10

Lehi descended from Manasseh—Amu-
lek recounts the angelic command that
he care for Alma—tThe prayers of the
righteous cause the people to be spared—
Unrighteous lawyers and judges lay the
foundation of the destruction of the
people. About 82 B.c.

Now these are the “words which
’Amulek preached unto the people
who were in the land of Ammoni-
hah, saying:

2 lam Amulek; lam the son of Gid-
donah, who was the son of Ishmael,
who was a descendant of Aminadi;
and it was that same Aminadi who
interpreted the “writing which
was upon the wall of the temple,
which was written by the finger
of God.

3 And Aminadi was a descendant
of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi,
who came out of the land of Jeru-
salem, who was a descendant of
*Manasseh, who was the son of
’Joseph who was ‘sold into Egypt
by the hands of his brethren.

4 And behold, Iam also a man of
no small “reputation among all those
who know me; yea, and behold, I
have many kindreds and °friends,
and I have also acquired much riches
by the hand of my ‘industry.

5 Nevertheless, after all this, I
never have known much of the
ways of the Lord, and his “mysteries
and marvelous power. I said I never
had known much of these things;
but behold, I mistake, for I have
seen much of his mysteries and his
marvelous power; yea, even in the
preservation of the lives of this
people.

6 Nevertheless, I did harden my
heart, for | was “called many times
and I would not *hear; therefore I
knew concerning these things, yet
I would not know; therefore I went
on rebelling ‘against God, in the
wickedness of my heart, even un-
til the fourth day of this seventh
month, which is in the tenth year
of the reign of the judges.

7 As I was journeying to see a very
near kindred, behold an “angel of
the Lord appeared unto me and
said: Amulek, return to thine own
house, for thou shalt feed a prophet
of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is
a chosen man of God; for he has
‘fasted many days because of the
sins of this people, and he is an hun-
gered, and thou shalt ‘receive him
into thy house and feed him, and
he shall bless thee and thy house;

 

232

and the blessing of the Lord shall
rest upon thee and thy house.

8 And it came to pass that I obeyed
the voice of the angel, and returned
towards my house. And as I was go-
ing thither I found the “man whom
the angel said unto me: Thou shalt
receive into thy house—and behold
it was this same man who has been
speaking unto you concerning the
things of God.

9 And the angel said unto me he is
a “holy man; wherefore I know he
is a holy man because it was said
by an angel of God.

10 And again, I know that the
things whereof he hath testified
are true; for behold I say unto you,
that as the Lord liveth, even so has he
sent his “angel to make these things
manifest unto me; and this he has
done while this Alma hath 'dwelt
at my house.

11 For behold, he hath “blessed
mine house, he hath blessed me,
and my women, and my children,
and my father and my kinsfolk; yea,
even all my kindred hath he blessed,
and the blessing of the Lord hath
rested upon us according to the
words which he spake.

12 And now, when Amulek had
spoken these words the people be-
gan to be astonished, seeing there
was “more than one witness who
testified of the things whereof they
were accused, and also of the things
which were to come, according to
the spirit of prophecy which was
in them.

13 Nevertheless, there were some
among them who thought to ques-
tion them, that by their cunning
*devices they might catch them in
their words, that they might °find

witness against them, that they
might deliver them to their judges
that they might be judged accord-
ing to the law, and that they might
be slain or cast into prison, accord-
ing to the crime which they could
make appear or witness against
them.

14 Now it was those men who
sought to destroy them, who were
“lawyers, who were hired or ap-
pointed by the people to adminis-
ter the law at their times of trials,
or at the trials of the crimes of the
people before the judges.

15 Now these lawyers were learned
in all the arts and “cunning of the
people; and this was to enable them
that they might be skilful in their
profession.

16 And it came to pass that they
began to question Amulek, that
thereby they might make him “cross
his words, or contradict the words
which he should speak.

17 Now they knew not that Amu-
lek could “know of their designs.
But it came to pass as they began
to question him, he perceived their
thoughts, and he said unto them: O
ye wicked and perverse ‘generation,
ye lawyers and hypocrites, for ye
are laying the foundations of the
devil; for ye are laying “traps and
snares to catch the holy ones of God.

18 Ye are laying plans to “pervert
the ways of the righteous, and to
bring down the wrath of God upon
your heads, even to the utter de-
struction of this people.

19 Yea, well did Mosiah say, who
was our last king, when he was about
to deliver up the kingdom, having
no one to confer it upon, causing
that this people should be governed

 

ALMA 10:14-25

by their own voices—yea, well did
he say that if the time should come
that the voice of this people should
*choose iniquity, that is, if the time
should come that this people should
fall into transgression, they would
be ripe for destruction.

20 And now I say unto you that
well doth the Lord “judge of your
iniquities; well doth he cry unto this
people, by the voice of his ’angels:
Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom
of heaven is at hand.

21 Yea, well doth he cry, by the
voice of his angels that: “I will come
down among my people, with equity
and justice in my hands.

22 Yea, and I say unto you that if
it were not for the “prayers of the
righteous, who are now in the land,
that ye would even now be visited
with utter destruction; yet it would
not be by *flood, as were the people
in the days of ‘Noah, but it would
be by famine, and by pestilence,
and the ‘sword.

23 But it is by the “prayers of the
righteous that ye are spared; now
therefore, if ye will cast out the
righteous from among you then will
not the Lord stay his hand; but in
his fierce anger he will come out
against you; then ye shall be smit-
ten by famine, and by pestilence,
and by the sword; and the ‘time is
soon at hand except ye repent.

24 And now it came to pass that
the people were more angry with
Amulek, and they cried out, saying:
This man doth revile against our
laws which are just, and our wise
“lawyers whom we have selected.

25 But Amulek stretched forth
his hand, and cried the mightier
unto them, saying: O ye wicked and

perverse generation, why hath Sa-
tan got such great hold upon your
hearts? Why will ye yield yourselves
unto him that he may have power
over you, to “blind your eyes, that
ye will not understand the words
which are spoken, according to
their truth?

26 For behold, have I testified
against your law? Ye do not un-
derstand; ye say that I have spoken
against your law; but I have not,
but I have spoken in favor of your
law, to your condemnation.

27 And now behold, I say unto you,
that the foundation of the ¢destruc-
tion of this people is beginning to
be laid by the unrighteousness of
your ‘lawyers and your judges.

28 And now it came to pass that
when Amulek had spoken these
words the people cried out against
him, saying: Now we know that this
man is a *child of the devil, for he
hath *lied unto us; for he hath spo-
ken against our law. And now he says
that he has not spoken against it.

29 And again, he has reviled
against our lawyers, and our judges.

30 And it came to pass that the
lawyers put it into their hearts that
they should remember these things
against him.

31 And there was one among them
whose name was Zeezrom. Now he
was the foremost to “accuse Amu-
lek and Alma, he being one of the
most expert among them, having
much business to do among the
people.

32 Now the object of these lawyers
was to get gain; and they got gain
“according to their employ.

CHAPTER 11

The Nephite monetary system is set
forth—Amulek contends with Zeez-

 

234

rom—Christ will not save people in their
sins—Only those who inherit the king-
dom of heaven are saved—All men will
rise in immortality—There is no death
after the Resurrection. About 82 B.C.

Now it was in the law of Mosiah that
every man who was a judge of the
law, or those who were appointed
to be judges, should receive “wages
baccording to the time which they
labored to judge those who were
brought before them to be judged.

2 Now if a man owed another, and
he would not “pay that which he
did owe, he was complained of to
the judge; and the judge executed
authority, and sent forth officers
that the man should be brought
before him; and he judged the man
according to the law and the evi-
dences which were brought against
him, and thus the man was com-
pelled to pay that which he owed,
or be stripped, or be cast out from
among the people as a thief and
a robber.

3 And the judge received for his
wages “according to his time—a °se-
nine of gold for a day, or a senum
of silver, which is equal to a senine
of gold; and this is according to the
law which was given.

4 Now these are the names of the
different pieces of their gold, and
of their silver, according to their
value. And the names are given by
the Nephites, for they did not reckon
after the “manner of the Jews who
were at Jerusalem; neither did they
measure after the manner of the
Jews; but they altered their reck-
oning and their measure, according
to the minds and the circumstances
of the people, in every generation,
until the reign of the judges, they
having been "established by king
Mosiah.

5 Now the reckoning is thus—a se-
nine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum
of gold, and a limnah of gold.

6A senum of silver, an amnor of
silver, an ezrom of silver, and an
onti of silver.

7 A senum of silver was equal
to a senine of gold, and either for
a measure of barley, and also fora
measure of every kind of grain.

8 Now the amount of a seon of
gold was twice the value of a senine.

9 And a shum of gold was twice
the value of a seon.

10 And a limnah of gold was the
value of them all.

11 And an amnor of silver was as
great as two senums.

12 And an ezrom of silver was as
great as four senums.

13 And an onti was as great as
them all.

14 Now this is the value of the
lesser numbers of their reckoning—

15 A shiblon is half of a senum;
therefore, a shiblon for half a mea-
sure of barley.

16 And a shiblum is a half of a
shiblon.

17 And a leah is the half of a
shiblum.

18 Now this is their number, ac-
cording to their reckoning.

19 Now an antion of gold is equal
to three shiblons.

20 Now, it was for the sole purpose
to get “gain, because they received
their wages according to their °em-
ploy, therefore, they did ‘stir up the
people to *riotings, and all manner
of disturbances and wickedness,
that they might have more em-
ploy, that they might ‘get ‘money
according to the suits which were
brought before them; therefore they
did stir up the people against Alma
and Amulek.

 

ALMA 11:5-28

21 And this Zeezrom began to
question Amulek, saying: Will ye
answer me a few questions which I
shall ask you? Now Zeezrom was a
man who was “expert in the "devices
of the devil, that he might destroy
that which was good; therefore, he
said unto Amulek: Will ye answer
the questions which I shall put
unto you?

22 And Amulek said unto him:
Yea, if it be according to the “Spirit
of the Lord, which is in me; for I
shall say nothing which is con-
trary to the Spirit of the Lord. And
Zeezrom said unto him: Behold,
here are six onties of silver, and all
these will I °give thee if thou wilt
deny the existence of a Supreme
Being.

23 Now Amulek said: O thou “child
of hell, why *tempt ye me? Knowest
thou that the righteous yieldeth to
no such temptations?

24 Believest thou that there is
no God? I say unto you, Nay, thou
knowest that there is a God, but thou
lovest that “lucre more than him.

25 And now thou hast lied be-
fore God unto me. Thou saidst
unto me—Behold these six onties,
which are of great worth, I will
give unto thee—when thou hadst
it in thy heart to retain them from
me; and it was only thy desire that
I should deny the true and living
God, that thou mightest have cause
to destroy me. And now behold, for
this great evil thou shalt have thy
reward.

26 And Zeezrom said unto him:
Thou sayest there is a true and liv-
ing God?

27 And Amulek said: Yea, there is
a true and living God.

28 Now Zeezrom said: Is there more
than one God?

29 And he answered, No.

30 Now Zeezrom said unto him
again: How knowest thou these
things?

31 And he said: An “angel hath
made them known unto me.

32 And Zeezrom said again: Who
is he that shall come? Is it the Son
of God?

33 And he said unto him, Yea.

34 And Zeezrom said again: Shall
he save his people “in their sins?
And Amulek answered and said
unto him: I say unto you he shall
not, for it is impossible for him to
deny his word.

35 Now Zeezrom said unto the
people: See that ye remember these
things; for he said there is but one
God; yet he saith that the Son of
God shall come, but he shall “not
save his people—as though he had
authority to command God.

36 Now Amulek saith again unto
him: Behold thou hast “lied, for
thou sayest that I spake as though
I had authority to command God
because I said he shall not save his
people in their sins.

37 And I say unto you again that
he cannot save them in their “sins;
for I cannot deny his word, and he
hath said that "no unclean thing
can inherit the “kingdom of heaven;
therefore, how can ye be saved,
except ye inherit the kingdom of
heaven? Therefore, ye cannot be
saved in your sins.

38 Now Zeezrom saith again unto
him: Is the Son of God the very
Eternal Father?

39 And Amulek said unto him:
Yea, he is the very “Eternal Father

 

236

of heaven and of earth, and ’all
things which in them are; he is the
beginning and the end, the first
and the last;

40 And he shall come into the
“world to "redeem his people; and
he shall ‘take upon him the trans-
gressions of those who believe on
his name; and these are they that
shall have eternal life, and salva-
tion cometh to none else.

41 Therefore the wicked remain as
though there had been “no redemp-
tion made, except it be the loosing
of the bands of death; for behold,
the day cometh that "all shall rise
from the dead and stand before
God, and be ‘judged according to
their works.

42 Now, there is a death which
is called a temporal death; and
the death of Christ shall loose the
“bands of this temporal death, that
all shall be raised from this temporal
death.

43 The spirit and the body shall
be “reunited again in its °perfect
form; both limb and joint shall be
restored to its proper frame, even
as we now are at this time; and we
shall be brought to stand before
God, ‘knowing even as we know
now, and have a bright 4recollec-
tion of all our “guilt.

44 Now, this restoration shall
come to all, both old and young,
both bond and free, both male and
female, both the wicked and the
righteous; and even there shall not
so much as a hair of their heads be
lost; but every thing shall be ¢re-
stored to its perfect frame, as it is
now, or in the body, and shall be

tal body is ‘raised to an “immortal
body, that is from death, even from
the first death unto life, that they
can “die no more; their spirits unit-
ing with their bodies, never to be
divided; thus the whole becoming
{spiritual and immortal, that they
can no more see corruption.

46 Now, when Amulek had finished
these words the people began again
to be astonished, and also Zeezrom
began to tremble. And thus ended
the words of Amulek, or this is all
that I have written.

CHAPTER 12

Alma speaks to Zeezrom—tThe mysteries
of God can be given only to the faith-
ful—Men are judged by their thoughts,
beliefs, words, and works—The wicked
will suffer a spiritual death—This mor-
tal life is a probationary state—The
plan of redemption brings to pass the
Resurrection and, through faith, a re-
mission of sins—The repentant have a
claim on mercy through the Only Be-
gotten Son. About 82 B.c.

Now Alma, seeing that the words of
Amulek had silenced Zeezrom, for
he beheld that Amulek had caught
him in his “lying and deceiving to de-
stroy him, and seeing that he began
to tremble under a “consciousness

 

ALMA 11:45-12:7

of his guilt, he opened his mouth
and began to speak unto him, and
to establish the words of Amulek,
and to explain things beyond, or to
unfold the scriptures beyond that
which Amulek had done.

2 Now the words that Alma spake
unto Zeezrom were heard by the
people round about; for the mul-
titude was great, and he spake on
this wise:

3 Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou
hast been taken in thy lying and
craftiness, for thou hast not lied
unto men only but thou hast lied
unto God; for behold, he knows all
thy “thoughts, and thou seest that
thy thoughts are made known unto
us by his Spirit;

4 And thou seest that we know
that thy plan was a very “subtle
plan, as to the subtlety of the devil,
for to lie and to deceive this peo-
ple that thou mightest set them
against us, to ’revile us and to cast
us out—

5 Now this was a plan of thine “ad-
versary, and he hath exercised his
power in thee. Now I would that ye
should remember that what I say
unto thee I say unto all.

6 And behold I say unto you all
that this was a “snare of the adver-
sary, which he has laid to catch
this people, that he might bring
you into subjection unto him, that
he might encircle you about with
his "chains, that he might chain
you down to everlasting destruc-
tion, according to the power of his
captivity.

7 Now when Alma had spoken
these words, Zeezrom began to
tremble more exceedingly, for he
was convinced more and more of
the power of God; and he was also

convinced that Alma and Amulek
had a knowledge of him, for he
was convinced that they ¢knew the
thoughts and intents of his heart;
for power was given unto them that
they might know of these things
according to the spirit of prophecy.

8 And Zeezrom began to inquire
of them diligently, that he might
know more concerning the king-
dom of God. And he said unto
Alma: What does this mean which
Amulek hath spoken concerning
the resurrection of the dead, that
all shall rise from the dead, both
the “just and the unjust, and are
brought to stand before God to be
>judged according to their works?

9 And now Alma began to expound
these things unto him, saying: It
is given unto many to “know the
b’mysteries of God; nevertheless
they are laid under a strict com-
mand that they shall not impart
‘only according to the portion of his
word which he doth grant unto the
children of men, according to the
heed and diligence which they give
unto him.

10 And therefore, he that will
“harden his heart, the same receiv-
eth the "lesser portion of the word;
and he that will ‘not harden his
heart, to him is “given the greater
portion of the word, until it is given
unto him to know the mysteries of
God until he know them in full.

11 And they that will harden their
hearts, to them is given the lesser
“portion of the word until they "know
nothing concerning his mysteries;

 

238

and then they are taken captive by
the devil, and led by his will down
to destruction. Now this is what is
meant by the ‘chains of “hell.

12 And Amulek hath spoken
plainly concerning “death, and
being raised from this mortality to
a state of immortality, and being
brought before the bar of God, to
be "judged according to our works.

13 Then if our hearts have been
hardened, yea, if we have hardened
our hearts against the word, inso-
much that it has not been found in
us, then will our state be awful, for
then we shall be condemned.

14 For our “words will condemn us,
yea, all our works will condemn
us; we shall not be found spotless;
and our thoughts will also condemn
us; and in this awful state we shall
not dare to look up to our God;
and we would fain be glad if we
could command the rocks and the
’mountains to fall upon us to “hide
us from his presence.

15 But this cannot be; we must
come forth and stand before him
in his glory, and in his power, and in
his might, majesty, and dominion,
and acknowledge to our everlasting
“shame that all his "judgments are
just; that he is just in all his works,
and that he is merciful unto the
children of men, and that he has
all power to save every man that
believeth on his name and bringeth
forth fruit meet for repentance.

16 And now behold, I say unto you
then cometh a death, even a second
*death, which is a spiritual death;

then is a time that whosoever dieth
in his sins, as to a temporal *death,
shall also ‘die a spiritual death; yea,
he shall die as to things pertaining
unto righteousness.

17 Then is the time when their
torments shall be as a “lake of fire
and brimstone, whose flame as-
cendeth up forever and ever; and
then is the time that they shall be
chained down to an everlasting de-
struction, according to the power
and captivity of Satan, he having
subjected them according to his will.

18 Then, I say unto you, they shall
be as though there had been “no re-
demption made; for they cannot be
redeemed according to God’s justice;
and they cannot "die, seeing there
is no more corruption.

19 Now it came to pass that when
Alma had made an end of speaking
these words, the people began to be
more astonished;

20 But there was one Antionah,
who was a chief ruler among them,
came forth and said unto him: What
is this that thou hast said, that man
should rise from the dead and be
changed from this mortal to an
“immortal state, that the soul can
never die?

21 What does the scripture mean,
which saith that God placed “cheru-
bim and a flaming sword on the
east of the garden of "Eden, lest our
first parents should enter and par-
take of the fruit of the tree of life,
and live forever? And thus we see
that there was no possible chance
that they should live forever.

22 Now Alma said unto him: This

 

ALMA 12:17-26

is the thing which I was about to
explain. Now we see that Adam
did “fall by the partaking of the
forbidden "fruit, according to the
word of God; and thus we see, that
by his fall, all mankind became a
‘lost and fallen people.

23 And now behold, I say unto
you that if it had been possible for
Adam to have “partaken of the fruit
of the tree of life at that time, there
would have been no death, and the
word would have been void, mak-
ing God a liar, for he said: "If thou
eat thou shalt surely die.

24 And we see that “death comes
upon mankind, yea, the death which
has been spoken of by Amulek,
which is the temporal death; nev-
ertheless there was a space granted
unto ’man in which he might repent;
therefore this life became a ‘pro-
bationary state; a time to “prepare
to meet God; a time to prepare for
that endless state which has been
spoken of by us, which is after the
resurrection of the dead.

25 Now, if it had not been for the
plan of redemption, which was laid
from the foundation of the world,
there could have been no “resur-
rection of the dead; but there was
a plan of redemption laid, which
shall bring to pass the resurrec-
tion of the dead, of which has been
spoken.

26 And now behold, if it were pos-
sible that our first parents could
have gone forth and partaken of the
“tree of life they would have been
forever miserable, having no pre-
paratory state; and thus the ’plan

of redemption would have been frus-
trated, and the word of God would
have been void, taking none effect.

27 But behold, it was not so; but
it was “appointed unto men that
they must die; and after death, they
must come to "judgment, even that
same judgment of which we have
spoken, which is the end.

28 And after God had appointed
that these things should come unto
man, behold, then he saw that it
was expedient that man should
know concerning the things whereof
he had appointed unto them;

29 Therefore he sent “angels to
converse with them, who caused
men to behold of his glory.

30 And they began from that time
forth to call on his name; therefore
God “conversed with men, and made
known unto them the "plan of re-
demption, which had been prepared
from the ‘foundation of the world;
and this he made known unto them
according to their faith and repen-
tance and their “holy works.

31 Wherefore, he gave ¢command-
ments unto men, they having first
transgressed the first command-
ments as to things which were
temporal, and becoming as gods,
‘knowing good from evil, placing
themselves in a state to “act, or being
placed in a state to act according to
their wills and pleasures, whether
to do evil or to do good—

32 Therefore God gave unto them
commandments, after having made
“known unto them the plan of re-
demption, that they should not do

 

240

evil, the penalty thereof being a
second ’death, which was an ever-
lasting ‘death as to things pertain-
ing unto righteousness; for on such
the plan of redemption could have
no power, for the works of “justice
could not be destroyed, according
to the supreme “goodness of God.

33 But God did call on men, in
the name of his Son, (this being
the “plan of redemption which was
laid) saying: If ye will *repent, and
harden not your hearts, then will
I have mercy upon you, through
mine Only Begotten Son;

34 Therefore, whosoever repenteth,
and hardeneth not his heart, he shall
have claim on “mercy through mine
Only Begotten Son, unto a ’remis-
sion of his sins; and these shall en-
ter into my ‘rest.

35 And whosoever will harden his
heart and will do “iniquity, behold,
I swear in my wrath that he shall
not enter into my rest.

36 And now, my brethren, be-
hold I say unto you, that if ye will
harden your hearts ye shall not en-
ter into the rest of the Lord; there-
fore your iniquity *provoketh him
that he sendeth down his wrath
upon you as in the ‘first provoca-
tion, yea, according to his word in
the last provocation as well as the
first, to the everlasting ‘destruction
of your souls; therefore, according
to his word, unto the last death, as
well as the first.

37 And now, my brethren, seeing
we know these things, and they are
true, let us repent, and harden not

our hearts, that we “provoke not
the Lord our God to pull down his
wrath upon us in these his second
commandments which he has given
unto us; but let us enter into the

cording to his word.

CHAPTER 13

Men are called as high priests because
of their exceeding faith and good works—
They are to teach the commandments—
Through righteousness they are sanctified
and enter into the rest of the Lord—Mel-
chizedek was one of these—Angels are
declaring glad tidings throughout the
land—They will declare the actual com-
ing of Christ. About 82 B.c.

AND again, my brethren, I would
cite your minds forward to the time
when the Lord God gave these com-
mandments unto his children; and
I would that ye should remember
that the Lord God “ordained priests,
after his holy order, which was after
the order of his Son, to teach these
things unto the people.

2 And those priests were ordained
after the “order of his Son, in a
b’manner that thereby the people
might know in what manner to look
forward to his Son for redemption.

3 And this is the manner after
which they were ordained—being
“called and "prepared from the
‘foundation of the world according
to the “foreknowledge of God, on ac-
count of their exceeding faith and
good works; in the first place being
left to “choose good or evil; there-
fore they having chosen good, and

 

ALMA 13:1-8

exercising exceedingly great ‘faith,
are ‘called witha holy calling, yea,
with that holy calling which was
prepared with, and according to,a
preparatory redemption for such.

4 And thus they have been “called
to this holy calling on account of
their faith, while others would re-
ject the Spirit of God on account
of the hardness of their hearts and
’blindness of their minds, while, if
it had not been for this they might
have had as great ‘privilege as their
brethren.

5 Or in fine, in the first place they
were on the “same standing with
their brethren; thus this holy calling
being prepared from the foundation
of the world for such as would not
harden their hearts, being in and
through the atonement of the Only
Begotten Son, who was prepared—

6 And thus being called by this
holy calling, and ordained unto the
high priesthood of the holy order of
God, to teach his commandments
unto the children of men, that they
also might enter into his *rest—

7 This high priesthood being after
the order of his Son, which order was
from the foundation of the world;
or in other words, being *without
beginning of days or end of years,
being prepared from ’eternity to
all eternity, according to his ‘fore-
knowledge of all things—

8 Now they were “ordained after
this manner—being called with
a holy calling, and ordained witha
holy ordinance, and taking upon
them the high priesthood of the holy
order, which calling, and ordinance,

and high priesthood, is without
beginning or end—

9 Thus they become “high priests
forever, after the order of the Son,
the Only Begotten of the Father, who
is without beginning of days or end
of years, who is full of 'grace, equity,
and truth. And thus it is. Amen.

10 Now, as I said concerning the
holy order, or this “high priest-
hood, there were many who were
ordained and became high priests of
God; and it was on account of their
exceeding faith and ‘repentance,
and their righteousness before God,
they choosing to repent and work
righteousness rather than to perish;

11 Therefore they were called af-
ter this holy order, and were “sanc-
tified, and their "garments were
washed white through the blood
of the Lamb.

12 Now they, after being “sanc-
tified by the "Holy Ghost, having
their garments made white, being
“pure and spotless before God, could
not look upon “sin save it were with
“abhorrence; and there were many,
exceedingly great many, who were
made pure and entered into the rest
of the Lord their God.

13 And now, my brethren, I would
that ye should humble yourselves
before God, and bring forth “fruit
meet for repentance, that ye may
also enter into that rest.

14 Yea, humble yourselves even as
the people in the days of *Melchi-
zedek, who was also a high priest
after this same order which I have

 

242

spoken, who also took upon him
the high priesthood forever.

15 And it was this same Melchizedek
to whom Abraham paid “tithes; yea,
even our father Abraham paid tithes
of one-tenth part of all he possessed.

16 Now these “ordinances were
given after this "manner, that there-
by the people might look forward
on the Son of God, it being a ‘type
of his order, or it being his order,
and this that they might look for-
ward to him for a remission of their
sins, that they might enter into the
rest of the Lord.

17 Now this Melchizedek was a
king over the land of Salem; and
his people had waxed strong in in-
iquity and abomination; yea, they
had all gone astray; they were full
of all manner of wickedness;

18 But Melchizedek having exer-
cised mighty faith, and received the
office of the high priesthood accord-
ing to the “holy order of God, did
preach repentance unto his people.
And behold, they did repent; and
Melchizedek did establish peace in
the land in his days; therefore he
was called the prince of peace, for
he was the king of Salem; and he
did reign under his father.

19 Now, there were “many before
him, and also there were many af-
terwards, but *none were greater;
therefore, of him they have more
particularly made mention.

20 Now I need not rehearse the
matter; what I have said may suf-
fice. Behold, the “scriptures are

before you; if ye will "wrest them
it shall be to your own destruction.

21 And now it came to pass that
when Alma had said these words
unto them, he stretched forth his
hand unto them and cried with a
mighty voice, saying: “Now is the
time to repent, for the day of sal-
vation draweth nigh;

22 Yea, and the voice of the Lord,
by the ¢“mouth of angels, doth de-
clare it unto all nations; yea, doth
declare it, that they may have glad
tidings of great joy; yea, and he doth
sound these glad tidings among all
his people, yea, even to them that
are scattered abroad upon the face
of the earth; wherefore they have
come unto us.

23 And they are made known unto
us in“plain terms, that we may un-
derstand, that we cannot err; and
this because of our being °wander-
ers in a strange land; therefore, we
are thus highly favored, for we have
these glad tidings declared unto us
in all parts of our vineyard.

24 For behold, “angels are declar-
ing it unto many at this time in our
land; and this is for the purpose of
preparing the hearts of the children
of men to receive his word at the
time of his coming in his glory.

25 And now we only wait to hear
the joyful news declared unto us
by the mouth of angels, of his com-
ing; for the time cometh, we “know
not how soon. Would to God that
it might be in my day; but let it be
sooner or later, in it I will rejoice.

26 And it shall be made known unto
“just and holy men, by the mouth
of angels, at the time of his coming,

 

ALMA 13:21-31

that the words of our fathers may
be fulfilled, according to that which
they have spoken concerning him,
which was according to the spirit
of prophecy which was in them.

27 And now, my brethren, I “wish
from the inmost part of my heart,
yea, with great ’anxiety even unto
pain, that ye would hearken unto
my words, and cast off your sins,
and not ‘procrastinate the day of
your repentance;

28 But that ye would humble
yourselves before the Lord, and
call on his holy name, and “watch
and pray continually, that ye may
not be *tempted above that which
ye can bear, and thus be ‘led by
the Holy Spirit, becoming humble,
4meek, submissive, patient, full of
love and all long-suffering;

29 “Having faith on the Lord; hav-
ing a hope that ye shall receive
eternal life; having the "love of God
always in your hearts, that ye may
be lifted up at the last day and en-
ter into his ‘rest.

30 And may the Lord grant unto
you repentance, that ye may not
bring down his wrath upon you,
that ye may not be “bound down
by the chains of "hell, that ye may
not suffer the second ‘death.

31 And Alma spake many more
words unto the people, which are
not written in “this book.

in glory—The prison walls are rent and
fail—Alma and Amulek are delivered,
and their persecutors are slain. About
82-81 B.c.

AND it came to pass after he had
made an end of speaking unto the
people many of them did believe
on his words, and began to repent,
and to search the “scriptures.

2 But the more part of them were
desirous that they might destroy
Alma and Amulek; for they were
angry with Alma, because of the
*plainness of his words unto Zeez-
rom; and they also said that Amu-
lek had *lied unto them, and had
reviled against their law and also
against their lawyers and judges.

3 And they were also angry with
Alma and Amulek; and because
they had “testified so plainly against
their wickedness, they sought to
’nut them away privily.

4 But it came to pass that they
did not; but they took them and
bound them with strong cords, and
took them before the chief judge
of the land.

5 And the people went forth and
witnessed against them—testifying
that they had reviled against the
law, and their lawyers and judges of
the land, and also of all the people
that were in the land; and also testi-
fied that there was but one God, and
that he should send his Son among
the people, but he should “not save
them; and many such things did
the people testify against Alma and
Amulek. Now this was done before
the chief judge of the land.

6 And it came to pass that Zeez-
rom was astonished at the words
which had been spoken; and he also
knew concerning the “blindness of
the minds, which he had caused
among the people by his *lying

 

244

words; and his soul began to be
charrowed up under a “conscious-
ness of his own guilt; yea, he began
to be encircled about by the pains
of hell.

7 And it came to pass that he be-
gan to cry unto the people, saying:
Behold, Lam “guilty, and these men
are spotless before God. And he
began to plead for them from that
time forth; but they reviled him,
saying: Art thou also possessed with
the devil? And they spit upon him,
and °cast him out from among them,
and also all those who believed in
the words which had been spoken
by Alma and Amulek; and they
cast them out, and sent men to cast
stones at them.

8 And they brought their wives
and children together, and whoso-
ever believed or had been taught
to believe in the word of God they
caused that they should be “cast
into the fire; and they also brought
forth their records which contained
the holy scriptures, and cast them
into the fire also, that they might
be "burned and destroyed by fire.

9 And it came to pass that they
took Alma and Amulek, and carried
them forth to the place of ¢*martyr-
dom, that they might witness the
destruction of those who were con-
sumed by fire.

10 And when Amulek saw the
pains of the women and children
who were consuming in the fire, he
also was pained; and he said unto
Alma: How can we witness this aw-
ful scene? Therefore let us stretch
forth our hands, and exercise the
“power of God which is in us, and
save them from the flames.

11 But Alma said unto him: The
Spirit constraineth me that I must
not stretch forth mine hand; for
behold the Lord receiveth them up

unto himself, in “glory; and he doth
suffer that they may do this thing,
or that the people may do this thing
unto them, according to the hard-
ness of their hearts, that the "judg-
ments which he shall exercise upon
them in his wrath may be just; and
the ‘blood of the 4innocent shall
stand as a witness against them,
yea, and cry mightily against them
at the last day.

12 Now Amulek said unto Alma:
Behold, perhaps they will burn us
also.

13 And Alma said: Be it according
to the will of the Lord. But, behold,
our work is not finished; therefore
they burn us not.

14 Now it came to pass that when
the bodies of those who had been
cast into the fire were consumed,
and also the records which were cast
in with them, the chief judge of the
land came and stood before Alma
and Amulek, as they were bound;
and he smote them with his hand
upon their ¢cheeks, and said unto
them: After what ye have seen, will
ye preach again unto this people,
that they shall be cast into a "lake
of fire and brimstone?

15 Behold, ye see that ye had not
power to save those who had been
cast into the fire; neither has God
saved them because they were of
thy faith. And the judge smote them
again upon their cheeks, and asked:
What say ye for yourselves?

16 Now this judge was after the
order and faith of *Nehor, who slew
Gideon.

17 And it came to pass that Alma
and Amulek answered him “noth-
ing; and he smote them again, and
delivered them to the officers to be
’cast into prison.

18 And when they had been cast

 

ALMA 14:12-23

into prison three days, there came
many “lawyers, and judges, and
priests, and teachers, who were of
the profession of Nehor; and they
came in unto the prison to see them,
and they questioned them about
many words; but they answered
them nothing.

19 And it came to pass that the
judge stood before them, and said:
Why do ye not answer the words
of this people? Know ye not that I
have “power to deliver you up unto
the flames? And he "commanded
them to speak; but they answered
nothing.

20 And it came to pass that they
departed and went their ways, but
came again on the morrow; and
the judge also smote them again
on their cheeks. And many came
forth also, and smote them, saying:
Will ye stand again and judge this
people, and condemn our law? If
ye have such great power why do
ye not “deliver yourselves?

21 And many such things did they
say unto them, gnashing their teeth
upon them, and spitting upon them,
and saying: How shall we look when
we are damned?

22 And many such things, yea, all
manner of such things did they say
unto them; and thus they did “mock
them for many days. And they
did withhold food from them that
they might hunger, and water
that they might thirst; and they also
did take from them their clothes
that they were naked; and thus they
were "bound with strong cords, and
confined in ‘prison.

23 And it came to pass after they
had thus suffered for many days,
(and it was on the twelfth day, in
the tenth month, in the tenth year
of the reign of the judges over the

people of Nephi) that the chief
judge over the land of 7Ammoni-
hah and many of their teachers
and their lawyers went in unto the
prison where Alma and Amulek
were bound with cords.

24 And the chief judge stood be-
fore them, and smote them again,
and said unto them: If ye have the
“power of God deliver yourselves
from these bands, and then we will
believe that the Lord will destroy
this people according to your words.

25 And it came to pass that they all
went forth and smote them, saying
the same words, even until the last;
and when the last had spoken unto
them the “power of God was upon
Alma and Amulek, and they rose
and stood upon their feet.

26 And Alma cried, saying: How
long shall we suffer these great
“afflictions, O Lord? O Lord, ’give
us strength according to our faith
which is in Christ, even unto ‘de-
liverance. And they broke the cords
with which they were bound; and
when the people saw this, they be-
gan to flee, for the fear of destruc-
tion had come upon them.

27 And it came to pass that so great
was their fear that they fell to the
earth, and did not obtain the outer
door of the “prison; and the earth
shook mightily, and the walls of
the prison were rent in twain, so
that they fell to the earth; and the
chief judge, and the lawyers, and
priests, and teachers, who smote
upon Alma and Amulek, were slain
by the fall thereof.

28 And Alma and Amulek came
forth out of the prison, and they
were not hurt; for the Lord had
granted unto them “power, accord-
ing to their faith which was in Christ.

 

246

And they straightway came forth
out of the prison; and they were
’loosed from their “bands; and the
prison had fallen to the earth, and
every soul within the walls thereof,
save it were Alma and Amulek, was
slain; and they straightway came
forth into the city.

29 Now the people having heard a
great noise came running together by
multitudes to know the cause of it;
and when they saw Alma and Amu-
lek coming forth out of the prison,
and the walls thereof had fallen to
the earth, they were struck with
great fear, and fled from the pres-
ence of Alma and Amulek even as a
goat fleeth with her young from two
lions; and thus they did flee from
the presence of Alma and Amulek.

AND it came to pass that Alma and
Amulek were commanded to depart
out of that city; and they departed,
and came out even into the land of
Sidom; and behold, there they found
all the people who had departed out
of the land of 7Ammonihah, who had
been ’cast out and stoned, because
they believed in the words of Alma.

2 And they related unto them all
that had happened unto their “wives
and children, and also concerning
themselves, and of their "power of
deliverance.

of his mind on account of his @wick-
edness, for he supposed that Alma
and Amulek were no more; and he
supposed that they had been slain
because of his iniquity. And this
great sin, and his many other sins,
did harrow up his mind until it did
become exceedingly sore, having no
deliverance; therefore he began to
be scorched with a burning heat.

4 Now, when he heard that Alma
and Amulek were in the land of Si-
dom, his heart began to take courage;
and he sent a message immediately
unto them, desiring them to come
unto him.

5 And it came to pass that they
went immediately, obeying the mes-
sage which he had sent unto them;
and they went in unto the house
unto Zeezrom; and they found him
upon his bed, sick, being very low
with a burning fever; and his mind
also was “exceedingly sore because
of his iniquities; and when he saw
them he stretched forth his hand,
and besought them that they would
heal him.

6 And it came to pass that Alma
said unto him, taking him by the
hand: “*Believest thou in the power
of Christ unto salvation?

7 And he answered and said: Yea,
I believe all the words that thou
hast taught.

8 And Alma said: If thou believest
in the redemption of Christ thou
canst be “healed.

9 And he said: Yea, I believe ac-
cording to thy words.

10 And then Alma cried unto the
Lord, saying: O Lord our God, have
“mercy on this man, and "heal him
according to his faith which is in
Christ.

11 And when Alma had said these
words, *Zeezrom leaped upon his

 

ALMA 15:4-17

feet, and began to walk; and this was
done to the great astonishment of
all the people; and the knowledge
of this went forth throughout all the
land of Sidom.

12 And Alma baptized Zeezrom
unto the Lord; and he began from
that time forth to preach unto the
people.

13 And Alma established a church
in the land of Sidom, and conse-
crated “priests and "teachers in the
land, to baptize unto the Lord who-
soever were desirous to be baptized.

14 And it came to pass that they
were many; for they did flock in
from all the region round about
Sidom, and were baptized.

15 But as to the people that were
in the land of Ammonihah, they yet
remained a hard-hearted and a stiff-
necked people; and they repented
not of their sins, “ascribing all the
power of Alma and Amulek to the
devil; for they were of the profes-
sion of "Nehor, and did not believe
in the repentance of their sins.

16 And it came to pass that Alma
and Amulek, Amulek having @for-
saken all his gold, and silver, and
his precious things, which were in
the land of Ammonihah, for the
word of God, he being ’rejected by
those who were once his friends and
also by his father and his kindred;

17 Therefore, after Alma having
established the church at Sidom,
seeing a great “check, yea, seeing
that the people were checked as to
the pride of their hearts, and began
to "humble themselves before God,
and began to assemble themselves
together at their “sanctuaries to “wor-
ship God before the “altar, watching
and praying continually, that they
might be delivered from Satan, and
from death, and from destruction—

18 Now as I said, Alma having
seen all these things, therefore he
took Amulek and came over to the
land of Zarahemla, and took him
to his “own house, and did admin-
ister unto him in his tribulations,
and ’strengthened him in the Lord.

19 And thus ended the tenth year
of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

CHAPTER 16

The Lamanites destroy the people of
Ammonihah—Zoram leads the Nephites
to victory over the Lamanites—Alma
and Amulek and many others preach
the word—They teach that after His
Resurrection Christ will appear to the
Nephites. About 81-77 B.c.

AND it came to pass in the eleventh
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi, on the fifth day
of the second month, there having
been much peace in the land of
Zarahemla, there having been no
wars nor contentions for a certain
number of years, even until the
fifth day of the second month in
the eleventh year, there was a cry
of war heard throughout the land.

2 For behold, the armies of the
Lamanites had come in upon the
wilderness side, into the borders
of the land, even into the city of
¢Ammonihah, and began to slay the
people and destroy the city.

3 And now it came to pass, before
the Nephites could raise a sufficient
army to drive them out of the land,
they had “destroyed the people who
were in the city of Ammonihah,
and also some around the borders
of Noah, and taken others captive
into the wilderness.

4 Now it came to pass that the
Nephites were desirous to obtain
those who had been carried away
captive into the wilderness.

 

248

5 Therefore, he that had been
appointed chief captain over the
armies of the Nephites, (and his
name was Zoram, and he had two
sons, Lehi and Aha)—now Zoram
and his two sons, Knowing that Alma
was high priest over the church,
and having heard that he had the
spirit of prophecy, therefore they
went unto him and desired of him
to Know whither the Lord would
that they should go into the wil-
derness in search of their brethren,
who had been taken captive by the
Lamanites.

6 And it came to pass that Alma
“inquired of the Lord concerning
the matter, And Alma returned
and said unto them: Behold, the
Lamanites will cross the river Sidon
in the south wilderness, away up
beyond the borders of the land of
’Manti. And behold there shall ye
meet them, on the east of the river
Sidon, and there the Lord will de-
liver unto thee thy brethren who
have been taken captive by the
Lamanites.

7 And it came to pass that Zoram
and his sons crossed over the river Si-
don, with their armies, and marched
away beyond the borders of Manti
into the south wilderness, which was
on the east side of the river Sidon.

8 And they came upon the armies
of the Lamanites, and the Laman-
ites were scattered and driven into
the wilderness; and they took their
brethren who had been taken cap-
tive by the Lamanites, and there was
not one soul of them had been lost
that were taken captive. And they
were brought by their brethren to
possess their own lands.

9 And thus ended the eleventh
year of the judges, the Lamanites
having been driven out of the land,
and the people of Ammonihah were
“destroyed; yea, "every living soul

of the Ammonihahites was ‘de-
stroyed, and also their “great city,
which they said God could not de-
stroy, because of its greatness.

10 But behold, in “one day it was
left desolate; and the *carcasses were
mangled by dogs and wild beasts
of the wilderness.

11 Nevertheless, after many days
their “dead bodies were heaped
up upon the face of the earth, and
they were covered with a shallow
covering. And now so great was
the scent thereof that the people
did not go in to possess the land of
Ammonihah for many years. And
it was called Desolation of "Nehors;
for they were of the profession of
Nehor, who were slain; and their
lands remained desolate.

12 And the Lamanites did not come
again to war against the Nephites
until the fourteenth year of the
reign of the judges over the people
of Nephi. And thus for three years
did the people of Nephi have con-
tinual peace in all the land.

13 And Alma and Amulek went
forth preaching repentance to the
people in their “temples, and in
their "sanctuaries, and also in their
“synagogues, which were built after
the manner of the Jews.

14 And as many as would hear
their words, unto them they did
impart the word of God, without
any “respect of persons, continually.

15 And thus did Alma and Amulek
go forth, and also many more who
had been chosen for the work, to
preach the word throughout all the
land. And the establishment of the
church became general throughout

 

ALMA 16:10-21

the land, in all the region round
about, among all the people of the
Nephites.

16 And there was “no inequality
among them; the Lord did pour out
his Spirit on all the face of the land
to prepare the minds of the children
of men, or to prepare their "hearts
to receive the word which should
be taught among them at the time
of his coming—

17 That they might not be hard-
ened against the word, that they
might not be unbelieving, and go on
to destruction, but that they might
receive the word with joy, and as
a “branch be grafted into the true
vine, that they might enter into the
’rest of the Lord their God.

18 Now those “priests who did go
forth among the people did preach
against all "lyings, and ‘deceivings,
and “envyings, and “strifes, and
malice, and revilings, and stealing,
robbing, plundering, murdering,
committing adultery, and all man-
ner of lasciviousness, crying that
these things ought not so to be—

19 Holding forth things which
must shortly come; yea, holding
forth the “coming of the Son of God,
his sufferings and death, and also
the resurrection of the dead.

20 And many of the people did in-
quire concerning the place where
the Son of God should come; and
they were taught that he would
“appear unto them "after his res-
urrection; and this the people did
hear with great joy and gladness.

21 And now after the church had
been established throughout all the
land—having got the “victory over

the devil, and the word of God be-
ing preached in its purity in all the
land, and the Lord pouring out his
blessings upon the people—thus
ended the fourteenth year of the
reign of the judges over the people of
Nephi.

An account of the sons of Mosiah,
who rejected their rights to the king-
dom for the word of God, and went
up to the land of Nephi to preach
to the Lamanites; their sufferings
and deliverance—according to the
record of Alma.

Comprising chapters 17 through 27.

CHAPTER 17

The sons of Mosiah have the spirit of
prophecy and of revelation—They go
their several ways to declare the word
to the Lamanites—Ammon goes to the
land of Ishmael and becomes the ser-
vant of King Lamoni—Ammon saves
the king’s flocks and slays his enemies
at the water of Sebus. Verses 1-3, about
77 B.C; verse 4, about 91-77 B.c.; and
verses 5-39, about 91 B.c.

AND now it came to pass that as
Alma was journeying from the land
of Gideon southward, away to the
land of *Manti, behold, to his as-
tonishment, he "met with the ‘sons
of Mosiah journeying towards the
land of Zarahemla.

2 Now these sons of Mosiah were
with Alma at the time the angel
“first appeared unto him; therefore
Alma did rejoice exceedingly to
see his brethren; and what added
more to his joy, they were still his
brethren in the Lord; yea, and they
had waxed strong in the knowledge
of the truth; for they were men of

 

250

a sound understanding and they
had ’searched the scriptures dili-
gently, that they might know the
word of God.

3 But this is not all; they had
given themselves to much prayer,
and “fasting; therefore they had the
spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of
revelation, and when they taught,
they taught with "power and au-
thority of God.

4 And they had been teaching the
word of God for the space of fourteen
years among the Lamanites, having
had much “success in bringing many
to the ’knowledge of the truth; yea,
by the power of their words many
were brought before the altar of God,
to call on his name and ‘confess
their sins before him.

5 Now these are the circumstances
which attended them in their jour-
neyings, for they had many afflic-
tions; they did suffer much, both in
body and in mind, such as hunger,
thirst and fatigue, and also much
“labor in the spirit.

6 Now these were their journey-
ings: Having “taken leave of their
father, Mosiah, in the ’first year of
the judges; having ‘refused the king-
dom which their father was desir-
ous to confer upon them, and also
this was the minds of the people;

7 Nevertheless they departed out
of the land of Zarahemla, and took
their swords, and their spears,
and their bows, and their arrows,
and their slings; and this they did
that they might “provide food for
themselves while in the wilderness.

8 And thus they departed into
the wilderness with their numbers
which they had “selected, to go up
to the land of Nephi, to preach the
word of God unto the Lamanites.

9 And it came to pass that they

journeyed many days in the wil-
derness, and they fasted much and
“prayed much that the Lord would
grant unto them a portion of his
Spirit to go with them, and abide
with them, that they might be an
‘instrument in the hands of God to
bring, if it were possible, their breth-
ren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge
of the truth, to the knowledge of the
baseness of the ‘traditions of their
fathers, which were not correct.

10 And it came to pass that the
Lord did “visit them with his ’Spirit,
and said unto them: Be ‘comforted.
And they were comforted.

11 And the Lord said unto them
also: Go forth among the Laman-
ites, thy brethren, and establish
my word; yet ye shall be “patient in
long-suffering and afflictions, that
ye may show forth good "examples
unto them in me, and I will make
an instrument of thee in my hands
unto the salvation of many souls.

12 And it came to pass that the hearts
of the sons of Mosiah, and also those
who were with them, took courage
to go forth unto the Lamanites to
declare unto them the word of God.

13 And it came to pass when they
had arrived in the borders of the
land of the Lamanites, that they
“separated themselves and departed
one from another, trusting in the
Lord that they should meet again
at the close of their "harvest; for
they supposed that great was the
work which they had undertaken.

14 And assuredly it was great,
for they had undertaken to preach
the word of God to a *wild and a
hardened and a ferocious people;
a people who delighted in murder-
ing the Nephites, and robbing and
plundering them; and their hearts
were set upon riches, or upon gold

 

ALMA 17:10-20

and silver, and precious stones; yet
they sought to obtain these things
by murdering and plundering, that
they might not labor for them with
their own hands.

15 Thus they were a very indolent
people, many of whom did worship
idols, and the “curse of God had
fallen upon them because of the
’traditions of their fathers; notwith-
standing the promises of the Lord
were extended unto them on the
conditions of repentance.

16 Therefore, this was the “cause
for which the sons of Mosiah had
undertaken the work, that perhaps
they might bring them unto re-
pentance; that perhaps they might
bring them to know of the plan of
redemption.

17 Therefore they separated them-
selves one from another, and went
forth among them, every man alone,
according to the word and power
of God which was given unto him.

18 Now Ammon being the chief
among them, or rather he did ad-
minister unto them, and he departed
from them, after having “blessed
them according to their several
stations, having imparted the word
of God unto them, or administered
unto them before his departure; and
thus they took their several jour-
neys throughout the land.

19 And Ammon went to the land
of “Ishmael, the land being called
after the sons of "Ishmael, who also
became Lamanites.

20 And as Ammon entered the land
of Ishmael, the Lamanites took him
and “bound him, as was their cus-
tom to bind all the Nephites who
fell into their hands, and carry them
before the king; and thus it was left
to the pleasure of the king to slay
them, or to retain them in captivity,

or to cast them into prison, or to
cast them out of his land, according
to his will and pleasure.

21 And thus Ammon was carried
before the king who was over the
land of Ishmael; and his name was
Lamoni; and he was a descendant
of Ishmael.

22 And the king inquired of Am-
mon if it were his desire to dwell
in the land among the Lamanites,
or among his people.

23 And Ammon said unto him:
Yea, I desire to “dwell among this
people for a time; yea, and perhaps
until the day I die.

24 And it came to pass that king
Lamoni was much pleased with
Ammon, and caused that his bands
should be loosed; and he would
that Ammon should take one of his
daughters to wife.

25 But Ammon said unto him: Nay,
but I will be thy servant. Therefore
Ammon became a “servant to king
Lamoni. And it came to pass that
he was set among other servants to
watch the flocks of Lamoni, accord-
ing to the custom of the Lamanites.

26 And after he had been in the
service of the king three days, as he
was with the Lamanitish servants
going forth with their flocks to the
place of “water, which was called
the water of Sebus, and all the La-
manites drive their flocks hither,
that they may have water—

27 Therefore, as Ammon and the
servants of the king were driving
forth their flocks to this place of
water, behold, a certain number of
the Lamanites, who had been with
their flocks to water, stood and
*scattered the flocks of Ammon and
the servants of the king, and they
scattered them insomuch that they
fled many ways.

28 Now the servants of the king
began to murmur, saying: Now
the king will slay us, as he has our
brethren because their flocks were

 

252

scattered by the wickedness of these
men. And they began to weep ex-
ceedingly, saying: Behold, our flocks
are scattered already.

29 Now they wept because of the
fear of being slain. Now when Am-
mon saw this his heart was swollen
within him with joy; for, said he,
I will show forth my power unto
these my fellow-servants, or the
power which is in me, in restoring
these flocks unto the king, that I
may win the hearts of these my
fellow-servants, that I may lead
them to “believe in my words.

30 And now, these were the
thoughts of Ammon, when he saw
the afflictions of those whom he
termed to be his brethren.

31 And it came to pass that he flat-
tered them by his words, saying: My
brethren, be of good cheer and let
us go in search of the flocks, and
we will gather them together and
bring them back unto the place of
water; and thus we will preserve
the flocks unto the king and he
will not slay us.

32 And it came to pass that they
went in search of the flocks, and
they did follow Ammon, and they
rushed forth with much swiftness
and did head the flocks of the
king, and did gather them together
again to the place of water.

33 And those men again stood to
scatter their flocks; but Ammon
said unto his brethren: Encircle
the flocks round about that they
flee not; and 1 go and contend with
these men who do scatter our flocks.

34 Therefore, they did as Ammon
commanded them, and he went forth
and stood to contend with those
who stood by the waters of Sebus;
and they were in number not a few.

35 Therefore they did not fear
Ammon, for they supposed that
one of their men could slay him
according to their pleasure, for
they knew not that the Lord had

promised Mosiah that he would
“deliver his sons out of their hands;
neither did they know anything
concerning the Lord; therefore
they delighted in the destruction of
their brethren; and for this cause
they stood to scatter the flocks of
the king.

36 But “Ammon stood forth and
began to cast stones at them with
his sling; yea, with mighty power
he did sling stones amongst them;
and thus he slew a ’certain number
of them insomuch that they began
to be astonished at his power; nev-
ertheless they were angry because
of the slain of their brethren, and
they were determined that he
should fall; therefore, seeing that
they ‘could not hit him with their
stones, they came forth with clubs to
slay him.

37 But behold, every man that
lifted his club to smite Ammon, he
smote off their arms with his sword;
for he did withstand their blows by
smiting their arms with the edge
of his sword, insomuch that they
began to be astonished, and began
to flee before him; yea, and they
were not few in number; and he
caused them to flee by the strength
of his arm.

38 Now six of them had fallen by
the sling, but he “slew none save it
were their leader with his sword;
and he smote off as many of their
arms as were lifted against him,
and they were not a few.

39 And when he had driven them
afar off, he returned and they wa-
tered their flocks and returned them
to the pasture of the king, and then
went in unto the king, bearing the
arms which had been smitten off
by the sword of Ammon, of those
who sought to slay him; and they
were carried in unto the king fora
testimony of the things which they
had done.

 

ALMA 17:36-18:5

CHAPTER 18

King Lamoni supposes that Ammon is
the Great Spirit—Ammon teaches the
king about the Creation, God’s deal-
ings with men, and the redemption
that comes through Christ—Lamoni
believes and falls to the earth as if dead.
About 90 B.c.

AND it came to pass that king La-
moni caused that his “servants
should stand forth and testify to
all the things which they had seen
concerning the matter.

2 And when they had all testified
to the things which they had seen,
and he had learned of the faithful-
ness of Ammon in preserving his
flocks, and also of his *great power
in contending against those who
sought to slay him, he was aston-
ished exceedingly, and said: Surely,
this is more than a man. Behold,
is not this the Great Spirit who
doth send such great punishments
upon this people, because of their
murders?

3 And they answered the king,
and said: Whether he be the Great
Spirit or a man, we Know not; but
this much we do know, that he
“cannot be slain by the enemies
of the king; neither can they ’scatter
the king’s flocks when he is with
us, because of his expertness and
‘great strength; therefore, we know
that he is a friend to the king. And
now, O king, we do not believe that
a man has such great power, for we
know he cannot be slain.

4 And now, when the king heard
these words, he said unto them: Now
I know that it is the Great Spirit;
and he has come down at this time
to preserve your lives, that I might
not “slay you as I did your breth-
ren. Now this is the Great Spirit
of whom our fathers have spoken.

5 Now this was the “tradition of
Lamoni, which he had received

from his father, that there was a
’Great Spirit. Notwithstanding they
believed in a Great Spirit, they sup-
posed that ‘whatsoever they did was
right; nevertheless, Lamoni began
to fear exceedingly, with fear lest
he had done wrong in slaying his
servants;

6 For he had slain many of them
because their brethren had scattered
their flocks at the place of water;
and thus, because they had had their
flocks scattered they were slain.

7 Now it was the practice of these
Lamanites to stand by the “waters
of Sebus to scatter the flocks of the
people, that thereby they might
drive away many that were scat-
tered unto their own land, it being
a practice of plunder among them.

8 And it came to pass that king
Lamoni inquired of his servants,
saying: Where is this man that has
such great power?

9 And they said unto him: Behold,
he is feeding thy “horses. Now the
king had commanded his servants,
previous to the time of the water-
ing of their flocks, that they should
prepare his horses and chariots,
and conduct him forth to the land
of Nephi; for there had been a
’sreat ‘feast appointed at the land
of Nephi, by the father of Lamoni,
who was king over all the land.

10 Now when king Lamoni heard
that Ammon was preparing his
horses and his “chariots he was more
astonished, because of the faithful-
ness of Ammon, saying: Surely there
has not been any servant among all
my servants that has been so faith-
ful as this man; for even he doth
remember all my commandments
to execute them.

11 Now I surely know that this is
the Great Spirit, and I would desire

 

254

him that he come in unto me, but
I durst not.

12 And it came to pass that when
Ammon had made ready the horses
and the chariots for the king and
his servants, he went in unto the
king, and he saw that the ¢coun-
tenance of the king was changed;
therefore he was about to return
out of his presence.

13 And one of the king’s servants
said unto him, “Rabbanah, which
is, being interpreted, powerful or
great king, considering their kings
to be powerful; and thus he said
unto him: Rabbanah, the king de-
sireth thee to stay.

14 Therefore Ammon turned him-
self unto the king, and said unto
him: What wilt thou that I should
do for thee, O king? And the king
answered him not for the space of
an “hour, according to their time,
for he knew not what he should
say unto him.

15 And it came to pass that Am-
mon said unto him again: What
desirest thou of me? But the king
answered him not.

16 And it came to pass that Am-
mon, being filled with the “Spirit
of God, therefore he perceived the
’thoughts of the king. And he said
unto him: Is it because thou hast
heard that I defended thy servants
and thy flocks, and slew ‘seven of
their brethren with the sling and
with the sword, and smote off the
arms of others, in order to defend thy
flocks and thy servants; behold, is
it this that causeth thy marvelings?

17 | say unto you, what is it, that
thy marvelings are so great? Behold,
Iam a 4man, and am thy servant;
therefore, whatsoever thou desirest
which is right, that will I do.

18 Now when the king had heard

these words, he marveled again,
for he beheld that Ammon could
“discern his thoughts; but notwith-
standing this, king Lamoni did open
his mouth, and said unto him: Who
art thou? Art thou that Great Spirit,
who ’knows all things?

19 Ammon answered and said unto
him: I am not.

20 And the king said: How know-
est thou the thoughts of my heart?
Thou mayest speak boldly, and tell
me concerning these things; and also
tell me by what power ye slew and
smote off the arms of my brethren
that scattered my flocks—

21 And now, “if thou wilt tell me
concerning these things, whatso-
ever thou desirest I will give unto
thee; and if it were needed, I would
guard thee with my armies; but I
know that thou art more powerful
than all they; nevertheless, what-
soever thou desirest of me I will
grant it unto thee.

22 Now Ammon being ‘wise, yet
harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt
thou hearken unto my words, if I
tell thee by what power I do these
things? And this is the thing that I
desire of thee.

23 And the king answered him,
and said: Yea, I ¢will believe all
thy words. And thus he was caught
with "guile.

24 And Ammon began to speak
unto him with “boldness, and
said unto him: Believest thou that
there is a God?

25 And he answered, and said
unto him: I do not know what that
meaneth.

26 And then Ammon said: Believest
thou that there is a “Great Spirit?

27 And he said, Yea.

28 And Ammon said: This is God.

 

ALMA 18:19-37

And Ammon said unto him again:
Believest thou that this Great Spirit,
who is God, created all things which
are in heaven and in the earth?

29 And he said: Yea, I believe that
he created all things which are in
the earth; but I do not know the
heavens.

30 And Ammon said unto him:
The heavens is a place where God
dwells and all his holy angels.

31 And king Lamoni said: Is it
above the earth?

32 And Ammon said: Yea, and he
looketh down upon all the chil-
dren of men; and he “knows all the
thoughts and *intents of the heart;
for by his hand were they all cre-
ated from the beginning.

33 And king Lamoni said: I believe
all these things which thou hast
spoken. Art thou “sent from God?

34 Ammon said unto him: lama
4man; and man in the beginning was
created after the image of God, and I
am called by his "Holy Spirit to teach
these things unto this people, that
they may be brought to a knowledge
of that which is just and true;

35 And a portion of that ‘Spirit
dwelleth in me, which giveth me
’knowledge, and also power accord-
ing to my faith and desires which
are in God.

36 Now when Ammon had said
these words, he began at the cre-
ation of the world, and also the
creation of Adam, and told him all
the things concerning the fall of
man, and “rehearsed and laid be-
fore him the "records and the holy
scriptures of the people, which had
been spoken by the “prophets, even
down to the time that their father,
Lehi, left Jerusalem.

37 And he also rehearsed unto

them (for it was unto the king and to
his servants) all the journeyings of
their fathers in the wilderness, and
all their sufferings with hunger and
thirst, and their travail, and so forth.

38 And he also rehearsed unto them
concerning the “rebellions of Laman
and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael,
yea, all their rebellions did he relate
unto them; and he expounded unto
them all the "records and scriptures
from the time that Lehi left Jerusa-
lem down to the present time.

39 But this is not all; for he “ex-
pounded unto them the "plan of
redemption, which was prepared
from the foundation of the world;
and he also made known unto them
concerning the coming of Christ,
and all the works of the Lord did
he make known unto them.

40 And it came to pass that after
he had said all these things, and
expounded them to the king, that
the king “believed all his words.

41 And he began to cry unto the
Lord, saying: O Lord, have mercy;
according to thy abundant “mercy
which thou hast had upon the peo-
ple of Nephi, have upon me, and
my people.

42 And now, when he had said
this, he “fell unto the earth, °as if
he were dead.

43 And it came to pass that his
4servants took him and carried him
in unto his wife, and laid him upon
a bed; and he lay as if he were dead
for the space of two days and two
nights; and his wife, and his sons,
and his daughters mourned over
him, after the manner of the La-
manites, greatly lamenting his loss.

CHAPTER 19

Lamoni receives the light of everlasting
life and sees the Redeemer—His house-

 

256

hold falls into a trance, and many see
angels—Ammon is preserved miracu-
lously—He baptizes many and establishes
a church among them. About 90 B.c.

AND it came to pass that after two
days and two nights they were about
to take his “body and lay it in a sep-
ulchre, which they had made for
the purpose of burying their dead.

2 Now the queen having heard of
the fame of Ammon, therefore she
sent and desired that he should
come in unto her.

3 And it came to pass that Ammon
did as he was commanded, and
went in unto the queen, and desired
to know what she would that he
should do.

4 And she said unto him: The “ser-
vants of my husband have made it
known unto me that thou art a
’prophet of a holy God, and that
thou hast ‘power to do many mighty
works in his name;

5 Therefore, if this is the case, I
would that ye should go in and
see my husband, for he has been
laid upon his bed for the space
of two days and two nights; and
some say that he is not dead, but
others say that he is dead and that
he “stinketh, and that he ought to
be placed in the sepulchre; but as
for myself, to me he doth not stink.

6 Now, this was what Ammon de-
sired, for he knew that king Lam-
oni was under the power of God; he
knew that the dark “veil of °unbe-
lief was being cast away from his
mind, and the ‘light which did light
up his mind, which was the light of
the glory of God, which was a mar-
velous light of his goodness—yea,
this light had infused such joy into
his soul, the cloud of darkness hav-
ing been dispelled, and that the
light of everlasting life was lit up in

his soul, yea, he knew that this had
4overcome his natural frame, and
he was carried away in God—

7 Therefore, what the queen de-
sired of him was his only desire.
Therefore, he went in to see the
king according as the queen had
desired him; and he saw the king,
and he knew that he was not dead.

8 And he said unto the queen:
He is not dead, but he sleepeth in
God, and on the morrow he shall
rise again; therefore bury him not.

9 And Ammon said unto her:
*Believest thou this? And she said
unto him: I have had no witness
save thy word, and the word of our
servants; nevertheless I believe
that it shall be according as thou
hast said.

10 And Ammon said unto her:
Blessed art thou because of thy
exceeding faith; I say unto thee,
woman, there has not been such
great faith among all the people of
the *Nephites.

11 And it came to pass that she
watched over the bed of her hus-
band, from that time even until that
time on the morrow which Ammon
had appointed that he should rise.

12 And it came to pass that he
arose, according to the words of Am-
mon; and as he arose, he stretched
forth his hand unto the woman,
and said: Blessed be the name of
God, and blessed art thou.

13 For as sure as thou livest, be-
hold, I have “seen my Redeemer;
and he shall come forth, and be
’born of a°woman, and he shall re-
deem all mankind who believe on
his name, Now, when he had said
these words, his heart was swollen
within him, and he sunk again with
joy; and the queen also sunk down,
being overpowered by the Spirit.

14 Now Ammon seeing the Spirit

 

ALMA 19:7-18

of the Lord poured out according to
his “prayers upon the Lamanites, his
brethren, who had been the cause
of so much mourning among the
Nephites, or among all the people
of God because of their iniquities
and their *traditions, he fell upon
his knees, and began to pour out his
soul in prayer and thanksgiving to
God for what he had done for his
brethren; and he was also overpow-
ered with ‘joy; and thus they all
three had “sunk to the earth.

15 Now, when the servants of the
king had seen that they had fallen,
they also began to cry unto God,
for the fear of the Lord had come
upon them also, for it was “they
who had stood before the king and
testified unto him concerning the
great power of Ammon.

16 And it came to pass that they
did call on the name of the Lord, in
their might, even until they had all
fallen to the earth, save it were one
of the Lamanitish “women, whose
name was Abish, she having been
converted unto the Lord for many
years, on account of a remarkable
vision of her father—

17 Thus, having been converted to
the Lord, and never having made
it *known, therefore, when she saw
that all the servants of Lamoni had
’fallen to the earth, and also her
mistress, the queen, and the king,
and Ammon lay ‘prostrate upon
the earth, she knew that it was the
power of God; and supposing that
this opportunity, by making known
unto the people what had happened
among them, that by beholding this
scene it would “cause them to be-
lieve in the power of God, therefore
she ran forth from house to house,
making it known unto the people.

18 And they began to assemble
themselves together unto the house

of the king. And there came a mul-
titude, and to their astonishment,
they beheld the king, and the queen,
and their servants prostrate upon
the earth, and they all lay there as
though they were dead; and they
also saw Ammon, and behold, he
was a Nephite.

19 And now the people began to
murmur among themselves; some
saying that it was a great evil that
had come upon them, or upon the
king and his house, because he had
suffered that the Nephite should
“remain in the land.

20 But others rebuked them, say-
ing: The king hath brought this evil
upon his house, because he slew his
servants who had had their flocks
scattered at the “waters of Sebus.

21 And they were also rebuked
by those men who had stood at the
waters of Sebus and ‘scattered the
flocks which belonged to the king,
for they were angry with Ammon
because of the number which he
had slain of their brethren at the
waters of Sebus, while defending
the flocks of the king.

22 Now, one of them, whose brother
had been ‘slain with the sword of
Ammon, being exceedingly angry
with Ammon, drew his sword and
went forth that he might let it fall
upon Ammon, to slay him; and as
he lifted the sword to smite him,
behold, he fell dead.

23 Now we see that Ammon could
not be slain, for the “Lord had said
unto Mosiah, his father: I will spare
him, and it shall be unto him ac-
cording to thy faith—therefore,
Mosiah °trusted him unto the Lord.

24 And it came to pass that when
the multitude beheld that the man
had fallen dead, who lifted the
sword to slay Ammon, “fear came
upon them all, and they durst not
put forth their hands to touch him

 

258

or any of those who had fallen; and
they began to marvel again among
themselves what could be the cause
of this great power, or what all these
things could mean.

25 And it came to pass that there
were many among them who said
that Ammon was the “Great Spirit,
and others said he was sent by the
Great Spirit;

26 But others rebuked them all,
saying that he was a “monster, who
had been sent from the Nephites to
torment them.

27 And there were some who said
that Ammon was sent by the Great
Spirit to afflict them because of
their iniquities; and that it was
the Great Spirit that had always at-
tended the Nephites, who had ever
delivered them out of their hands;
and they said that it was this Great
Spirit who had destroyed so many
of their brethren, the Lamanites.

28 And thus the contention be-
gan to be exceedingly sharp among
them. And while they were thus
contending, the *woman servant
who had caused the multitude to
be gathered together came, and
when she saw the contention which
was among the multitude she was
exceedingly sorrowful, even unto
tears.

29 And it came to pass that she
went and took the queen by the
“hand, that perhaps she might raise
her from the ground; and as soon
as she touched her hand she arose
and stood upon her feet, and cried
with a loud voice, saying: O blessed
Jesus, who has saved me from an
bawful hell! O blessed God, have
“mercy on this people!

30 And when she had said this, she
clasped her hands, being filled with
joy, speaking many words which
were not understood; and when she
had done this, she took the king,

Lamoni, by the hand, and behold
he arose and stood upon his feet.

31 And he, immediately, seeing
the contention among his people,
went forth and began to rebuke
them, and to teach them the words
which he had heard from the mouth
of Ammon; and as many as heard
his words believed, and were con-
verted unto the Lord.

32 But there were “many among
them who would not hear his words;
therefore they went their way.

33 And it came to pass that when
Ammon arose he also administered
unto them, and also did all the ser-
vants of Lamoni; and they did all
declare unto the people the selfsame
thing—that their hearts had been
“changed; that they had no more
desire to do "evil.

34 And behold, many did declare
unto the people that they had seen
“angels and had conversed with them;
and thus they had told them things
of God, and of his righteousness.

35 And it came to pass that there
were many that did “believe in their
words; and as many as did believe
were baptized; and they became a
righteous people, and they did es-
tablish a church among them.

36 And thus the work of the Lord
did commence among the Laman-
ites; thus the Lord did begin to pour
out his “Spirit upon them; and we
see that his arm is extended to "all
people who will repent and believe
on his name.

CHAPTER 20
The Lord sends Ammon to Middoni to
deliver his imprisoned brethren—Am-
mon and Lamoni meet Lamoni’s father,
who is king over all the land—Ammon
compels the old king to approve the
release of his brethren. About 90 B.c.

 

ALMA 19:31-20:8

AND it came to pass that when they
had established a church in that
“land, that king Lamoni desired that
Ammon should go with him to the
land of Nephi, that he might show
him unto his father.

2 And the voice of the Lord came
to Ammon, saying: Thou shalt not go
up to the land of Nephi, for behold,
the king will seek thy life; but thou
shalt go to the land of *Middoni; for
behold, thy brother Aaron, and also
Muloki and Ammah are in prison.

3 Now it came to pass that when
Ammon had heard this, he said unto
Lamoni: Behold, my brother and
brethren are in prison at Middoni,
and I go that I may deliver them.

4 Now Lamoni said unto Ammon:
I know, in the “strength of the Lord
thou canst do all things. But behold,
I will go with thee to the land of
Middoni; for the king of the land
of Middoni, whose name is Anti-
omno, is a friend unto me; therefore
I go to the land of Middoni, that I
may flatter the king of the land,
and he will cast thy brethren out
of °prison. Now Lamoni said unto
him: Who told thee that thy breth-
ren were in prison?

5 And Ammon said unto him: No
one hath told me, save it be God;
and he said unto me—Go and de-
liver thy brethren, for they are in
prison in the land of Middoni.

6 Now when Lamoni had heard
this he caused that his servants
should make ready his “horses and
his chariots.

7 And he said unto Ammon: Come,
I will go with thee down to the land
of Middoni, and there I will plead
with the king that he will cast thy
brethren out of prison.

8 And it came to pass that as Am-
mon and Lamoni were journeying

thither, they met the father of
Lamoni, who was king “over all
the land.

9 And behold, the father of La-
moni said unto him: Why did ye
“not come to the *feast on that great
day when I made a feast unto my
sons, and unto my people?

10 And he also said: Whither art
thou going with this Nephite, who
is one of the children of a “liar?

11 And it came to pass that La-
moni rehearsed unto him whither
he was going, for he feared to offend
him,

12 And he also told him all the
cause of his tarrying in his own
kingdom, that he did not go unto
his father to the feast which he had
prepared.

13 And now when Lamoni had re-
hearsed unto him all these things,
behold, to his astonishment, his
father was angry with him, and said:
Lamoni, thou art going to deliver
these Nephites, who are sons of a
liar. Behold, he robbed our fathers;
and now his children are also come
amongst us that they may, by their
cunning and their lyings, deceive
us, that they again may rob us of
our property.

14 Now the father of Lamoni com-
manded him that he should slay
Ammon with the sword. And he
also commanded him that he should
not go to the land of Middoni, but
that he should return with him to
the land of “Ishmael.

15 But Lamoni said unto him: I
will not slay Ammon, neither will
lreturn to the land of Ishmael, but
I go to the land of Middoni that I
may release the brethren of Ammon,
for | know that they are just men
and holy prophets of the true God.

16 Now when his father had heard
these words, he was angry with
him, and he drew his sword that
he might smite him to the earth.

 

260

17 But Ammon stood forth and
said unto him: Behold, thou shalt
not slay thy son; nevertheless, it
were “better that he should fall than
thee, for behold, he has "repented
of his sins; but if thou shouldst fall
at this time, in thine anger, thy soul
could not be saved.

18 And again, it is expedient that
thou shouldst forbear; for if thou
shouldst ¢slay thy son, he being an
innocent man, his blood would cry
from the ground to the Lord his
God, for vengeance to come upon
thee; and perhaps thou wouldst
lose thy ’soul.

19 Now when Ammon had said
these words unto him, he answered
him, saying: I know that if I should
slay my son, that I should shed in-
nocent blood; for it is thou that hast
sought to destroy him.

20 And he stretched forth his hand
to slay Ammon. But Ammon with-
stood his blows, and also smote his
arm that he could not use it.

21 Now when the king saw that
Ammon could slay him, he began
to plead with Ammon that he would
spare his life.

22 But Ammon raised his sword,
and said unto him: Behold, I will
smite thee except thou wilt grant
unto me that my brethren may be
“cast out of prison.

23 Now the king, fearing he should
lose his life, said: If thou wilt spare
me I will grant unto thee whatso-
ever thou wilt ask, even to half of
the kingdom.

24 Now when Ammon saw that he
had wrought upon the old king ac-
cording to his desire, he said unto
him: If thou wilt grant that my
brethren may be cast out of prison,
and also that Lamoni may retain his
kingdom, and that ye be not dis-
pleased with him, but grant that he
may do according to his own desires
in *whatsoever thing he thinketh,

then will I spare thee; otherwise I
will smite thee to the earth.

25 Now when Ammon had said
these words, the king began to re-
joice because of his life.

26 And when he saw that Ammon
had no desire to destroy him, and
when he also saw the great “love
he had for his son Lamoni, he was
astonished exceedingly, and said:
Because this is all that thou hast
desired, that I would "release thy
brethren, and suffer that my son
Lamoni should retain his kingdom,
behold, I will grant unto you that
my son may retain his kingdom
from this time and forever; and I
will govern him no more—

27 And | will also grant unto thee
that thy brethren may be cast out
of prison, and thou and thy breth-
ren may come unto me, in my king-
dom; for I shall greatly desire to
see thee. For the king was greatly
astonished at the words which he
had spoken, and also at the words
which had been spoken by his son
Lamoni, therefore he was “desirous to
learn them.

28 And it came to pass that Am-
mon and Lamoni proceeded on
their journey towards the land of
Middoni. And Lamoni found favor
in the eyes of the king of the land;
therefore the brethren of Ammon
were brought forth out of prison.

29 And when Ammon did meet
them he was exceedingly sorrowful,
for behold they were naked, and
their skins were worn exceedingly
because of being bound with strong
cords. And they also had “suffered
hunger, thirst, and all kinds of af-
flictions; nevertheless they were
’patient in all their sufferings.

30 And, as it happened, it was their
lot to have fallen into the hands of
a more hardened and a more “stiff-
necked people; therefore they would
not hearken unto their words, and

 

ALMA 20:25-21:4

they had cast them out, and had
smitten them, and had driven them
from house to house, and from
place to place, even until they had
arrived in the land of Middoni; and
there they were taken and cast into
prison, and bound with °strong
cords, and kept in prison for many
days, and were delivered by Lamoni
and Ammon.

An account of the preaching of
Aaron, and Muloki, and their breth-
ren, to the Lamanites.

Comprising chapters 21 through 25.

CHAPTER 21

Aaron teaches the Amalekites about
Christ and His Atonement—Aaron
and his brethren are imprisoned in
Middoni—After their deliverance, they
teach in the synagogues and make many
converts—Lamoni grants religious free-
dom to the people in the land of Ishmael.
About 90-77 B.c.

Now when Ammon and his breth-
ren “separated themselves in the
borders of the land of the Laman-
ites, behold Aaron took his journey
towards the land which was called
by the Lamanites, *Jerusalem, call-
ing it after the land of their fathers’
nativity; and it was away joining
the borders of Mormon.

2 Now the Lamanites and the
Amalekites and the people of ¢Amu-
lon had built a great city, which
was called Jerusalem.

3 Now the Lamanites of themselves
were sufficiently hardened, but
the Amalekites and the Amulonites
were still harder; therefore they
did cause the Lamanites that they
should harden their hearts, that
they should wax strong in wicked-
ness and their abominations.

4 And it came to pass that Aaron
came to the city of Jerusalem, and

first began to preach to the Amale-
kites. And he began to preach to
them in their “synagogues, for they
had built synagogues after the "or-
der of the Nehors; for many of the
Amalekites and the Amulonites
were after the order of the Nehors.

5 Therefore, as Aaron entered into
one of their “synagogues to preach
unto the people, and as he was
speaking unto them, behold there
arose an Amalekite and began to
contend with him, saying: What is
that thou hast testified? Hast thou
seen an "angel? Why do not angels
appear unto us? Behold ‘are not
this people as good as thy people?

6 Thou also sayest, except we re-
pent we shall perish. How knowest
thou the thought and intent of our
hearts? How knowest thou that we
have cause to repent? How knowest
thou that we are not a “righteous peo-
ple? Behold, we have built ’sanctu-
aries, and we do assemble ourselves
together to worship ‘God. We do
believe that God will save all men.

7 Now Aaron said unto him: Be-
lievest thou that the Son of God
shall come to redeem mankind
from their sins?

8 And the man said unto him: We
do not “believe that thou knowest
any such thing. We do not believe
in these foolish traditions. We do
not believe that thou knowest of
things to come, neither do we be-
lieve that thy fathers and also that
our fathers did know concerning
the things which they spake, of that
which is to come.

9 Now Aaron began to open the
“scriptures unto them concern-
ing the coming of Christ, and also
concerning the resurrection of the
dead, and that there could be °no
redemption for mankind ‘save it

 

262

were through the ‘death and suffer-
ings of Christ, and the atonement of
his blood.

10 And it came to pass as he began
to expound these things unto them
they were angry with him, and be-
gan to “mock him; and they would
not hear the words which he spake.

11 Therefore, when he saw that
they would not hear his words, he
departed out of their synagogue,
and came over to a village which
was called Ani-Anti, and there he
found Muloki preaching the word
unto them; and also Ammah and
his brethren. And they contended
with many about the word.

12 And it came to pass that they
saw that the people would harden
their hearts, therefore they departed
and came over into the land of
*Middoni. And they did preach the
word unto many, and "few believed
on the words which they taught.

13 Nevertheless, Aaron and a cer-
tain number of his brethren were
taken and cast into “prison, and the
remainder of them fled out of the
land of Middoni unto the regions
round about.

14 And those who were cast into
prison “suffered many things, and
they were delivered by the hand
of Lamoni and Ammon, and they
were fed and clothed.

15 And they went forth again to
declare the word, and thus they were
delivered for the first time out of
prison; and thus they had suffered.

16 And they went forth whither-
soever they were led by the “Spirit
of the Lord, preaching the word
of God in every synagogue of the
Amalekites, or in every assembly
of the Lamanites where they could
be admitted.

17 And it came to pass that the

Lord began to bless them, insomuch
that they brought many to the
knowledge of the truth; yea, they
did “convince many of their sins,
and of the traditions of their fathers,
which were not correct.

18 And it came to pass that Am-
mon and Lamoni returned from
the land of Middoni to the land
of “Ishmael, which was the land of
their inheritance.

19 And king Lamoni would not
suffer that Ammon should serve
him, or be his “servant.

20 But he caused that there should
be “synagogues built in the land
of Ishmael; and he caused that his
people, or the people who were
under his reign, should assemble
themselves together.

21 And he did rejoice over them,
and he did teach them many things.
And he did also declare unto them
that they were a people who were
under him, and that they were a
“free people, that they were free
from the oppressions of the king,
his father; for that his father had
granted unto him that he might
reign over the people who were in
the land of Ishmael, and in all the
land round about.

22 And he also declared unto them
that they might have the “liberty
of worshiping the Lord their God
according to their desires, in what-
soever place they were in, if it were
in the land which was under the
reign of king Lamoni.

23 And Ammon did preach unto
the people of king Lamoni; and
it came to pass that he did teach
them all things concerning things
pertaining to righteousness. And
he did exhort them daily, with all
diligence; and they gave heed unto
his word, and they were “zealous for
keeping the commandments of God.

 

ALMA 21:18-22:5

CHAPTER 22

Aaron teaches Lamoni’s father about
the Creation, the Fall of Adam, and the
plan of redemption through Christ—
The king and all his household are
converted—The division of the land be-
tween the Nephites and the Lamanites
is explained. About 90-77 B.c.

Now, as Ammon was thus teaching
the people of Lamoni continually,
we will return to the account of
Aaron and his brethren; for after he
departed from the land of Middoni
he was “led by the Spirit to the land
of Nephi, even to the house of the
king which was "over all the land
‘save it were the land of Ishmael;
and he was the father of Lamoni.

2 And it came to pass that he went
in unto him into the king’s palace,
with his brethren, and bowed him-
self before the king, and said unto
him: Behold, O king, we are the
brethren of Ammon, whom thou
hast “delivered out of °prison.

3 And now, O king, if thou wilt
spare our lives, we will be thy
servants. And the king said unto
them: Arise, for I will grant unto
you your lives, and I will not suffer
that ye shall be my servants; but I
will insist that ye shall administer
unto me; for Ihave been somewhat
“troubled in mind because of the
’senerosity and the greatness of
the words of thy brother Ammon;
and I desire to know the cause why
he has not come up out of Middoni
with thee.

4 And Aaron said unto the king:
Behold, the Spirit of the Lord has
called him another way; he has gone
“to the land of Ishmael, to teach the
people of Lamoni.

5 Now the king said unto them:
What is this that ye have said
concerning the Spirit of the Lord?

Behold, this is the thing which doth
trouble me.

6 And also, what is this that Am-
mon said—‘If ye will repent ye shall
be saved, and if ye will not repent,
ye shall be cast off at the last day?

7 And Aaron answered him and
said unto him: Believest thou that
there is a God? And the king said: I
know that the Amalekites say that
there is a God, and I have granted
unto them that they should build
sanctuaries, that they may assem-
ble themselves together to worship
him. And if now thou sayest there
is a God, behold I will “believe.

8 And now when Aaron heard this,
his heart began to rejoice, and he
said: Behold, assuredly as thou liv-
est, O king, there is a God.

9 And the king said: Is God that
*Great Spirit that brought our
fathers out of the land of Jerusalem?

10 And Aaron said unto him: Yea,
he is that Great Spirit, and he “cre-
ated all things both in heaven and
in earth. Believest thou this?

11 And he said: Yea, I believe that
the Great Spirit created all things,
and I desire that ye should tell me
concerning all these things, and I
will “believe thy words.

12 And it came to pass that when
Aaron saw that the king would
believe his words, he began from
the creation of Adam, “reading the
scriptures unto the king—how God
’created man after his own image,
and that God gave him command-
ments, and that because of trans-
gression, man had fallen.

13 And Aaron did expound unto
him the scriptures from the “cre-
ation of Adam, laying the fall of man

 

264

before him, and their carnal state
and also the "plan of ‘redemption,
which was prepared “from the foun-
dation of the world, through Christ,
for all whosoever would believe on
his name.

14 And since man had “fallen he
could not *merit anything of him-
self; but the sufferings and “death
of Christ ‘atone for their sins,
through faith and repentance, and
so forth; and that he breaketh the
bands of death, that the ‘grave shall
have no victory, and that the sting
of death should be swallowed up
in the hopes of glory; and Aaron
did expound all these things unto
the king.

15 And it came to pass that after
Aaron had expounded these things
unto him, the king said: *What shall
Ido that I may have this eternal life
of which thou hast spoken? Yea,
what shall I do that I may be "born
of God, having this wicked spirit
‘rooted out of my breast, and receive
his Spirit, that I may be filled with
joy, that I may not be cast off at the
last day? Behold, said he, I will give
up “all that I possess, yea, I will for-
sake my kingdom, that I may receive
this great joy.

16 But Aaron said unto him: If
thou desirest this thing, if thou wilt
“bow down before God, yea, if thou
wilt repent of all thy sins, and will
bow down before God, and call on
his name in faith, believing that ye
shall receive, then shalt thou receive
the "hope which thou desirest.

17 And it came to pass that when
Aaron had said these words, the
king did “bow down before the Lord,
upon his knees; yea, even he did

prostrate himself upon the earth,
and cried *mightily, saying:

18 O God, Aaron hath told me that
there is a God; and if there is a God,
and if thou art God, wilt thou make
thyself known unto me, and I will
give away all my sins to know thee,
and that I may be raised from the
dead, and be saved at the last day.
And now when the king had said
these words, he was struck “as if he
were dead.

19 And it came to pass that his
servants ran and told the queen all
that had happened unto the king.
And she came in unto the king; and
when she saw him lay as if he were
dead, and also Aaron and his breth-
ren standing as though they had
been the cause of his fall, she was
angry with them, and commanded
that her servants, or the servants
of the king, should take them and
slay them.

20 Now the servants had seen the
cause of the king’s fall, therefore
they durst not lay their hands on
Aaron and his brethren; and they
pled with the queen saying: Why
commandest thou that we should
slay these men, when behold one
of them is “mightier than us all?
Therefore we shall fall before them.

21 Now when the queen saw the
fear of the servants she also be-
gan to fear exceedingly, lest there
should some evil come upon her.
And she commanded her servants
that they should go and call the
people, that they might slay Aaron
and his brethren.

22 Now when Aaron saw the de-
termination of the queen, he, also
knowing the hardness of the hearts
of the people, feared lest that a
multitude should assemble them-
selves together, and there should
be a great contention and a distur-
bance among them; therefore he

 

ALMA 22:18-27

put forth his “hand and raised the
king from the earth, and said unto
him: Stand. And he stood upon his
feet, receiving his strength.

23 Now this was done in the pres-
ence of the queen and many of the
servants. And when they saw it
they greatly marveled, and began
to fear. And the king stood forth,
and began to “minister unto them.
And he did minister unto them, in-
somuch that his whole household
were ‘converted unto the Lord.

24 Now there was a multitude
gathered together because of the
commandment of the queen, and
there began to be great murmur-
ings among them because of Aaron
and his brethren.

25 But the king stood forth among
them and administered unto them.
And they were “pacified towards
Aaron and those who were with him.

26 And it came to pass that when
the king saw that the people were
pacified, he caused that Aaron and
his brethren should stand forth in the
midst of the multitude, and that they
should preach the word unto them.

27 And it came to pass that the
king sent a “proclamation through-
out all the land, amongst all his
people who were in all his land,
who were in all the regions round
about, which was bordering even
to the sea, on the east and on the
>west, and which was divided from
the land of ‘Zarahemla by a narrow
strip of wilderness, which ran from
the sea east even to the sea west,
and round about on the borders of
the seashore, and the borders of the
wilderness which was on the north
by the land of Zarahemla, through
the borders of “Manti, by the head
of the ‘river Sidon, running from
the east towards the west—and
thus were the Lamanites and the
Nephites divided.

28 Now, the more “idle part of the
Lamanites lived in the wilderness,
and dwelt in tents; and they were
spread through the wilderness on
the west, in the land of Nephi; yea,
and also on the west of the land of
Zarahemla, in the borders by the
seashore, and on the west in the
land of Nephi, in the place of their
fathers’ first inheritance, and thus
bordering along by the seashore.

29 And also there were many La-
manites on the east by the seashore,
whither the Nephites had driven
them. And thus the Nephites were
nearly surrounded by the Laman-
ites; nevertheless the Nephites had
taken possession of all the north-
ern parts of the land bordering on
the wilderness, at the head of the
river Sidon, from the east to the
west, round about on the wilder-
ness side; on the north, even until
they came to the land which they
called “Bountiful.

30 And it bordered upon the
land which they called *Desola-
tion, it being so far northward that
it came into the land which had
been peopled and been destroyed,
of whose "bones we have spoken,
which was discovered by the ‘peo-
ple of Zarahemla, it being the place
of their “first landing.

31 And they came from there “up
into the south wilderness, Thus the
*land on the northward was called
‘Desolation, and the land on the
southward was called Bountiful,
it being the wilderness which is
filled with all manner of wild ani-
mals of every kind, a part of which
had come from the land northward
for food.

32 And now, it was only the @dis-
tance of a day and a half’s journey
for a Nephite, on the line Bountiful
and the land Desolation, from the
east to the west sea; and thus the

 

266

land of Nephi and the land of Zara-
hemla were nearly surrounded by
water, there being a small *neck of
land between the land northward
and the land southward.

33 And it came to pass that the
Nephites had inhabited the land
Bountiful, even from the east unto
the west sea, and thus the Nephites
in their wisdom, with their guards
and their armies, had hemmed in
the Lamanites on the south, that
thereby they should have no more
possession on the north, that they
might not overrun the land north-
ward.

34 Therefore the Lamanites could
have no more possessions only in
the land of Nephi, and the wilder-
ness round about. Now this was
wisdom in the Nephites—as the
Lamanites were an enemy to them,
they would not suffer their afflictions
on every hand, and also that they
might have a country whither
they might flee, according to their
desires,

35 And now I, after having said
this, return again to the account
of Ammon and Aaron, Omner and
Himni, and their brethren.

CHAPTER 23

Religious freedom is proclaimed—The
Lamanites in seven lands and cities
dare converted—They call themselves
Anti-Nephi-Lehies and are freed from
the curse—The Amalekites and the
Amulonites reject the truth. About
90-77 B.C.

BEHOLD, now it came to pass that
the king of the Lamanites sent a
“proclamation among all his people,
that they should not lay their hands
on Ammon, or Aaron, or Omner, or
Himni, nor either of their brethren
who should go forth preaching the
word of God, in whatsoever place

they should be, in any part of their
land.

2 Yea, he sent a decree among
them, that they should not lay their
hands on them to bind them, or
to cast them into prison; neither
should they spit upon them, nor
smite them, nor cast them out of
their “synagogues, nor scourge them;
neither should they cast stones at
them, but that they should have
free access to their houses, and also
their temples, and their "sanctuaries,

3 And thus they might go forth
and preach the word according to
their desires, for the king had been
converted unto the Lord, and all
his "household; therefore he sent
his proclamation throughout the
land unto his people, that the word
of God might have no obstruction,
but that it might go forth through-
out all the land, that his people
might be convinced concerning
the wicked ‘traditions of their
fathers, and that they might be con-
vinced that they were all brethren,
and that they ought not to murder,
nor to plunder, nor to steal, nor to
commit adultery, nor to commit
any manner of wickedness.

4 And now it came to pass that
when the king had sent forth this
proclamation, that Aaron and his
brethren went forth from “city to
city, and from one house of worship
to another, establishing churches,
and consecrating "priests and teach-
ers throughout the land among the
Lamanites, to preach and to teach
the word of God among them;
and thus they began to have great
success.

5 And “thousands were brought
to the knowledge of the Lord,
yea, thousands were brought to

 

ALMA 23:2-14

believe in the *traditions of the
Nephites; and they were taught the
‘records and prophecies which were
handed down even to the present
time.

6 And as sure as the Lord liveth, so
sure as many as believed, or as many
as were brought to the knowledge of
the truth, through the preaching
of Ammon and his brethren, accord-
ing to the spirit of revelation and
of prophecy, and the power of God
working “miracles in them—yea, I
say unto you, as the Lord liveth, as
many of the Lamanites as believed
in their preaching, and were ’con-
verted unto the Lord, ‘never did
fall away.

7 For they became a righteous peo-
ple; they did lay down the weapons
of their rebellion, that they did not
fight against God any more, neither
against any of their brethren.

8 Now, these are “they who were
converted unto the Lord:

9 The people of the Lamanites
who were in the land of Ishmael;

10 And also of the people of the
Lamanites who were in the land
of *Middoni;

11 And also of the people of the
Lamanites who were in the city of
Nephi;

12 And also of the people of the
Lamanites who were in the land of
*Shilom, and who were in the land
of Shemlon, and in the city of Lem-
uel, and in the city of Shimnilom.

13 And these are the names of the
cities of the Lamanites which were
“converted unto the Lord; and these
are they that laid down the weap-
ons of their rebellion, yea, all their
weapons of war; and they were all
Lamanites.

14 And the Amalekites were not

“converted, save only one; neither
were any of the "Amulonites; but they
did harden their hearts, and also
the hearts of the Lamanites in that
part of the land wheresoever they
dwelt, yea, and all their villages and
all their cities.

15 Therefore, we have named all
the cities of the Lamanites in which
they did repent and come to the
knowledge of the truth, and were
converted.

16 And now it came to pass that the
king and those who were converted
were desirous that they might have
a name, that thereby they might be
distinguished from their brethren;
therefore the king consulted with
Aaron and many of their priests, con-
cerning the name that they should
take upon them, that they might
be distinguished.

17 And it came to pass that they
called their names “Anti-Nephi-
Lehies; and they were called by
this name and were no more called
’Lamanites.

18 And they began to be a very
“industrious people; yea, and they
were friendly with the Nephites;
therefore, they did "open a corre-
spondence with them, and the ‘curse
of God did no more follow them.

CHAPTER 24

The Lamanites come against the people
of God—The Anti-Nephi-Lehies rejoice
in Christ and are visited by angels—
They choose to suffer death rather than
to defend themselves—More Lamanites
are converted. About 90-77 B.c.

AND it came to pass that the Amale-
kites and the Amulonites and the
Lamanites who were in the land
of ¢Amulon, and also in the land of
’Helam, and who were in the land
of ‘Jerusalem, and in fine, in all the

 

268

land round about, who had not been
converted and had not taken upon
them the name of “Anti-Nephi-Lehi,
were stirred up by the Amalekites
and by the Amulonites to anger
against their brethren.

2 And their hatred became ex-
ceedingly sore against them, even
insomuch that they began to rebel
against their king, insomuch that
they would not that he should be
their king; therefore, they took up
arms against the people of Anti-
Nephi-Lehi.

3 Now the king conferred the king-
dom upon his son, and he called his
name Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

4 And the king died in that self-
same year that the Lamanites be-
gan to make preparations for war
against the people of God.

5 Now when Ammon and his breth-
ren and all those who had come up
with him saw the preparations of
the Lamanites to destroy their breth-
ren, they came forth to the land of
Midian, and there Ammon met all
his brethren; and from thence they
came to the land of Ishmael that
they might hold a “council with
Lamoni and also with his brother
Anti-Nephi-Lehi, what they should
do to defend themselves against the
Lamanites.

6 Now there was not one soul
among all the people who had been
converted unto the Lord that would
take up arms against their brethren;
nay, they would not even make any
preparations for war; yea, and also
their king commanded them that
they should not.

7 Now, these are the words which
he said unto the people concern-
ing the matter: I thank my God,
my beloved people, that our great
God has in goodness sent these our
brethren, the Nephites, unto us to

preach unto us, and to convince us of
the “traditions of our wicked fathers.

8 And behold, I thank my great
God that he has given us a portion
of his Spirit to soften our hearts, that
we have “opened a correspondence
with these brethren, the Nephites.

9 And behold, Lalso thank my God,
that by opening this correspon-
dence we have been convinced of
our “sins, and of the many murders
which we have committed.

10 And I also thank my God, yea,
my great God, that he hath granted
unto us that we might repent of
these things, and also that he hath
“forgiven us of those our many sins
and murders which we have com-
mitted, and taken away the °guilt
from our hearts, through the mer-
its of his Son.

11 And now behold, my brethren,
since it has been all that we could
do (as we were the most lost of all
mankind) to repent of all our sins
and the many murders which we
have committed, and to get God to
“take them away from our hearts,
for it was all we could do to repent
sufficiently before God that he
would take away our stain—

12 Now, my best beloved breth-
ren, since God hath taken away
our stains, and our swords have be-
come bright, then let us stain our
swords no more with the blood of
our brethren.

13 Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let
us retain our swords that they be
not stained with the blood of our
brethren; for perhaps, if we should
stain our swords “again they can no
more be *washed bright through
the blood of the Son of our great
God, which shall be shed for the
atonement of our sins.

14 And the great God has had
mercy on us, and made these things

 

ALMA 24:8-18

known unto us that we might not
perish; yea, and he has made these
things known unto us beforehand,
because he loveth our “souls as well
as he loveth our children; therefore,
in his mercy he doth visit us by his
angels, that the "plan of salvation
might be made known unto us as
well as unto future generations.

15 Oh, how merciful is our God!
And now behold, since it has been
as much as we could do to get our
stains taken away from us, and our
swords are made bright, let us “hide
them away that they may be kept
bright, as a testimony to our God at
the last day, or at the day that we
shall be brought to stand before
him to be judged, that we have not
stained our swords in the blood of
our brethren since he imparted
his word unto us and has made us
’clean thereby.

16 And now, my brethren, if our
brethren seek to destroy us, behold,
we will hide away our swords, yea,
even we will bury them deep in the
earth, that they may be kept bright,
as a testimony that we have never
used them, at the last day; and if
our brethren destroy us, behold,
we shall “go to our God and shall
be saved.

17 And now it came to pass that
when the king had made an end of
these sayings, and all the people
were assembled together, they took
their swords, and all the weapons
which were used for the shedding
of man’s blood, and they did “bury
them up deep in the earth.

18 And this they did, it being in
their view a testimony to God, and
also to men, that they “never would
use weapons again for the shedding
of man’s blood; and this they did,
vouching and ’covenanting with
God, that rather than shed the

blood of their brethren they would
‘give up their own lives; and rather
than take away from a brother they
would give unto him; and rather
than spend their days in idleness
they would labor abundantly with
their hands.

19 And thus we see that, when
these Lamanites were brought to
“believe and to Know the truth, they
were *firm, and would suffer even
unto death rather than commit sin;
and thus we see that they buried
their weapons of peace, or they bur-
ied the weapons of war, for peace.

20 And it came to pass that their
brethren, the Lamanites, made pre-
parations for war, and came up to
the land of Nephi for the purpose
of destroying the king, and to place
Zanother in his stead, and also of
destroying the people of Anti-
Nephi-Lehi out of the land.

21 Now when the people saw that
they were coming against them they
went out to meet them, and “pros-
trated themselves before them to the
earth, and began to call on the name
of the Lord; and thus they were
in this attitude when the Laman-
ites began to fall upon them, and
began to slay them with the sword.

22 And thus without meeting any
resistance, they did slay a “thousand
and five of them; and we know that
they are blessed, for they have gone
to dwell with their God.

23 Now when the Lamanites saw
that their brethren would not flee
from the sword, neither would they
turn aside to the right hand or to the
left, but that they would lie down
and “perish, and ’praised God even
in the very act of perishing under
the sword—

24 Now when the Lamanites saw

 

270

this they did “forbear from slaying
them; and there were many whose
hearts had "swollen in them for those
of their brethren who had fallen
under the sword, for they repented
of the things which they had done.

25 And it came to pass that they
threw down their weapons of war,
and they would not take them
again, for they were stung for the
murders which they had committed;
and they came down even as their
brethren, relying upon the mercies
of those whose arms were lifted to
slay them.

26 And it came to pass that the
people of God were joined that day
by more than the number who had
been slain; and those who had been
slain were righteous people, there-
fore we have no reason to doubt but
what they were “saved.

27 And there was not a wicked man
slain among them; but there were
more than a thousand brought to
the knowledge of the truth; thus we
see that the Lord worketh in many
“ways to the salvation of his people.

28 Now the greatest number of
those of the Lamanites who slew so
many of their brethren were Amale-
kites and Amulonites, the greatest
number of whom were after the
“order of the "Nehors.

29 Now, among those who joined
the people of the Lord, there were
“none who were Amalekites or Amu-
lonites, or who were of the order of
Nehor, but they were actual descen-
dants of Laman and Lemuel.

30 And thus we can plainly dis-
cern, that after a people have been
once “enlightened by the Spirit of
God, and have had great “knowledge
of things pertaining to righteous-
ness, and then have “fallen away into

CHAPTER 25

Lamanite aggressions spread—The
seed of the priests of Noah perish as
Abinadi prophesied—Many Laman-
ites are converted and join the people
of Anti-Nephi-Lehi—They believe in
Christ and keep the law of Moses. About
90-77 B.C.

AND behold, now it came to pass
that those Lamanites were more
angry because they had slain their
brethren; therefore they swore
vengeance upon the Nephites; and
they did “no more attempt to slay
the people of "Anti-Nephi-Lehi at
that time.

2 But they took their armies and
went over into the borders of the
land of Zarahemla, and fell upon
the people who were in the land of
Ammonihah and “destroyed them.

3 And after that, they had ¢many
battles with the Nephites, in the
which they were driven and slain.

4 And among the Lamanites who
were slain were almost all the “seed
of Amulon and his brethren, who
were the priests of Noah, and they
were slain by the hands of the
Nephites;

5 And the remainder, having fled
into the east wilderness, and hav-
ing usurped the power and “au-
thority over the Lamanites, caused
that many of the Lamanites should
’nerish by fire because of their
belief—

6 For many of “them, after having
suffered much loss and so many
afflictions, began to be stirred
up in remembrance of the "words
which Aaron and his brethren had

 

ALMA 25:1-13

preached to them in their land;
therefore they began to disbelieve
the ‘traditions of their fathers, and
to believe in the Lord, and that he
gave great power unto the Nephites;
and thus there were many of them
converted in the wilderness.

7 And it came to pass that those
rulers who were the remnant of
the children of “Amulon caused
that they should be put to ’death,
yea, all those that believed in these
things.

8 Now this martyrdom caused that
many of their brethren should be
stirred up to anger; and there began
to be contention in the wilderness;
and the Lamanites began to “hunt
the seed of Amulon and his breth-
ren and began to slay them; and
they fled into the east wilderness.

9 And behold they are hunted at
this day by the Lamanites. Thus
the words of Abinadi were brought
to pass, which he said concerning
the seed of the priests who caused
that he should suffer death by fire.

10 For he said unto them: What ye
shall “do unto me shall be a type
of things to come.

11 And now Abinadi was the first
that suffered “death by fire because
of his belief in God; now this is
what he meant, that many should
suffer death by fire, according as
he had suffered.

12 And he said unto the priests of
Noah that their seed should cause
many to be put to death, in the
like manner as he was, and that
they should be scattered abroad
and slain, even as a sheep having
no shepherd is driven and slain by
wild beasts; and now behold, these
words were verified, for they were
driven by the Lamanites, and they
were hunted, and they were smitten.

13 And it came to pass that when

the Lamanites saw that they could
not overpower the Nephites they re-
turned again to their own land; and
many of them came over to dwell in
the land of “Ishmael and the land
of Nephi, and did join themselves
to the people of God, who were the
people of "Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

14 And they did also “bury their
weapons of war, according as their
brethren had, and they began to be
a righteous people; and they did
walk in the ways of the Lord, and
did observe to keep his command-
ments and his statutes.

15 Yea, and they did keep the law
of Moses; for it was expedient that
they should keep the law of Moses
as yet, for it was not all fulfilled. But
notwithstanding the “law of Moses,
they did look forward to the coming
of Christ, considering that the law
of Moses was a “type of his coming,
and believing that they must keep
those ‘outward “performances until
the time that he should be revealed
unto them.

16 Now they did not suppose
that ‘salvation came by the "law
of Moses; but the law of Moses did
serve to strengthen their faith in
Christ; and thus they did retain a
‘hope through faith, unto eternal
salvation, relying upon the spirit
of prophecy, which spake of those
things to come.

17 And now behold, Ammon, and
Aaron, and Omner, and Himni,
and their brethren did rejoice ex-
ceedingly, for the success which
they had had among the Laman-
ites, seeing that the Lord had
granted unto them according to
their ¢prayers, and that he had also

 

272

verified his word unto them in every
particular.

CHAPTER 26

Ammon glories in the Lord—The
faithful are strengthened by the Lord
and are given knowledge—By faith
men may bring thousands of souls
unto repentance—God has all power
and comprehends all things. About
90-77 B.C.

AND now, these are the words of
Ammon to his brethren, which say
thus: My brothers and my brethren,
behold I say unto you, how great
reason have we to rejoice; for could
we have supposed when we “started
from the land of Zarahemla that
God would have granted unto us
such great blessings?

2 And now, Lask, what great bless-
ings has he bestowed upon us? Can
ye tell?

3 Behold, I answer for you; for
our brethren, the Lamanites, were
in darkness, yea, even in the dark-
est abyss, but behold, how “many
of them are brought to behold the
marvelous light of God! And this is
the blessing which hath been be-
stowed upon us, that we have been
made “instruments in the hands
of God to bring about this great
work.

4 Behold, “thousands of them do
rejoice, and have been brought into
the fold of God.

5 Behold, the “field was ripe, and
blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in
the "sickle, and did reap with your
might, yea, all the day long did ye
labor; and behold the number of
your ‘sheaves! And they shall be

gathered into the garners, that they
are not wasted.

6 Yea, they shall not be beaten
down by the storm at the last day;
yea, neither shall they be harrowed
up by the whirlwinds; but when the
4storm cometh they shall be gath-
ered together in their place, that
the storm cannot penetrate to them;
yea, neither shall they be driven
with fierce winds whithersoever
the enemy listeth to carry them.

7 But behold, they are in the hands
of the Lord of the “harvest, and they
are his; and he will ’raise them up
at the last day.

8 “Blessed be the name of our God;
let us sing to his praise, yea, let us
give ‘thanks to his holy name, for
he doth work righteousness forever.

9 For if we had not come up out
of the land of Zarahemla, these
our dearly beloved brethren, who
have so dearly beloved us, would
still have been racked with “hatred
against us, yea, and they would also
have been °strangers to God.

10 And it came to pass that when
Ammon had said these words, his
brother Aaron rebuked him, saying:
Ammon, I fear that thy joy doth
carry thee away unto boasting.

11 But Ammon said unto him: I
do not “boast in my own strength,
nor in my own wisdom; but behold,
my joy is full, yea, my heart is
brim with ‘joy, and I will rejoice in
my God.

12 Yea, I know that I am ¢noth-
ing; as to my strength I am weak;
therefore I will "not boast of myself,
but I will “boast of my God, for in

 

ALMA 26:6-18

his ¢strength I can do all ‘things;
yea, behold, many mighty mira-
cles we have wrought in this land,
for which we will praise his name
forever.

13 Behold, how many thousands of
our brethren has he loosed from the
pains of “hell; and they are brought
to ’sing redeeming love, and this
because of the power of his word
which is in us, therefore have we
not great reason to rejoice?

14 Yea, we have reason to praise
him forever, for he is the Most High
God, and has loosed our brethren
from the “chains of hell.

15 Yea, they were encircled about
with everlasting “darkness and
destruction; but behold, he has
brought them into his everlasting
‘light, yea, into everlasting salvation;
and they are encircled about with
the matchless bounty of his love;
yea, and we have been instruments
in his hands of doing this great
and marvelous work.

16 Therefore, let us “glory, yea,
we will ’glory in the Lord; yea, we
will rejoice, for our joy is full; yea,
we will praise our God forever. Be-
hold, who can glory too much in the
Lord? Yea, who can say too much of
his great power, and of his ‘mercy,
and of his long-suffering towards
the children of men? Behold, I say
unto you, I cannot say the smallest
part which I feel.

17 Who could have supposed that
our God would have been so merci-
ful as to have snatched us from our
awful, sinful, and “polluted state?

wrath, with mighty threatenings to
*destroy his church.

19 Oh then, why did he not con-
sign us to an awful destruction, yea,
why did he not let the sword of his
justice fall upon us, and doom us
to eternal “despair?

20 Oh, my soul, almost as it were,
fleeth at the thought. Behold, he did
not exercise his justice upon us, but
in his great mercy hath brought us
over that everlasting “gulf of death
and misery, even to the salvation
of our souls.

21 And now behold, my brethren,
what “natural man is there that
knoweth these things? I say unto
you, there is "none that “‘knoweth
these things, save it be the penitent.

22 Yea, he that “repenteth and ex-
erciseth faith, and bringeth forth
good ’works, and prayeth contin-
ually without ceasing—unto such
it is given to know the ‘mysteries
of God; yea, unto such it shall be
49iven to ‘reveal things which never
have been revealed; yea, and it
shall be given unto such to bring
thousands of souls to repentance,
even as it has been given unto
us to bring these our brethren to
repentance.

23 Now do ye remember, my breth-
ren, that we said unto our brethren
in the land of Zarahemla, we go up
to the land of Nephi, to preach unto
our brethren, the Lamanites, and
they “laughed us to scorn?

24 For they said unto us: Do ye sup-
pose that ye can bring the Laman-
ites to the knowledge of the truth?
Do ye suppose that ye can convince
the Lamanites of the “incorrectness
of the *traditions of their fathers,

 

274

as ‘stiffnecked a people as they are;
whose hearts delight in the ¢shed-
ding of blood; whose days have
been spent in the grossest iniquity;
whose ways have been the ways of
a transgressor from the beginning?
Now my brethren, ye remember that
this was their language.

25 And moreover they did say: Let
us take up arms against them, that
we destroy them and their iniquity
out of the land, lest they overrun
us and destroy us.

26 But behold, my beloved breth-
ren, we came into the wilderness
not with the intent to destroy our
brethren, but with the intent that
perhaps we might save some few
of their souls.

27 Now when our hearts were de-
pressed, and we were about to “turn
back, behold, the Lord "comforted
us, and said: Go amongst thy breth-
ren, the Lamanites, and bear with
‘patience thine ¢afflictions, and I
will give unto you success.

28 And now behold, we have come,
and been forth amongst them; and
we have been patient in our suffer-
ings, and we have suffered every pri-
vation; yea, we have traveled from
house to house, relying upon the
mercies of the world—not upon
the mercies of the world alone but
upon the mercies of God.

29 And we have entered into their
houses and taught them, and we
have taught them in their streets;
yea, and we have taught them upon
their hills; and we have also entered
into their temples and their “syna-
gogues and taught them; and we
have been cast out, and mocked,
and spit upon, and smote upon our

cheeks; and we have been °’stoned,
and taken and bound with ‘strong
cords, and cast into prison; and
through the power and wisdom of
God we have been delivered again.

30 And we have suffered all manner
of afflictions, and all this, that per-
haps we might be the means of sav-
ing some soul; and we supposed that
our “joy would be full if perhaps we
could be the means of saving some.

31 Now behold, we can look forth
and see the “fruits of our labors; and
are they few? I say unto you, Nay,
they are "many; yea, and we can
witness of their sincerity, because
of their love towards their brethren
and also towards us.

32 For behold, they had rather
4sacrifice their lives than even to
take the life of their enemy; and
they have "buried their weapons of
war deep in the earth, because of
their love towards their brethren.

33 And now behold I say unto you,
has there been so great love in all
the land? Behold, I say unto you,
Nay, there has not, even among the
Nephites.

34 For behold, they would take
up arms against their brethren;
they would not suffer themselves
to be slain. But behold how “many
of these have laid down their lives;
and we know that they have gone
to their God, because of their love
and of their hatred to sin.

35 Now have we not reason to
rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there
never were men that had so great
reason to rejoice as we, since the
world began; yea, and my joy is
carried away, even unto boasting
in my God; for he has all “power,
ball wisdom, and all understanding;
he comprehendeth all things, and

 

ALMA 26:30-27:2

he is a “merciful Being, even unto
salvation, to those who will repent
and believe on his name.

36 Now if this is “boasting, even so
will I boast; for this is my life and
my light, my joy and my salvation,
and my redemption from everlast-
ing wo. Yea, blessed is the name
of my God, who has been mindful of
this people, who are a "branch of the
tree of Israel, and has been ‘lost
from its body in a strange land; yea,
I say, blessed be the name of my
God, who has been mindful of us,
4wanderers in a strange land.

37 Now my brethren, we see that
God is “mindful of every "people,
whatsoever land they may be in;
yea, he numbereth his people, and
his bowels of mercy are over all the
earth. Now this is my joy, and my
great thanksgiving; yea, and I will
give thanks unto my God forever.
Amen.

CHAPTER 27

The Lord commands Ammon to lead
the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi to safety—
Upon meeting Alma, Ammon’s joy
exhausts his strength—The Nephites
give the Anti-Nephi-Lehies the land of
Jershon—They are called the people of
Ammon. About 90-77 B.C.

Now it came to pass that when
those Lamanites who had gone
to war against the Nephites had
found, after their “many struggles
to destroy them, that it was in vain
to seek their destruction, they re-
turned again to the land of Nephi.

2 And it came to pass that the
Amalekites, because of their loss,
were exceedingly angry. And when
they saw that they could not seek
revenge from the Nephites, they be-
gan to “stir up the people in anger

against their "brethren, the people
of ‘Anti-Nephi-Lehi; therefore they
began again to destroy them.

3 Now this people “again refused to
take their arms, and they suffered
themselves to be slain according to
the desires of their enemies.

4 Now when Ammon and his breth-
ren saw this work of destruction
among those whom they so dearly
beloved, and among those who had
so dearly beloved them—for they
were treated as though they were
angels sent from God to save them
from everlasting destruction—
therefore, when Ammon and his
brethren saw this great work of
destruction, they were moved with
compassion, and they “said unto
the king:

5 Let us gather together this peo-
ple of the Lord, and let us go down
to the land of Zarahemla to our
brethren the Nephites, and flee out
of the hands of our enemies, that
we be not destroyed.

6 But the king said unto them: Be-
hold, the Nephites will destroy us,
because of the many murders and
sins we have committed against
them.

7 And Ammon said: I will go and
inquire of the Lord, and if he say
unto us, go down unto our breth-
ren, will ye go?

8 And the king said unto him: Yea,
if the Lord saith unto us go, we will
go down unto our brethren, and
we will be their slaves until we re-
pair unto them the many murders
and sins which we have committed
against them.

9 But Ammon said unto him: It
is against the law of our brethren,
which was established by my father,
that there should be any “slaves
among them; therefore let us go
down and rely upon the mercies
of our brethren.

 

276

10 But the king said unto him: In-
quire of the Lord, and if he saith
unto us go, we will go; otherwise
we will perish in the land.

11 And it came to pass that Am-
mon went and inquired of the Lord,
and the Lord said unto him:

12 Get this people “out of this
land, that they perish not; for Sa-
tan has great hold on the hearts of
the Amalekites, who do stir up the
Lamanites to anger against their
brethren to slay them; therefore get
thee out of this land; and blessed
are this people in this generation,
for I will *preserve them.

13 And now it came to pass that
Ammon went and told the king all
the words which the Lord had said
unto him.

14 And they gathered together all
their people, yea, all the people of
the Lord, and did gather together
all their flocks and herds, and de-
parted out of the land, and came
into the wilderness which divided
the land of Nephi from the land of
Zarahemla, and came over near the
borders of the land.

15 And it came to pass that Am-
mon said unto them: Behold, I and
my brethren will go forth into the
land of Zarahemla, and ye shall re-
main here until we return; and we
will “try the hearts of our brethren,
whether they will that ye shall come
into their land.

16 And it came to pass that as
Ammon was going forth into the
land, that he and his brethren met
Alma, over in the “place of which
has been spoken; and behold, this
was a joyful meeting.

17 Now the “joy of Ammon was
so great even that he was full; yea,
he was swallowed up in the joy of
his God, even to the "exhausting
of his strength; and he fell ‘again
to the earth.

18 Now was not this “exceed-
ing joy? Behold, this is joy which
none receiveth save it be the truly
penitent and humble seeker of
*happiness.

19 Now the joy of Alma in meeting
his “brethren was truly great, and
also the joy of Aaron, of Omner, and
Himni; but behold their joy was not
that to exceed their strength.

20 And now it came to pass that
Alma conducted his brethren back
to the land of Zarahemla; even to
his “own house. And they went and
told the ’chief judge all the things
that had happened unto them in
the land of Nephi, among their
brethren, the Lamanites.

21 And it came to pass that the
chief judge sent a proclamation
throughout all the land, desiring
the voice of the people concern-
ing the admitting their brethren,
who were the people of “Anti-
Nephi-Lehi.

22 And it came to pass that the
voice of the people came, saying:
Behold, we will give up the “land of
>Jershon, which is on the east by the
sea, which joins the land Bountiful,
which is on the south of the land
Bountiful; and this land Jershon is
the land which we will give unto
our brethren for an inheritance.

23 And behold, we will set our
armies between the land Jershon
and the land Nephi, that we may
“protect our brethren in the land
Jershon; and this we do for our
brethren, on account of their
fear to take up arms against their
brethren lest they should commit
sin; and this their great fear came
because of their sore repentance
which they had, on account of their
many murders and their awful
wickedness.

24 And now behold, this will we

 

ALMA 27:18-29

do unto our brethren, that they
may inherit the land Jershon; and
we will guard them from their en-
emies with our armies, on condition
that they will give us a “portion of
their substance to assist us that we
may maintain our armies.

25 Now, it came to pass that when
Ammon had heard this, he returned
to the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi,
and also Alma with him, into the
wilderness, where they had pitched
their tents, and made known unto
them all these things. And Alma
also related unto them his ¢conver-
sion, with Ammon and Aaron, and
his brethren.

26 And it came to pass that it did
cause great joy among them. And
they went down into the land of
Jershon, and took possession of
the land of Jershon; and they were
called by the Nephites the “people
of Ammon; therefore they were
distinguished by that name ever
after.

27 And they were among the peo-
ple of Nephi, and also numbered
among the people who were of the
church of God. And they were also
distinguished for their “zeal towards
God, and also towards men; for they
were perfectly "honest and upright
in all things; and they were ‘firm
in the faith of Christ, even unto
the end.

28 And they did look upon shed-
ding the blood of their brethren
with the greatest abhorrence; and
they never could be prevailed upon
to take up arms against their breth-
ren; and they never did look upon
death with any degree of terror, for
their hope and views of Christ and
the resurrection; therefore, death
was swallowed up to them by the
victory of Christ over it.

29 Therefore, they would suffer

“death in the most aggravating and

inflicted by their brethren, before
they would take the sword or cime-
ter to smite them.

30 And thus they were a zealous
and beloved people, a highly fa-
vored people of the Lord.

CHAPTER 28

The Lamanites are defeated in a tre-
mendous battle—Tens of thousands
are slain—The wicked are consigned
to a state of endless woe; the righteous
attain a never-ending happiness. About
77-76 B.C.

AND now it came to pass that after
the people of Ammon were estab-
lished in the land of “Jershon, and
a church also established in the
land of Jershon, and the armies of
the Nephites were set round about
the land of Jershon, yea, in all the
borders round about the land of
Zarahemla; behold the armies of
the Lamanites had followed their
brethren into the wilderness,

2 And thus there was a tremen-
dous battle; yea, even such an one
as never had been known among
all the people in the land from the
time Lehi left Jerusalem; yea, and
tens of thousands of the Lamanites
were slain and scattered abroad.

3 Yea, and also there was a tremen-
dous slaughter among the people of
Nephi; nevertheless, the Lamanites
were “driven and scattered, and the
people of Nephi returned again to
their land.

4 And now this was a time that
there was a great “mourning and
lamentation heard throughout all
the land, among all the people of
Nephi—

5 Yea, the cry of “widows mourn-
ing for their husbands, and also of
fathers mourning for their sons,

 

278

and the daughter for the brother,
yea, the brother for the father;
and thus the cry of mourning was
heard among all of them, mourn-
ing for their kindred who had
been slain.

6 And now surely this was a sor-
rowful day; yea, a time of solem-
nity, and a time of much “fasting
and prayer.

7 And thus endeth the fifteenth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi;

8 And “this is the account of Am-
mon and his brethren, their jour-
neyings in the land of Nephi, their
sufferings in the land, their sorrows,
and their afflictions, and their *in-
comprehensible joy, and the recep-
tion and safety of the brethren in
the land of Jershon. And now may
the Lord, the Redeemer of all men,
bless their souls forever.

9 And this is the account of the
wars and contentions among the
Nephites, and also the wars between
the Nephites and the Lamanites;
and the fifteenth year of the reign
of the judges is ended.

10 And from the “first year to the
fifteenth has brought to pass the
destruction of many thousand lives;
yea, it has brought to pass an awful
scene of bloodshed.

11 And the bodies of many thou-
sands are laid low in the earth,
while the bodies of many thousands
are *moldering in heaps upon the
face of the earth; yea, and many
thousands are "mourning for the
loss of their kindred, because they
have reason to fear, according to the
promises of the Lord, that they are
consigned to a state of endless wo.

12 While many thousands of others
truly “mourn for the loss of their
kindred, yet they rejoice and exult
in the hope, and even Know, accord-
ing to the °promises of the Lord, that

they are raised to dwell at the right
hand of God, in a state of never-
ending ‘happiness.

13 And thus we see how great
the inequality of man is because
of sin and transgression, and the
power of the devil, which comes
by the cunning ‘plans which he
hath devised to ensnare the hearts
of men.

14 And thus we see the great call
of “diligence of men to labor in the
vineyards of the Lord; and thus we
see the great reason of sorrow, and
also of rejoicing—sorrow because
of death and destruction among
men, and joy because of the "light
of Christ unto life.

CHAPTER 29

Alma desires to cry repentance with an-
gelic zeal—The Lord grants teachers for
all nations—Alma glories in the Lord’s
work and in the success of Ammon and
his brethren. About 76 B.c.

O THAT I were an angel, and could
have the wish of mine heart, that I
might go forth and speak with the
“trump of God, with a voice to shake
the earth, and cry repentance unto
every people!

2 Yea, I would declare unto every
soul, as with the voice of thunder,
repentance and the plan of redemp-
tion, that they should repent and
“come unto our God, that there
might not be more sorrow upon all
the face of the earth.

3 But behold, Iam a man, and do
sin in my wish; for I ought to be
content with the things which the
Lord hath allotted unto me.

4 1 ought not to harrow up in my
desires the firm decree of a just God,

 

ALMA 28:13-29:10

for 1 Know that he granteth unto men
according to their “desire, whether
it be unto death or unto life; yea,
I know that he allotteth unto men,
yea, decreeth unto them decrees
which are unalterable, according to
their ’wills, whether they be unto
salvation or unto destruction.

5 Yea, and I know that good and
evil have come before all men; he
that knoweth not good from evil is
“blameless; but he that °knoweth
good and evil, to him it is given ac-
cording to his desires, whether he
desireth good or evil, life or death,
joy or remorse of ‘conscience.

6 Now, seeing that I know these
things, why should I desire more
than to “perform the work to which
I have been called?

7 Why should I desire that I were
an angel, that I could speak unto
all the ends of the earth?

8 For behold, the Lord doth “grant
unto ’all nations, of their own na-
tion and ‘tongue, to teach his word,
yea, in wisdom, all that he ¢seeth
fit that they should have; therefore
we see that the Lord doth counsel
in wisdom, according to that which
is just and true.

9 L know that which the Lord hath
commanded me, and I glory in it.
I do “not °glory of myself, but I
glory in that which the Lord hath
commanded me; yea, and this is
my glory, that perhaps I may be an
instrument in the hands of God to
bring some soul to repentance; and
this is my joy.

10 And behold, when I see many
of my brethren truly penitent, and
coming to the Lord their God, then
is my soul filled with joy; then do I
remember “what the Lord has done

for me, yea, even that he hath heard
my prayer; yea, then do I remem-
ber his merciful arm which he ex-
tended towards me.

11 Yea, and I also remember the
captivity of my fathers; for I surely
do Know that the “Lord did deliver
them out of bondage, and by this
did establish his church; yea, the
Lord God, the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob, did deliver them out of
bondage.

12 Yea, I have always remembered
the captivity of my fathers; and that
same God who “delivered them out
of the hands of the Egyptians did
deliver them out of bondage.

13 Yea, and that same God did es-
tablish his church among them; yea,
and that same God hath called me
by a “holy calling, to "preach the
word unto this people, and hath
given me much success, in the which
my joy is full.

14 But I do not joy in my own
4success alone, but my joy is more
full because of the success of my
brethren, who have been up to the
land of Nephi.

15 Behold, they have labored ex-
ceedingly, and have brought forth
much fruit; and how great shall be
their reward!

16 Now, when I think of the suc-
cess of these my brethren my soul
is carried away, even to the separa-
tion of it from the body, as it were,
so great is my “joy.

17 And now may God grant unto
these, my brethren, that they may
sit down in the kingdom of God; yea,
and also all those who are the fruit
of their labors that they may go no
more out, but that they may praise
him forever. And may God grant
that it may be done according to
my words, even as I have spoken.
Amen.

CHAPTER 30

Korihor, the anti-Christ, ridicules Christ,
the Atonement, and the spirit of proph-
ecy—He teaches that there isno God, no
fall of man, no penalty for sin, and no
Christ—Alma testifies that Christ will
come and that all things denote there is
a God—Korihor demands a sign and is
struck dumb—The devil had appeared
to Korihor as an angel and taught him
what to say—Korihor is trodden down
and dies. About 76-74 B.c.

BEHOLD, now it came to pass that
after the “people of Ammon were
established in the land of Jershon,
yea, and also after the Lamanites
were *driven out of the land, and
their dead were buried by the peo-
ple of the land—

2 Now their dead were not num-
bered because of the greatness of
their numbers; neither were the dead
of the Nephites numbered—but it
came to pass after they had buried
their dead, and also after the days of
“fasting, and "mourning, and prayer,
(and it was in the sixteenth year of
the reign of the judges over the peo-
ple of Nephi) there began to be con-
tinual peace throughout all the land.

3 Yea, and the people did observe
to keep the commandments of the
Lord; and they were strict in ob-
serving the “ordinances of God,
according to the law of Moses; for
they were taught to "keep the law
of Moses until it should be fulfilled.

4 And thus the people did have
no disturbance in all the sixteenth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi.

5 And it came to pass that in the
commencement of the seventeenth
year of the reign of the judges, there
was continual peace.

6 But it came to pass in the latter
end of the seventeenth year, there
came a man into the land of

Zarahemla, and he was “Anti-Christ,
for he began to preach unto the peo-
ple 'against the prophecies which
had been spoken by the prophets,
concerning the coming of Christ.

7 Now there was no law against a
“man’s “belief; for it was strictly con-
trary to the commands of God that
there should be a law which should
bring men on to unequal grounds.

8 For thus saith the scripture:
*Choose ye this day, whom ye will
serve.

9 Now if a man desired to serve
God, it was his privilege; or rather,
if he believed in God it was his priv-
ilege to serve him; but if he did not
believe in him there was no law to
punish him.

10 But if he “murdered he was
punished unto °death; and if he
‘robbed he was also punished; and
if he stole he was also punished;
and if he committed “adultery he
was also punished; yea, for all this
wickedness they were punished.

11 For there was a law that men
should be judged according to their
crimes. Nevertheless, there was no
law against a man’s belief; therefore,
a man was punished only for the
crimes which he had done; therefore
all men were on “equal grounds.

12 And this “Anti-Christ, whose
name was Korihor, (and the law
could have no hold upon him) be-
gan to preach unto the people that
there should be 'no Christ. And after
this manner did he preach, saying:

13 O ye that are bound down un-
der a “foolish and a vain hope, why
do ye yoke yourselves with such
foolish things? Why do ye look for
a Christ? For no man can ’know of
anything which is to come.

14 Behold, these things which ye

 

ALMA 30:7-20

call prophecies, which ye say are
handed down by holy prophets,
behold, they are foolish traditions
of your fathers.

15 How do ye know of their surety?
Behold, ye cannot know of things
which ye do not “see; therefore ye
cannot Know that there shall be a
Christ.

16 Ye look forward and say that
ye see a remission of your sins. But
behold, it is the effect of a “frenzied
mind; and this derangement of your
minds comes because of the tradi-
tions of your fathers, which lead
you away into a belief of things
which are not so.

17 And many more such things
did he say unto them, telling them
that there could be no atonement
made for the sins of men, but every
man “fared in this life according to
the management of the creature;
therefore every man prospered
according to his genius, and that
every man conquered according
to his strength; and whatsoever a
man did was ‘no crime.

18 And thus he did preach unto
them, leading away the hearts of
many, causing them to lift up their
heads in their wickedness, yea, lead-
ing away many women, and also
men, to commit whoredoms—telling
them that when a man was dead,
that was the end thereof.

19 Now this man went over to the
land of “Jershon also, to preach
these things among the people of
Ammon, who were once the people
of the Lamanites.

20 But behold they were more wise
than many of the Nephites; for they
took him, and bound him, and car-
ried him before Ammon, who was
a *high priest over that people.

21 And it came to pass that he
caused that he should be carried
out of the land. And he came over
into the land of Gideon, and began
to preach unto them also; and here
he did not have much success, for he
was taken and bound and carried
before the high priest, and also the
chief judge over the land.

22 And it came to pass that the
high priest said unto him: Why do
ye go about perverting the ways
of the Lord? Why do ye teach this
people that there shall be no Christ,
to interrupt their rejoicings? Why
do ye speak against all the prophe-
cies of the holy prophets?

23 Now the high priest’s name was
Giddonah. And Korihor said unto
him: Because I do not teach the
foolish traditions of your fathers,
and because I do not teach this peo-
ple to bind themselves down under
the foolish ordinances and perfor-
mances which are laid down by
ancient priests, to usurp power and
authority over them, to keep them
in ignorance, that they may not
lift up their heads, but be brought
down according to thy words.

24 Ye say that this people is a
free people. Behold, I say they are
in bondage. Ye say that those an-
cient prophecies are true. Behold,
I say that ye do not know that they
are true.

25 Ye say that this people is a guilty
and a fallen people, because of the
transgression of a parent. Behold,
I say that a child is not guilty be-
cause of its parents.

26 And ye also say that Christ
shall come. But behold, I say that
ye do not Know that there shall bea
Christ. And ye say also that he shall
be slain for the “sins of the world—

27 And thus ye lead away this
people after the foolish traditions
of your fathers, and according to
your own desires; and ye keep them

 

282

down, even as it were in bondage,
that ye may glut yourselves with
the labors of their hands, that they
durst not look up with boldness,
and that they durst not enjoy their
rights and privileges.

28 Yea, they durst not make use
of that which is their own lest they
should offend their priests, who do
yoke them according to their desires,
and have brought them to believe,
by their traditions and their dreams
and their whims and their visions
and their pretended mysteries,
that they should, if they did not do
according to their words, offend
some unknown being, who they
say is God—a being who “never has
been seen or known, who ’never
was nor ever will be.

29 Now when the high priest and
the “chief judge saw the hardness
of his heart, yea, when they saw
that he would ’revile even against
God, they would not make any reply
to his words; but they caused that
he should be bound; and they de-
livered him up into the hands of
the officers, and sent him to the
land of Zarahemla, that he might
be brought before Alma, and the
chief judge who was governor over
all the land.

30 And it came to pass that when
he was brought before Alma and
the chief judge, he did go on in
the same manner as he did in the
land of Gideon; yea, he went on to
“*blaspheme.

31 And he did rise up in great
*swelling words before Alma, and
did revile against the priests and
teachers, accusing them of leading
away the people after the silly tradi-
tions of their fathers, for the sake of
glutting on the labors of the people.

32 Now Alma said unto him: Thou
knowest that we do not glut our-
selves upon the labors of this people;
for behold I have “labored even from

the commencement of the reign of
the judges until now, with mine
’own hands for my support, notwith-
standing my many travels round
about the land to declare the word
of God unto my people.

33 And notwithstanding the many
labors which I have performed in
the church, I have never received
so much as even one “senine for my
labor; neither has any of my breth-
ren, save it were in the judgment-
seat; and then we have received
only according to law for our time.

34 And now, if we do not receive
anything for our labors in the
church, what doth it profit us to
labor in the church save it were to
declare the truth, that we may have
rejoicings in the “joy of our brethren?

35 Then why sayest thou that we
preach unto this people to get gain,
when thou, of thyself, knowest that
we receive no gain? And now, be-
lievest thou that we deceive this
people, that *causes such joy in
their hearts?

36 And Korihor answered him, Yea.

37 And then Alma said unto him:
Believest thou that there is a God?

38 And he answered, Nay.

39 Now Alma said unto him: Will ye
deny again that there is a God, and
also deny the Christ? For behold, I
say unto you, I know there is a God,
and also that Christ shall come.

40 And now what evidence have ye
that there is no “God, or that Christ
cometh not? I say unto you that ye
have none, save it be your word only.

41 But, behold, I have all things as
a “testimony that these things are
true; and ye also have all things
as a testimony unto you that they
are true; and will ye deny them?

 

ALMA 30:33-47

Believest thou that these things
are true?

42 Behold, I know that thou ¢be-
lievest, but thou art possessed with
a lying spirit, and ye have put
‘off the Spirit of God that it may
have no place in you; but the devil
has power over you, and he doth
carry you about, working devices
that he may destroy the children
of God.

43 And now Korihor said unto
Alma: If thou wilt show me a 4sign,
that I may be convinced that there
is a God, yea, show unto me that he
hath power, and then will I be con-
vinced of the truth of thy words.

44 But Alma said unto him: Thou
hast had signs enough; will ye tempt
your God? Will ye say, Show unto
me a sign, when ye have the tes-
timony of “all these thy brethren,
and also all the holy prophets? The
scriptures are laid before thee, yea,
and all things denote there is a
God; yea, even the ’earth, and ‘all
things that are upon the face of it,
yea, and its “motion, yea, and also
all the ‘planets which move in their
regular form do witness that there
is a Supreme Creator.

45 And yet do ye go about, lead-
ing away the hearts of this people,
testifying unto them there is no
God? And yet will ye deny against
all these “witnesses? And he said:
Yea, I will deny, except ye shall show
me a sign.

46 And now it came to pass that
Alma said unto him: Behold, I am
grieved because of the hardness of
your heart, yea, that ye will still re-
sist the spirit of the truth, that thy
soul may be destroyed.

47 But behold, it is “better that thy

soul should be *lost than that thou
shouldst be the means of bringing
many souls down to destruction,
by thy lying and by thy flattering
words; therefore if thou shalt deny
again, behold God shall smite thee,
that thou shalt become dumb, that
thou shalt never open thy mouth
any more, that thou shalt not de-
ceive this people any more.

48 Now Korihor said unto him: 1 do
not deny the existence of a God, but
Ido not believe that there is a God;
and I say also, that ye do not know
that there is a God; and except ye
show me a sign, I will not believe.

49 Now Alma said unto him: This
willl give unto thee for a sign, that
thou shalt be “struck dumb, accord-
ing to my words; and I say, that in
the name of God, ye shall be struck
dumb, that ye shall no more have
utterance.

50 Now when Alma had said these
words, Korihor was struck dumb,
that he could not have utterance,
according to the words of Alma.

51 And now when the chief judge
saw this, he put forth his hand and
wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art thou
convinced of the power of God?
In whom did ye desire that Alma
should show forth his sign? Would
ye that he should afflict others, to
show unto thee a sign? Behold, he
has showed unto you a sign; and
now will ye dispute more?

52 And Korihor put forth his hand
and wrote, saying: I know that I
am dumb, for I cannot speak; and
I know that nothing save it were
the “power of God could bring this
upon me; yea, and I always ’knew
that there was a God.

53 But behold, the devil hath
“deceived me; for he ‘appeared
unto me in the ‘form of an angel,
and said unto me: Go and reclaim
this people, for they have all gone

 

284

astray after an unknown God. And
he said unto me: There is “no God;
yea, and he taught me that which
I should say. And I have taught his
words; and I taught them because
they were pleasing unto the ¢car-
nal mind; and I taught them, even
until I had much success, insomuch
that I verily believed that they were
true; and for this cause I withstood
the truth, even until I have brought
this great ‘curse upon me.

54 Now when he had said this, he
besought that Alma should pray
unto God, that the “curse might be
taken from him.

55 But Alma said unto him: If this
curse should be taken from thee thou
wouldst again lead away the hearts
of this people; therefore, it shall
be unto thee even as the Lord will.

56 And it came to pass that the
curse was not taken off of Kori-
hor; but he was “cast out, and went
about from house to house begging
for his food.

57 Now the knowledge of what
had happened unto Korihor was
immediately published throughout
all the land; yea, the proclamation
was sent forth by the chief judge to
all the people in the land, declar-
ing unto those who had believed
in the words of Korihor that they
must speedily repent, “lest the same
judgments would come unto them.

58 And it came to pass that they
were all convinced of the wicked-
ness of Korihor; therefore they were
all converted again unto the Lord;
and this put an end to the iniquity
after the manner of Korihor. And
Korihor did go about from house to
house, begging food for his support.

59 And it came to pass that as he
went forth among the people, yea,
among a people who had separated
themselves from the Nephites and
called themselves “Zoramites, being

led by a man whose name was
Zoram—and as he went forth
amongst them, behold, he was run
upon and trodden down, even until
he was ’dead.

60 And thus we see the end of
him who “perverteth the ways of
the Lord; and thus we see that the
devil will not "support his children
at the last day, but doth speedily
drag them down to ‘hell.

CHAPTER 31

Alma heads a mission to reclaim the
apostate Zoramites—The Zoramites
deny Christ, believe in a false con-
cept of election, and worship with set
prayers—The missionaries are filled
with the Holy Spirit—Their afflictions
are swallowed up in the joy of Christ.
About 74 B.c.

Now it came to pass that after the end
of Korihor, Alma having received
tidings that the Zoramites were per-
verting the ways of the Lord, and
that Zoram, who was their leader,
was leading the hearts of the peo-
ple to “bow down to dumb “idols,
his heart again began to ‘sicken be-
cause of the iniquity of the people.

2 For it was the cause of great “sor-
row to Alma to know of iniquity
among his people; therefore his
heart was exceedingly "sorrowful
because of the separation of the
Zoramites from the Nephites.

3 Now the Zoramites had gath-
ered themselves together in a land
which they called “Antionum, which
was east of the land of Zarahemla,
which lay nearly bordering upon the

 

ALMA 30:60-31:9

seashore, which was south of the land
of *Jershon, which also bordered
upon the wilderness south, which
wilderness was full of the Lamanites.

4 Now the Nephites greatly feared
that the Zoramites would enter into
a “correspondence with the La-
manites, and that it would be the
means of great loss on the part of
the Nephites.

5 And now, as the “preaching of
the ’word had a great tendency to
‘lead the people to do that which
was just—yea, it had had more pow-
erful effect upon the minds of the
people than the sword, or anything
else, which had happened unto
them—therefore Alma thought it
was expedient that they should try
the virtue of the word of God.

6 Therefore he took Ammon, and
Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he
did leave in the church in Zara-
hemla; but the former three he
took with him, and also “Amulek
and Zeezrom, who were at Melek;
and he also took two of his sons.

7 Now the eldest of his sons he
took not with him, and his name
was Helaman; but the names of
those whom he took with him were
*Shiblon and ’Corianton; and these
are the names of those who went
with him among the ‘Zoramites, to
preach unto them the word.

8 Now the Zoramites were “dis-
senters from the Nephites; there-
fore they had had the word of God
preached unto them.

9 But they had “fallen into great
errors, for they would not observe
to keep the commandments of God,

and his statutes, according to the
law of Moses.

10 Neither would they observe
the “performances of the church,
to continue in prayer and suppli-
cation to God daily, that they might
not enter into temptation.

11 Yea, in fine, they did pervert
the ways of the Lord in very many
instances; therefore, for this cause,
Alma and his brethren went into
the land to preach the word unto
them.

12 Now, when they had come into
the land, behold, to their astonish-
ment they found that the Zoram-
ites had built synagogues, and that
they did gather themselves together
on one day of the week, which day
they did call the day of the Lord;
and they did “worship after a man-
ner which Alma and his brethren
had never beheld;

13 For they had a place built up
in the center of their synagogue, a
place for standing, which was high
above the head; and the top thereof
would only admit one person.

14 Therefore, whosoever desired to
*worship must go forth and stand
upon the top thereof, and stretch
forth his hands towards heaven,
and cry with a loud voice, saying:

15 Holy, holy God; we believe that
thou art God, and we believe
that thou art holy, and that thou
wast a “spirit, and that thou arta
spirit, and that thou wilt be a spirit
forever.

16 Holy God, we believe that thou
hast separated us from our breth-
ren; and we do not believe in the
tradition of our brethren, which
was handed down to them by the
childishness of their fathers; but we
believe that thou hast “elected us
to be thy "holy children; and also
thou hast made it known unto us
that ‘there shall be “no Christ.

 

286

17 But thou art the same yesterday,
today, and forever; and thou hast
“elected us that we shall be saved,
whilst all around us are elected to
be cast by thy wrath down to hell;
for the which holiness, O God,
we thank thee; and we also thank
thee that thou hast elected us, that
we may not be led away after the
foolish traditions of our brethren,
which doth "bind them down to a
belief of Christ, which doth lead
their hearts to wander far from thee,
our God.

18 And again we thank thee, O
God, that we are a chosen and a
holy people. Amen.

19 Now it came to pass that after
Alma and his brethren and his sons
had heard these prayers, they were
astonished beyond all measure.

20 For behold, every man did
go forth and offer up these same
*prayers.

21 Now the place was called by
them Rameumptom, which, being
interpreted, is the holy stand.

22 Now, from this stand they did
offer up, every man, the selfsame
prayer unto God, thanking their
God that they were chosen of him,
and that he did not lead them away
after the tradition of their brethren,
and that their hearts were not stolen
away to believe in things to come,
which they knew nothing about.

23 Now, after the people had all
offered up thanks after this man-
ner, they returned to their homes,
“never speaking of their God again
until they had assembled themselves
together again to the holy stand, to
offer up thanks after their manner.

24 Now when Alma saw this his
heart was “grieved; for he saw that
they were a wicked and a perverse
people; yea, he saw that their hearts
were set upon gold, and upon silver,
and upon all manner of fine goods.

25 Yea, and he also saw that their
hearts were “lifted up unto great
boasting, in their pride.

26 And he lifted up his voice to
heaven, and “cried, saying: O, how
long, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that
thy servants shall dwell here below
in the flesh, to behold such gross
wickedness among the children of
men?

27 Behold, O God, they “cry unto
thee, and yet their hearts are swal-
lowed up in their pride. Behold, O
God, they cry unto thee with their
mouths, while they are "puffed up,
even to greatness, with the vain
things of the ‘world.

28 Behold, O my God, their costly
apparel, and their ringlets, and their
“bracelets, and their ornaments of
gold, and all their precious things
which they are ornamented with;
and behold, their hearts are set upon
them, and yet they cry unto thee
and say—We thank thee, O God, for
we are a chosen people unto thee,
while others shall perish.

29 Yea, and they say that thou hast
made it known unto them that there
shall be no Christ.

30 O Lord God, how long wilt thou
suffer that such wickedness and in-
fidelity shall be among this people?
O Lord, wilt thou give me strength,
that I may “bear with mine infir-
mities. For | am infirm, and such
wickedness among this people doth
pain my soul.

31 O Lord, my heart is exceedingly
sorrowful; wilt thou comfort my soul
*in Christ. O Lord, wilt thou grant
unto me that I may have strength,
that I may suffer with patience
these ’afflictions which shall come
upon me, because of the iniquity
of this people.

 

ALMA 31:25-38

32 O Lord, wilt thou comfort my
soul, and give unto me success, and
also my fellow laborers who are with
me—yea, Ammon, and Aaron, and
Omner, and also “Amulek and Zeez-
rom, and also my °two sons—yea,
even all these wilt thou comfort, O
Lord, Yea, wilt thou comfort their
souls in Christ.

33 Wilt thou grant unto them that
they may have strength, that they
may “bear their afflictions which
shall come upon them because of
the iniquities of this people.

34 O Lord, wilt thou grant “unto us
that we may have success in bring-
ing them again unto thee in Christ.

35 Behold, O Lord, their “souls are
precious, and many of them are
our brethren; therefore, give unto
us, O Lord, power and wisdom that
we may bring these, our brethren,
again unto thee.

36 Now it came to pass that when
Alma had said these words, that
he ‘clapped his "hands upon all
them who were with him. And be-
hold, as he clapped his hands upon
them, they were filled with the
Holy Spirit.

37 And after that they did sepa-
rate themselves one from another,
“taking no thought for themselves
what they should eat, or what they
should drink, or what they should
put on.

38 And the Lord provided for
them that they should hunger not,
neither should they thirst; yea,
and he also gave them strength,
that they should suffer no manner
of “afflictions, save it were swal-
lowed up in the joy of Christ. Now
this was according to the prayer of
Alma; and this because he prayed
in ’faith.,

CHAPTER 32

Alma teaches the poor whose afflictions
had humbled them—Faith is a hope in
that which is not seen which is true—
Alma testifies that angels minister to
men, women, and children—Alma com-
pares the word unto a seed—It must be
planted and nourished—Then it grows
into a tree from which the fruit of eter-
nal life is picked. About 74 B.C.

AND it came to pass that they did
go forth, and began to preach the
word of God unto the people, enter-
ing into their synagogues, and into
their houses; yea, and even they did
preach the word in their streets.

2 And it came to pass that after
much labor among them, they be-
gan to have success among the “poor
class of people; for behold, they
were cast out of the synagogues
because of the coarseness of their
apparel—

3 Therefore they were not permit-
ted to enter into their synagogues
to worship God, being esteemed
as filthiness; therefore they were
poor; yea, they were esteemed by
their brethren as “dross; therefore
they were "poor as to things of the
world; and also they were poor
in heart.

4 Now, as Alma was teaching and
speaking unto the people upon the
hill *Onidah, there came a great
’multitude unto him, who were
those of whom we have been speak-
ing, of whom were ‘poor in heart,
because of their poverty as to the
things of the world.

5 And they came unto Alma; and
the one who was the foremost among
them said unto him: Behold, ¢what
shall these my brethren do, for they
are 'despised of all men because of

 

288

their poverty, yea, and more espe-
cially by our priests; for they have
‘cast us out of our synagogues which
we have labored abundantly to build
with our own hands; and they have
cast us out because of our exceed-
ing poverty; and we have “no place
to worship our God; and behold,
‘what shall we do?

6 And now when Alma heard
this, he turned him about, his face
immediately towards him, and he
beheld with great joy; for he be-
held that their “afflictions had
truly "humbled them, and that
they were in a ‘preparation to hear
the word.

7 Therefore he did say no more to
the other multitude; but he stretched
forth his hand, and cried unto those
whom he beheld, who were truly
penitent, and said unto them:

81 behold that ye are “lowly in
heart; and if so, blessed are ye.

9 Behold thy brother hath said,
What shall we do?—for we are cast
out of our synagogues, that we can-
not worship our God.

10 Behold I say unto you, do ye
suppose that ye “cannot worship
God save it be in your synagogues
only?

11 And moreover, I would ask, do
ye suppose that ye must not worship
God only “once in a week?

12 [say unto you, it is well that ye
are cast out of your synagogues, that
ye may be humble, and that ye may
learn “wisdom; for it is necessary
that ye should learn wisdom; for
it is because that ye are cast out,
that ye are despised of your brethren
because of your exceeding "poverty,
that ye are brought to a lowliness of
heart; for ye are necessarily brought
to be humble.

13 And now, because ye are com-
pelled to be humble blessed are ye;
for a man sometimes, if he is com-
pelled to be humble, seeketh “repen-
tance; and now surely, whosoever
repenteth shall find mercy; and he
that findeth mercy and ’endureth
to the end the same shall be saved.

14 And now, as I said unto you,
that because ye were compelled
to be “humble ye were blessed, do
ye not suppose that they are more
blessed who truly humble them-
selves because of the word?

15 Yea, he that truly humbleth
himself, and repenteth of his sins,
and endureth to the end, the same
shall be blessed—yea, much more
blessed than they who are com-
pelled to be humble because of
their exceeding poverty.

16 Therefore, blessed are they who
“humble themselves without being
b’compelled to be humble; or rather,
in other words, blessed is he that
believeth in the word of God, and is
baptized without ‘stubbornness of
heart, yea, without being brought to
know the word, or even compelled
to know, before they will believe.

17 Yea, there are many who do say:
If thou wilt show unto us a “sign
from heaven, then we shall know
of a surety; then we shall believe.

18 Now Lask, is this faith? Behold,
I say unto you, Nay; for if a man
knoweth a thing he hath no cause
to “believe, for he knoweth it.

19 And now, how much ¢more
’cursed is he that ‘knoweth the
4will of God and doeth it not, than
he that only believeth, or only hath
cause to believe, and falleth into
"transgression?

20 Now of this thing ye must judge.

 

ALMA 32:13-27

Behold, I say unto you, that it is on
the one hand even as it is on the
other; and it shall be unto every
man according to his work.

21 And now as I said concerning
faith—*faith is not to have a per-
fect knowledge of things; therefore
if ye have faith ye "hope for things
which are ‘not seen, which are true.

22 And now, behold, I say unto
you, and I would that ye should re-
member, that God is “merciful unto
all who believe on his name; there-
fore he desireth, in the first place,
that ye should believe, yea, even
on his word.

23 And now, he imparteth his word
by angels unto men, yea, “not only
men but women also. Now this is not
all; little "children do have words
given unto them many times, which
‘confound the wise and the learned.

24 And now, my beloved brethren,
as ye have desired to know of me
what ye shall do because ye are af-
flicted and cast out—now I do not

I mean to judge you only according

25 ForI do not mean that ye all of
you have been compelled to hum-
ble yourselves; for I verily believe
that there are some among you who
“would humble themselves, let them
be in whatsoever circumstances
they might.

26 Now, as I said concerning faith—
that it was not a perfect knowl-
edge—even so it is with my words.
Ye cannot know of their surety at
first, unto perfection, any more
than faith is a perfect knowledge.

27 But behold, if ye will awake
and arouse your faculties, even to
an experiment upon my words, and

exercise a particle of faith, yea, even
if ye can no more than “desire to
believe, let this desire work in you,
even until ye believe in a manner
that ye can give place for a portion
of my words.

28 Now, we will compare the word
unto a “seed. Now, if ye give place,
that a "seed may be planted in your
‘heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or
a good seed, if ye do not cast it out
by your “unbelief, that ye will resist
the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will
begin to swell within your breasts;
and when you feel these swell-
ing motions, ye will begin to say
within yourselves—It must needs be
that this is a good seed, or that the
word is good, for it beginneth to en-
large my soul; yea, it beginneth to
‘enlighten my ‘understanding, yea,
it beginneth to be delicious to me.

29 Now behold, would not this in-
crease your faith? I say unto you,
Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown
up to a perfect knowledge.

30 But behold, as the seed swell-
eth, and sprouteth, and beginneth
to grow, then you must needs say
that the seed is good; for behold it
swelleth, and sprouteth, and begin-
neth to grow. And now, behold, will
not this strengthen your faith? Yea,
it will strengthen your faith: for ye
will say I know that this is a good
seed; for behold it sprouteth and
beginneth to grow.

31 And now, behold, are ye sure
that this is a good seed? I say unto
you, Yea; for every seed bringeth
forth unto its own “likeness.

32 Therefore, if a seed groweth it
is good, but if it groweth not, be-
hold it is not good, therefore it is
cast away.

33 And now, behold, because ye
have tried the experiment, and
planted the seed, and it swelleth

 

290

and sprouteth, and beginneth to
grow, ye must needs know that the
seed is good.

34 And now, behold, is your*knowl-
edge ’perfect? Yea, your knowledge
is perfect in that thing, and your
‘faith is dormant; and this because
you know, for ye know that the
word hath swelled your souls, and
ye also know that it hath sprouted
up, that your understanding doth
begin to be enlightened, and your
4mind doth begin to expand.

35 O then, is not this real? I say
unto you, Yea, because it is “light;
and whatsoever is light, is "good,
because it is discernible, therefore
ye must know that it is good; and
now behold, after ye have tasted
this light is your knowledge perfect?

36 Behold I say unto you, Nay; nei-
ther must ye lay aside your faith, for
ye have only exercised your faith
to plant the seed that ye might try
the experiment to know if the seed
was good.

37 And behold, as the tree begin-
neth to grow, ye will say: Let us
nourish it with great care, that it
may get root, that it may grow up,
and bring forth fruit unto us. And
now behold, if ye nourish it with
much care it will get root, and grow
up, and bring forth fruit.

38 But if ye “neglect the tree, and
take no thought for its nourishment,
behold it will not get any root; and
when the heat of the sun cometh
and scorcheth it, because it hath no
root it withers away, and ye pluck
it up and cast it out.

39 Now, this is not because the
seed was not good, neither is it be-
cause the fruit thereof would not
be desirable; but it is because your
“sround is barren, and ye will not
nourish the tree, therefore ye can-
not have the fruit thereof.

40 And thus, if ye will not nourish
the word, looking forward with an
eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye
can never pluck of the fruit of the
“tree of life.

41 But if ye will nourish the word,
yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth
to grow, by your faith with great
diligence, and with “patience, look-
ing forward to the fruit thereof, it
shall take root; and behold it shall
be a tree "springing up unto ever-
lasting life.

42 And because of your “diligence
and your faith and your patience
with the word in nourishing it, that
it may take root in you, behold, by
and by ye shall pluck the °fruit
thereof, which is most precious,
which is sweet above all that is
sweet, and which is white above all
that is white, yea, and pure above
all that is pure; and ye shall feast
upon this fruit even until ye are
filled, that ye hunger not, neither
shall ye thirst.

43 Then, my brethren, ye shall
“reap the rewards of your faith,
and your diligence, and patience,
and long-suffering, waiting for the
tree to bring forth ‘fruit unto you.

CHAPTER 33

Zenos taught that men should pray and
worship in all places, and that judgments
are turned away because of the Son—
Zenock taught that mercy is bestowed
because of the Son—Moses had lifted
up in the wilderness a type of the Son
of God. About 74 B.C.

Now after Alma had spoken these
words, they sent forth unto him de-
siring to know whether they should
believe in ¢one God, that they might

 

ALMA 32:40-33:9

obtain this fruit of which he had
spoken, or "how they should plant
the ‘seed, or the word of which he
had spoken, which he said must be
planted in their hearts; or in what
manner they should begin to exer-
cise their faith.

2 And Alma said unto them: Be-
hold, ye have said that ye “could
not worship your God because ye
are cast out of your synagogues. But
behold, I say unto you, if ye suppose
that ye cannot worship God, ye do
greatly err, and ye ought to search
the ‘scriptures; if ye suppose that
they have taught you this, ye do not
understand them.

3 Do ye remember to have read
what “Zenos, the prophet of old, has
said concerning prayer or °worship?

4 For he said: Thou art merciful, O
God, for thou hast heard my prayer,
even when I was “in the wilderness;
yea, thou wast merciful when I
prayed concerning those who were
mine "enemies, and thou didst turn
them to me.

5 Yea, O God, and thou wast mer-
ciful unto me when I did cry unto
thee in my “field; when I did cry
unto thee in my prayer, and thou
didst hear me.

6 And again, O God, when I did
turn to my house thou didst hear
me in my prayer.

7 And when I did turn unto my
“closet, O Lord, and prayed unto
thee, thou didst hear me.

8 Yea, thou art merciful unto thy
children when they cry unto thee,
to be heard of thee and not of men,
and thou “wilt hear them.

9 Yea, O God, thou hast been mer-
ciful unto me, and heard my cries
in the midst of thy congregations.

10 Yea, and thou hast also heard
me when I have been “cast out and
have been despised by mine en-
emies; yea, thou didst hear my cries,
and wast angry with mine enemies,
and thou didst °visit them in thine
anger with speedy destruction.

11 And thou didst hear me be-
cause of mine afflictions and my
“sincerity; and it is because of thy
Son that thou hast been thus mer-
ciful unto me, therefore I will cry
unto thee in all mine ’afflictions,
for in thee is my joy; for thou hast
turned thy judgments away from
me, “because of thy Son.

12 And now Alma said unto them:
Do ye “believe those scriptures which
have been written by them of old?

13 Behold, if ye do, ye must be-
lieve what “Zenos said; for, behold
he said: Thou hast turned away thy
judgments because of thy Son.

14 Now behold, my brethren, I
would ask if ye have read the scrip-
tures? If ye have, how can ye “dis-
believe on the Son of God?

15 For it is *not written that Ze-
nos alone spake of these things, but
’Zenock also spake of these things—

16 For behold, he said: Thou art
angry, O Lord, with this people, be-
cause they “will not understand thy
mercies which thou hast bestowed
upon them because of thy Son.

17 And now, my brethren, ye see
that a second prophet of old has
testified of the Son of God, and be-
cause the people would not under-
stand his words they “stoned him
to death.

18 But behold, this is not all; these

 

292

are not the only ones who have
spoken concerning the Son of God.

19 Behold, he was spoken of by
“Moses; yea, and behold a "type was
‘raised up in the wilderness, that
whosoever would look upon it might
live. And many did look and live.

20 But few understood the mean-
ing of those things, and this because
of the hardness of their hearts.
But there were many who were so
hardened that they would not look,
therefore they perished. Now the
reason they would not look is be-
cause they did not believe that it
would “heal them.

21 0 my brethren, if ye could be
healed by merely casting about
your eyes that ye might be healed,
would ye not behold quickly, or
would ye rather harden your hearts
in “unbelief, and be ’slothful, that
ye would not cast about your eyes,
that ye might perish?

22 If so, wo shall come upon you;
but if not so, then cast about your
eyes and “begin to believe in the
Son of God, that he will come to re-
deem his people, and that he shall
suffer and die to ’atone for their
sins; and that he shall ‘rise again
from the dead, which shall bring
to pass the “resurrection, that all
men shall stand before him, to be
‘judged at the last and judgment
day, according to their ‘works.

23 And now, my brethren, I desire
that ye shall ¢plant this word in your
hearts, and as it beginneth to swell
even so nourish it by your faith. And
behold, it will become a tree, ’spring-
ing up in you unto ‘everlasting

you that your “burdens may be

even all this can ye do if ye ‘will.
Amen.

CHAPTER 34

Amulek testifies that the word is in
Christ unto salvation—Unless an
atonement is made, all mankind must
perish—The whole law of Moses points
toward the sacrifice of the Son of God—
The eternal plan of redemption is based
on faith and repentance—Pray for tem-
poral and spiritual blessings—This life
is the time for men to prepare to meet
God—Work out your salvation with
fear before God. About 74 B.c.

AND now it came to pass that after
Alma had spoken these words unto
them he sat down upon the ground,
and “Amulek arose and began to
teach them, saying:

2 My brethren, I think that it is
impossible that ye should be igno-
rant of the things which have been
spoken concerning the coming of
Christ, who is taught by us to be
the Son of God; yea, I know that
“these things were taught unto you
bountifully before your dissension
from among us.

3 And as ye have desired of my be-
loved brother that he should make
known unto you “what ye should
do, because of your afflictions; and
he hath spoken somewhat unto you
to prepare your minds; yea, and he
hath exhorted you unto faith and
to patience—

4 Yea, even that ye would have so
much faith as even to “plant the

 

ALMA 34:1-10

word in your hearts, that ye may
try the experiment of its goodness.

5 And we have beheld that the
great question which is in your
minds is whether the word be in the
Son of God, or whether there shall
be “no Christ.

6 And ye also beheld that my
brother has proved unto you, in
many instances, that the “word is
in Christ unto salvation.

7 My brother has called upon the
words of #Zenos, that redemption
cometh through the Son of God, and
also upon the words of *Zenock; and
also he has appealed unto ‘Moses,
to prove that these things are true.

8 And now, behold, I will “testify
unto you of myself that these things
are true. Behold, I say unto you, that
I do know that Christ shall come
among the children of men, to take
upon him the ’transgressions of his
people, and that he shall ‘atone for
the sins of the world; for the Lord
God hath spoken it.

9 For it is expedient that an “atone-
ment should be made; for according
to the great plan of the Eternal God
there must be an atonement made,
or else all mankind must unavoid-
ably perish; yea, all are hardened;
yea, all are ‘fallen and are lost, and
must perish except it be through
the atonement which it is expedient
should be made.

10 For it is expedient that there
should be a great and last “sacrifice;
yea, not a ’sacrifice of man, neither
of beast, neither of any manner of
fowl; for it shall not be a human
sacrifice; but it must be an ‘infinite
and “eternal ‘sacrifice.

ALMA 34:11-27

11 Now there is not any man that
can sacrifice his own blood which
will atone for the sins of another.
Now, if a man murdereth, behold
will our law, which is “just, take
the life of his brother? I say unto
you, Nay.

12 But the law requireth the “life
of him who hath murdered; there-
fore there can be nothing which is
short of an infinite atonement which
will suffice for the sins of the world.

13 Therefore, it is expedient that
there should be a great and last
sacrifice, and then shall there be,
or it is expedient there should be,
a *stop to the shedding of blood;
then shall the ‘law of Moses be ful-
filled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled,
every jot and tittle, and none shall
have passed away.

14 And behold, this is the whole
“meaning of the "law, every whit
“pointing to that great and last “sacri-
fice; and that great and last ‘sacrifice
will be the Son of God, yea, ‘infinite
and eternal.

15 And thus he shall bring ¢sal-
vation to all those who shall be-
lieve on his name; this being the
intent of this last sacrifice, to bring
about the bowels of mercy, which
overpowereth justice, and bringeth
about means unto men that they
may have faith unto repentance.

16 And thus “mercy can satisfy
the demands of "justice, and en-
circles them in the arms of safety,
while he that exercises no faith
unto repentance is exposed to the

 

294

whole law of the demands of ‘jus-
tice; therefore only unto him that
has faith unto repentance is brought
about the great and eternal “plan of
“redemption.

17 Therefore may God grant unto
you, my brethren, that ye may begin
to exercise your “faith unto repen-
tance, that ye begin to ’call upon
his holy name, that he would have
mercy upon you;

18 Yea, cry unto him for mercy;
for he is “mighty to save.

19 Yea, humble yourselves, and
continue in “prayer unto him.

20 Cry unto him when ye are in
your “fields, yea, over all your flocks.

21 “Cry unto him in your houses,
yea, over all your household, both
morning, mid-day, and evening.

22 Yea, cry unto him against the
power of your “enemies.

23 Yea, ¢cry unto him against the
’devil, who is an enemy to all ‘righ-
teousness.

24 Cry unto him over the crops
of your fields, that ye may prosper
in them.

25 Cry over the flocks of your
fields, that they may increase.

26 But this is not all; ye must
“pour out your souls in your °’clos-
ets, and your secret places, and in
your wilderness.

27 Yea, and when you do not cry
unto the Lord, let your “hearts be
full, drawn out in prayer unto him
continually for your ‘welfare, and
also for the welfare of “those who
are around you.

28 And now behold, my beloved
brethren, I say unto you, do not sup-
pose that this is all; for after ye have
done all these things, if ye “turn
away the ’needy, and the ‘naked,
and visit not the sick and afflicted,
and “impart of your substance, if ye
have, to those who stand in need—I
say unto you, if ye do not any of
these things, behold, your “prayer
is ‘vain, and availeth you nothing,
and ye are as “hypocrites who do
deny the faith.

29 Therefore, if ye do not remem-
ber to be ¢charitable, ye are as dross,
which the refiners do cast out, (it
being of no worth) and is trodden
under foot of men.

30 And now, my brethren, I would
that, after ye have “received so
many witnesses, seeing that the holy
scriptures testify of these things, ye
come forth and bring °fruit unto
repentance.

31 Yea, I would that ye would come
forth and “harden not your hearts
any longer; for behold, now is the
time and the °day of your ‘salvation;
and therefore, if ye will repent and
“harden not your hearts, immedi-
ately shall the great plan of redemp-
tion be brought about unto you.

32 For behold, this “life is the time
for men to "prepare to meet God;
yea, behold the day of ‘this life is
the day for men to perform their
4{abors.

33 And now, as I said unto you
before, as ye have had so many

 

ALMA 34:28-37

“witnesses, therefore, I beseech of
you that ye do not "procrastinate the
day of your ‘repentance until the
end; for after this day of life, which
is given us to prepare for eternity,
behold, if we do not improve our
time while in this life, then cometh
the ‘night of ‘darkness wherein
there can be no labor performed.

34 Ye cannot say, when ye are
brought to that awful “crisis, that
I will repent, that I will return to
my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for
that same spirit which doth "possess
your bodies at the time that ye go
out of this life, that same spirit will
have power to possess your body in
that eternal world.

35 For behold, if ye have procras-
tinated the day of your repentance
even until death, behold, ye have
become “subjected to the spirit of
the devil, and he doth ’seal you his;
therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath
withdrawn from you, and hath no
place in you, and the devil hath
all power over you; and this is the
final state of the wicked.

36 And this I Know, because the
Lord hath said he dwelleth not in
“unholy temples, but in the "hearts
of the ‘righteous doth he dwell; yea,
and he has also said that the righ-
teous shall sit down in his king-
dom, to go no more out; but their
garments should be made white
through the “blood of the Lamb.

these things, and that ye should
*work out your salvation with fear
before God, and that ye should no
more deny the coming of Christ;

38 That ye “contend no more
against the Holy Ghost, but that ye
receive it, and take upon you the
’name of Christ; that ye humble your-
selves even to the dust, and ‘worship
God, in whatsoever place ye may be
in, in spirit and in truth; and that
ye live in “thanksgiving daily, for
the many “mercies and blessings
which he doth bestow upon you.

39 Yea, and Lalso “exhort you, my
brethren, that ye be ’watchful unto
prayer continually, that ye may not
be led away by the ‘temptations
of the devil, that he may not over-
power you, that ye may not become
his subjects at the last day; for be-
hold, he rewardeth you “no good
thing.

40 And now my beloved brethren, I
would exhort you to have “patience,
and that ye bear with all manner
of ’afflictions; that ye do not ‘revile
against those who do cast you out
because of your “exceeding pov-
erty, lest ye become sinners like
unto them;

41 But that ye have “patience, and
bear with those afflictions, witha
firm hope that ye shall one day rest
from all your afflictions.

CHAPTER 35

The preaching of the word destroys
the craft of the Zoramites—They expel
the converts, who then join the people
of Ammon in Jershon—Alma sorrows
because of the wickedness of the people.
About 74 B.c.

Now it came to pass that after
Amulek had made an end of these

 

296

words, they withdrew themselves
from the multitude and came over
into the land of “Jershon.

2 Yea, and the rest of the brethren,
after they had preached the word
unto the ¢“Zoramites, also came over
into the land of Jershon.

3 And it came to pass that after
the more popular part of the Zor-
amites had consulted together con-
cerning the words which had been
preached unto them, they were an-
gry because of the word, for it did
destroy their “craft; therefore they
would not hearken unto the words.

4 And they sent and gathered
together throughout all the land
all the people, and consulted with
them concerning the words which
had been spoken.

5 Now their rulers and their priests
and their teachers did not let the
people know concerning their
desires; therefore they found out
privily the minds of all the people.

6 And it came to pass that after
they had found out the minds of
all the people, those who were in
favor of the words which had been
spoken by Alma and his brethren
were cast out of the land; and they
were “many; and they came over
also into the land of Jershon.

7 And it came to pass that Alma
and his brethren did minister unto
them.

8 Now the people of the Zoram-
ites were angry with the “people of
Ammon who were in Jershon, and
the "chief ruler of the Zoramites,
being a very wicked man, sent over
unto the people of Ammon desiring
them that they should cast out of
their land all those who came over
from them into their land.

9 And he breathed out many

threatenings against them. And
now the people of Ammon did not
fear their words; therefore they did
not cast them out, but they did re-
ceive all the poor of the Zoramites
that came over unto them; and they
did “nourish them, and did clothe
them, and did give unto them lands
for their inheritance; and they did
administer unto them according to
their wants.

10 Now this did “stir up the Zoram-
ites to "anger against the people of
Ammon, and they began to mix with
the Lamanites and to stir them up
also to anger against them.

11 And thus the Zoramites and the
Lamanites began to make prepara-
tions for war against the people of Am-
mon, and also against the Nephites.

12 And thus ended the seventeenth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi.

13 And the people of Ammon de-
parted out of the land of Jershon,
and came over into the land of Me-
lek, and gave place in the land of
Jershon for the armies of the Neph-
ites, that they might contend with
the armies of the Lamanites and the
armies of the Zoramites; and thus
commenced a war betwixt the La-
manites and the Nephites, in the
eighteenth year of the reign of
the judges; and an “account shall
be given of their wars hereafter.

14 And Alma, and Ammon, and
their brethren, and also the “two
sons of Alma returned to the land
of Zarahemla, after having been
instruments in the hands of God
of bringing "many of the ‘Zoram-
ites to repentance; and as many as
were brought to repentance were
driven out of their land; but they
have lands for their inheritance in
the land of Jershon, and they have
taken up arms to defend themselves,

 

ALMA 35:10-36:2

and their wives, and children, and
their lands.

15 Now Alma, being “grieved for
the iniquity of his people, yea for the
wars, and the bloodsheds, and the
contentions which were among
them; and having been to declare
the word, or sent to declare the word,
among all the people in every city;
and seeing that the hearts of the
people began to wax hard, and that
they began to be *offended because
of the strictness of the word, his
heart was exceedingly sorrowful.

16 Therefore, he caused that his
sons should be gathered together,
that he might give unto them every
one his “charge, separately, con-
cerning the things pertaining unto
righteousness. And we have an ac-
count of his commandments, which
he gave unto them according to
his own record.

The commandments of Alma to his
son Helaman.

Comprising chapters 36 and 37.

CHAPTER 36

Alma testifies to Helaman of his conver-
sion after seeing an angel—He suffered
the pains of a damned soul; he called upon
the name of Jesus, and was then born of
God—Sweet joy filled his soul—He saw
concourses of angels praising God—Many
converts have tasted and seen as he has
tasted and seen. About 74 B.c.

My “son, give ear to my words; for
I swear unto you, that inasmuch as
ye shall keep the commandments
of God ye shall prosper in the land.

21 would that ye should do as
I have done, in remembering the
captivity of our fathers; for they
were in “bondage, and none could

’deliver them except it was the
‘God of Abraham, and the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and
he surely did deliver them in their
afflictions.

3 And now, O my son Helaman,
behold, thou art in thy youth, and
therefore, I beseech of thee that
thou wilt hear my words and learn
of me; for I do know that whosoever
shall put their “trust in God shall be
supported in their "trials, and their
troubles, and their afflictions, and
shall be ‘lifted up at the last day.

4 And I would not that ye think
that I¢know of myself—not of the
temporal but of the spiritual, not of
the ’carnal mind but of God.

5 Now, behold, I say unto you, if I
had not been “born of God I should
’not have known these things; but
God has, by the mouth of his holy
‘angel, made these things known
unto me, not of any “worthiness
of myself;

6 For I went about with the sons
of Mosiah, seeking to “destroy the
church of God; but behold, God sent
his holy angel to stop us by the way.

7 And behold, he spake unto us,
as it were the voice of thunder,
and the whole earth did “tremble
beneath our feet; and we all fell to
the earth, for the "fear of the Lord
came upon us.

8 But behold, the voice said unto
me: Arise. And I arose and stood
up, and beheld the angel.

9 And he said unto me: If thou
wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no
more to destroy the church of God.

10 And it came to pass that I fell to

 

298

the earth; and it was for the space
of “three days and three nights
that I could not open my mouth,
neither had I the use of my limbs.

11 And the angel spake more
things unto me, which were heard
by my brethren, but I did *not hear
them; for when I heard the words—
If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself,
seek no more to destroy the church
of God—I was struck with such great
fear and amazement lest perhaps I
should be destroyed, that I fell to
the earth and I did hear no more.

12 But I was racked with “eternal
’torment, for my soul was ‘harrowed
up to the greatest degree and racked
with all my sins.

13 Yea, I did remember all my sins
and iniquities, for which I was “tor-
mented with the "pains of hell; yea,
I saw that I had ‘rebelled against
my God, and that I had not kept his
holy commandments.

14 Yea, and [had “murdered many
of his children, or rather led them
away unto destruction; yea, and in
fine so great had been my iniqui-
ties, that the very thought of com-
ing into the presence of my God
did rack my soul with inexpressible
horror.

15 Oh, thought I, that I ¢could be
banished and become extinct both
soul and body, that I might not be
brought to stand in the presence of
my God, to be judged of my °deeds.

16 And now, for three days and
for three nights was I racked, even
with the “pains of a "damned soul.

17 And it came to pass that as I was
thus “racked with torment, while I

was "harrowed up by the ‘memory
of my many sins, behold, I ¢remem-
bered also to have heard my father
prophesy unto the people concern-
ing the coming of one Jesus Christ,
a Son of God, to atone for the sins
of the world.

18 Now, as my mind caught hold
upon this thought, I cried within
my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God,
“have mercy on me, who am °in the
‘gall of bitterness, and am encircled
about by the everlasting @chains of
‘death.

19 And now, behold, when I thought
this, I could remember my “pains
’no more; yea, I was harrowed up
by the memory of my sins no more.

20 And oh, what ¢joy, and what
marvelous light I did behold; yea,
my soul was filled with joy as ex-
ceeding as was my pain!

21 Yea, lsay unto you, my son, that
there could be nothing so exquisite
and so bitter as were my pains. Yea,
and again I say unto you, my son,
that on the other hand, there can
be nothing so exquisite and sweet
as was my joy.

22 Yea, methought I saw, even as
our father “Lehi saw, God sitting
upon his throne, surrounded with
numberless concourses of angels, in
the attitude of singing and ’prais-
ing their God; yea, and my soul did
long to be there.

23 But behold, my limbs did receive
their “strength again, and I stood
upon my feet, and did manifest

 

ALMA 36:18-28

unto the people that I had been
’born of God.

24 Yea, and from that time even
until now, I have labored without
ceasing, that I might bring souls
unto “repentance; that I might bring
them to ’taste of the exceeding joy
of which I did taste; that they might
also be ‘born of God, and be “filled
with the Holy Ghost.

25 Yea, and now behold, O my
son, the Lord doth “give me exceed-
ingly great joy in the fruit of my
>labors;

26 For because of the “word which
he has imparted unto me, behold,
many have been born of God, and
have "tasted as I have tasted, and have
seen eye to eye as I have seen; there-
fore they do know of these things of
which I have spoken, as I do know;
and the knowledge which I have
is of God.

27 And Ihave been supported un-
der trials and troubles of every kind,
yea, and in all manner of afflictions;
yea, God has @delivered me from
prison, and from bonds, and from
death; yea, and I do put my trust in
him, and he will still "deliver me.

28 And I know that he will 4raise
me up at the last day, to dwell with
him in °glory; yea, and I will ‘praise
him forever, for he has “brought
our fathers out of Egypt, and he
has swallowed up the ‘Egyptians in
the Red Sea; and he led them by his
power into the promised land; yea,
and he has delivered them out of

29 Yea, and he has also brought
our fathers out of the land of Jeru-
salem; and he has also, by his ever-
lasting power, delivered them out of
*bondage and captivity, from time
to time even down to the present
day; and I have always retained in
remembrance their captivity; yea,
and ye also ought to retain in re-
membrance, as I have done, their
captivity.

30 But behold, my son, this is not
all; for ye ought to know as I do
know, that “inasmuch as ye shall
keep the commandments of God ye
shall *prosper in the land; and ye
ought to know also, that inasmuch
as ye will not keep the command-
ments of God ye shall be cut off from
his presence. Now this is according
to his word.

CHAPTER 37

The plates of brass and other scriptures
are preserved to bring souls to salva-
tion—The Jaredites were destroyed
because of their wickedness—Their
secret oaths and covenants must be
kept from the people—Counsel with
the Lord in all your doings—As the
Liahona guided the Nephites, so the
word of Christ leads men to eternal life.
About 74 B.c.

AND now, my son Helaman, I com-
mand you that ye take the “records
which have been ’entrusted with me;

2 And Lalso command you that ye
keep a “record of this people, accord-
ing as I have done, upon the plates
of Nephi, and keep all these things

 

300

sacred which I have kept, even as I
have kept them; for it is for a wise
purpose that they are kept.

3 And these “plates of brass, which
contain these engravings, which
have the records of the holy scrip-
tures upon them, which have the
’senealogy of our forefathers, even
from the beginning—

4 Behold, it has been prophesied
by our fathers, that they should be
kept and “handed down from one
generation to another, and be kept
and preserved by the hand of the
Lord until they should go forth unto
every nation, kindred, tongue, and
people, that they shall know of the
’mysteries contained thereon.

5 And now behold, if they are
kept they must retain their bright-
ness; yea, and they will retain their
brightness; yea, and also shall all
the plates which do contain that
which is holy writ.

6 Now ye may suppose that this is
“foolishness in me; but behold I say
unto you, that by small and sim-
ple things are great things brought
to pass; and small means in many
instances doth confound the wise.

7 And the Lord God doth work
by “means to bring about his great
and eternal purposes; and by very
’small means the Lord doth ‘con-
found the wise and bringeth about
the salvation of many souls.

8 And now, it has hitherto been
wisdom in God that these things
should be preserved; for behold,
“they have "enlarged the memory
of this people, yea, and convinced
many of the error of their ways, and
brought them to the ‘knowledge of

their God unto the salvation of

9 Yea, I say unto you, “were it not
for these things that these records do
contain, which are on these plates,
Ammon and his brethren could not
have ’convinced so many thousands
of the Lamanites of the incorrect
tradition of their fathers; yea, these
records and their ‘words brought
them unto repentance; that is, they
brought them to the knowledge of
the Lord their God, and to rejoice
in Jesus Christ their Redeemer.

10 And who knoweth but what
they will be the “means of bringing
many thousands of them, yea, and
also many thousands of our °stiff-
necked brethren, the Nephites, who
are now hardening their hearts in
sin and iniquities, to the knowledge
of their Redeemer?

11 Now these mysteries are not yet
fully made known unto me; there-
fore I shall forbear.

12 And it may suffice if I only
say they are preserved for a “wise
purpose, which purpose is known
unto God; for he doth ’counsel in
wisdom over all his works, and his
paths are straight, and his course
is ‘one eternal round.

13 Oremember, remember, my son
Helaman, how “strict are the com-
mandments of God. And he said: *If
ye will keep my commandments ye
shall ‘prosper in the land—but if
ye keep not his commandments ye
shall be cut off from his presence.

14 And now remember, my son,
that God has “entrusted you with
these things, which are "sacred,
which he has kept sacred, and also
which he will keep and ‘preserve
for a “wise purpose in him, that he

 

ALMA 37:9-21

may show forth his power unto fu-
ture generations.

15 And now behold, I tell you by
the spirit of prophecy, that if ye
transgress the commandments of
God, behold, these things which
are sacred shall be taken away from
you by the power of God, and ye
shall be delivered up unto Satan,
that he may sift you as chaff before
the wind.

16 But if ye keep the command-
ments of God, and do with these
things which are sacred according
to that which the Lord doth com-
mand you, (for you must appeal
unto the Lord for all things whatso-
ever ye must do with them) behold,
no power of earth or hell can “take
them from you, for God is powerful
to the fulfilling of all his words.

17 For he will fulfil all his *prom-
ises which he shall make unto you,
for he has fulfilled his promises
which he has made unto our fathers.

18 For he promised unto them that
he would “preserve these things
for a wise purpose in him, that he
might show forth his power unto
future generations.

19 And now behold, one purpose
hath he fulfilled, even to the res-
toration of “many thousands of the
Lamanites to the knowledge of
the truth; and he hath shown forth
his power in them, and he will also
still show forth his power in them
unto ’future generations; therefore
they shall be preserved.

20 Therefore I command you, my
son Helaman, that ye be diligent in
fulfilling all my words, and that ye
be diligent in keeping the command-
ments of God as they are written.

21 And now, I will speak unto

you concerning those “twenty-four
plates, that ye keep them, that the
’mysteries and the works of dark-
ness, and their secret works, or the
secret works of those people who
have been destroyed, may be made

yea, and that ye preserve these “in-

22 For behold, the Lord saw that
his people began to work in dark-
ness, yea, work secret murders and
abominations; therefore the Lord
said, if they did not repent they
should be destroyed from off the
face of the earth.

23 And the Lord said: I will prepare
unto my servant Gazelem, a “stone,
which shall shine forth in darkness
unto light, that I may 'discover unto
my people who serve me, that I
may discover unto them the works
of their brethren, yea, their secret
works, their works of darkness, and
their wickedness and abominations.

24 And now, my son, these “inter-
preters were prepared that the word
of God might be fulfilled, which he
spake, saying:

25 I will “bring forth out of dark-
ness unto light all their secret works
and their abominations; and except
they repent I will "destroy them from
off the face of the earth; and I will
bring to light all their secrets and
abominations, unto every nation
that shall hereafter possess the land.

26 And now, my son, we see that
they did not repent; therefore they
have been destroyed, and thus far
the word of God has been fulfilled;

 

302

yea, their “secret abominations have
been brought out of darkness and
made known unto us.

27 And now, my son, I command
you that ye retain all their oaths,
and their covenants, and their agree-
ments in their secret abominations;
yea, and all their signs and their
wonders ye shall "keep from this
people, that they know them not,
lest peradventure they should fall
into darkness also and be destroyed.

28 For behold, there is a “curse
upon all this land, that destruction
shall come upon all those workers
of darkness, according to the power
of God, when they are fully ripe;
therefore I desire that this people
might not be destroyed.

29 Therefore ye shall keep these
secret plans of their “oaths and
their covenants from this people,
and only their wickedness and
their murders and their abomina-
tions shall ye make known unto
them; and ye shall teach them to
babhor such wickedness and abomi-
nations and murders; and ye shall
also teach them that these people
were destroyed on account of their
wickedness and abominations and
their murders.

30 For behold, they “murdered all
the prophets of the Lord who came
among them to declare unto them
concerning their iniquities; and
the blood of those whom they mur-
dered did cry unto the Lord their
God for vengeance upon those who
were their murderers; and thus the
judgments of God did come upon
these workers of darkness and se-
cret "combinations.

31 Yea, and “cursed be the land for-
ever and ever unto those workers of

darkness and secret combinations,

repent before they are fully "ripe.

32 And now, my son, remember
the words which I have spoken unto
you; trust not those secret plans
unto this people, but teach them
an everlasting “hatred against sin
and iniquity.

33 *Preach unto them repentance,
and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ;
teach them to humble themselves
and to be *meek and lowly in heart;
teach them to ‘withstand every
“temptation of the devil, with their
faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.

34 Teach them to never be weary
of good works, but to be meek and
lowly in heart; for such shall find
“rest to their souls.

35 O, remember, my son, and “learn
’wisdom in thy ‘youth; yea, learn
in thy youth to keep the command-
ments of God.

36 Yea, and “cry unto God for all
thy support; yea, let all thy °do-
ings be unto the Lord, and whith-
ersoever thou goest let it be in the
Lord; yea, let all thy ‘thoughts be
directed unto the Lord; yea, let the
affections of thy heart be placed
upon the Lord forever.

37 *Counsel with the Lord in all
thy doings, and he will direct thee
for "good; yea, when thou liest down
at night lie down unto the Lord,
that he may watch over you in your
sleep; and when thou risest in the
‘morning let thy heart be full of
thanks unto God; and if ye do these
things, ye shall be lifted up at the
last day.

 

ALMA 37:32-43

38 And now, my son, I have
somewhat to say concerning the
thing which our fathers call a ball,
or director—or our fathers called
it “Liahona, which is, being inter-
preted, a compass; and the Lord
prepared it.

39 And behold, there cannot any
man work after the manner of so
curious a workmanship. And be-
hold, it was prepared to show unto
our fathers the course which they
should travel in the wilderness.

40 And it did work for them
according to their “faith in God;
therefore, if they had faith to be-
lieve that God could cause that
those spindles should point the
way they should go, behold, it was
done; therefore they had this mira-
cle, and also many other miracles
wrought by the power of God, day
by day.

41 Nevertheless, because those
miracles were worked by “small
means it did show unto them mar-
velous works. They were ’slothful,
and forgot to exercise their faith
and diligence and then those mar-
velous works ceased, and they did
not progress in their journey;

42 Therefore, they tarried in the
wilderness, or did “not travel a di-
rect course, and were afflicted with
hunger and thirst, because of their
transgressions.

43 And now, my son, I would that
ye should understand that these
things are not without a *shadow;
for as our fathers were slothful to
give heed to this compass (now
these things were temporal) they

did not prosper; even so it is with
things which are spiritual.

44 For behold, it is as easy to give
heed to the “word of Christ, which
will point to you a straight course to
eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers
to give heed to this compass, which
would point unto them a straight
course to the promised land.

45 And now I say, is there not
a “type in this thing? For just as
surely as this director did bring our
fathers, by following its course, to
the promised land, shall the words
of Christ, if we follow their course,
carry us beyond this vale of sorrow
into a far better land of promise.

46 O my son, do not let us be
“slothful because of the "easiness
of the ‘way; for so was it with our
fathers; for so was it prepared for
them, that if they would “look they
might ‘live; even so it is with us.
The way is prepared, and if we will
look we may live forever.

47 And now, my son, see that ye
take “care of these sacred things,
yea, see that ye "look to God and
live. Go unto this people and de-
clare the word, and be sober. My
son, farewell.

The commandments of Alma to his
son Shiblon.

Comprising chapter 38.

CHAPTER 38

Shiblon was persecuted for righteous-
ness’ sake—Salvation is in Christ, who

 

304

is the life and the light of the world—
Bridle all your passions. About 74 B.c.

My “son, give ear to my words, for
I say unto you, even as I said unto
Helaman, that inasmuch as ye shall
keep the commandments of God
ye shall prosper in the land; and
inasmuch as ye will not Keep the
commandments of God ye shall be
‘cut off from his “presence.

2 And now, my son, I trust that I
shall have great joy in you, because
of your “steadiness and your faith-
fulness unto God; for as you have
commenced in your youth to look
to the Lord your God, even so I hope
that you will continue in keeping
his commandments; for blessed is
he that °endureth to the end.

31 say unto you, my son, that I
have had great joy in thee already,
because of thy faithfulness and thy
diligence, and thy patience and
thy long-suffering among the peo-
ple of the *Zoramites.

4 For I know that thou wast in
bonds; yea, and I also know that
thou wast stoned for the word’s sake;
and thou didst bear all these things
with “patience because the Lord was
>with thee; and now thou knowest
that the Lord did deliver thee.

5 And now my son, Shiblon, I
would that ye should remember, that
as much as ye shall put your “trust
in God even so much ye shall be *de-
livered out of your trials, and your
‘troubles, and your afflictions, and
ye shall be lifted up at the last day.

should think that I know these

things of myself, but it is the Spirit
of God which is in me which mak-
eth these things known unto me;
for if had not been “born of God I
should not have known these things.

7 But behold, the Lord in his great
mercy sent his “angel to declare
unto me that I must stop the work
of "destruction among his people;
yea, and I have seen an angel face
to face, and he spake with me, and
his voice was as thunder, and it
shook the whole earth.

8 And it came to pass that I was
*three days and three nights in
the most bitter "pain and ‘anguish
of soul; and never, until 1 did cry
out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for
mercy, did I receive a“remission of
my sins. But behold, I did cry unto
him and I did find peace to my soul.

9 And now, my son, I have told
you this that ye may learn wis-
dom, that ye may learn of me that
there is *no other way or means
whereby man can be saved, only in
and through Christ. Behold, he is
the life and the “light of the world.
Behold, he is the word of truth and
‘righteousness.

10 And now, as ye have begun to
teach the word even so I would that
ye should continue to teach; and I
would that ye would be diligent
and “temperate in all things.

11 See that ye are not lifted up
unto pride; yea, see that ye do not
“boast in your own wisdom, nor of
your much strength.

12 Use “boldness, but not overbear-
ance; and also see that ye "bridle
all your passions, that ye may be
filled with love; see that ye refrain
from idleness.

 

ALMA 38:7-39:2

13 Do not “pray as the Zoramites
do, for ye have seen that they pray to
be heard of men, and to be praised
for their wisdom.

14 Do not say: O God, I thank thee
that we are “better than our breth-
ren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive
my ’unworthiness, and remember
my brethren in mercy—yea, ac-
knowledge your unworthiness be-
fore God at all times.

15 And may the Lord bless your
soul, and receive you at the last day
into his kingdom, to sit down in
peace. Now go, my son, and teach
the word unto this people. Be 4so-
ber. My son, farewell.

AND now, my “son, I have somewhat
more to say unto thee than what I
said unto thy brother; for behold,
have ye not observed the steadiness
of thy brother, his faithfulness, and
his diligence in keeping the com-
mandments of God? Behold, has he
not set a good "example for thee?
2 For thou didst not give so much
heed unto my words as did thy
brother, among the people of the

boasting in thy strength and thy

3 And this is not all, my son. Thou
didst do that which was grievous
unto me; for thou didst forsake the
ministry, and did go over into the
land of Siron among the borders
of the Lamanites, after the “harlot
Isabel.

4 Yea, she did “steal away the
hearts of many; but this was no ex-
cuse for thee, my son. Thou shouldst
have tended to the ministry where-
with thou wast entrusted.

5 Know ye not, my son, that these
things are an abomination in the
sight of the Lord; yea, most ¢abomi-
nable above all sins save it be the
shedding of innocent "blood or de-
nying the Holy Ghost?

6 For behold, if ye *deny the Holy
Ghost when it once has had place
in you, and ye know that ye deny
it, behold, this is a sin which is
unpardonable; yea, and whosoever
murdereth against the light and
knowledge of God, it is not easy for
him to obtain ‘forgiveness; yea, I
say unto you, my son, that it is not
easy for him to obtain a forgiveness.

7 And now, my son, I would to God
that ye had not been “guilty of so
great a crime. I would not dwell
upon your crimes, to harrow up
your soul, if it were not for your
good.

8 But behold, ye cannot “hide your
crimes from God; and except ye re-
pent they will stand as a testimony
against you at the last day.

9 Now my son, I would that ye

 

306

should repent and forsake your sins,
and go no more after the “lusts of
your eyes, but ’cross yourself in all
these things; for except ye do this ye
can in nowise inherit the kingdom
of God. Oh, remember, and take it
upon you, and ‘cross yourself in
these things.

10 And I command you to take it
upon you to counsel with your elder
brothers in your undertakings; for
behold, thou art in thy youth, and
ye stand in need to be nourished
by your brothers. And give heed to
their counsel.

11 Suffer not yourself to be led
away by any vain or foolish thing;
suffer not the devil to lead away
your heart again after those wicked
harlots. Behold, O my son, how
great “iniquity ye brought upon the
’Zoramites; for when they saw your
“conduct they would not believe in
my words.

12 And now the Spirit of the Lord
doth say unto me: “Command thy
children to do good, lest they "lead
away the hearts of many people to
destruction; therefore I command
you, my son, in the fear of God, that
ye ‘refrain from your iniquities;

13 That ye turn to the Lord with
all your mind, might, and strength;
that ye lead away the hearts of no
more to do wickedly; but rather re-
turn unto them, and “acknowledge
your faults and that wrong which
ye have done.

14 *Seek not after riches nor the
vain things of this world; for behold,
you cannot carry them with you.

15 And now, my son, I would say
somewhat unto you concerning the
“coming of Christ. Behold, I say unto
you, that it is he that surely shall
come to take away the sins of the
world; yea, he cometh to declare glad
tidings of salvation unto his people.

16 And now, my son, this was the
ministry unto which ye were called,
to declare these glad tidings unto
this people, to prepare their minds;
or rather that salvation might come
unto them, that they may prepare
the minds of their “children to
hear the word at the time of his
coming.

17 And now I will ease your mind
somewhat on this subject. Behold,
you marvel why these things should
be known so long beforehand. Be-
hold, I say unto you, is not a soul
at this time as precious unto God
as a soul will be at the time of his
coming?

18 Is it not as necessary that the
plan of redemption should be “made
known unto this people as well as
unto their children?

19 Is it not as easy at this time for
the Lord to “send his angel to de-
clare these glad tidings unto us as
unto our children, or as after the
time of his coming?

CHAPTER 40

Christ brings to pass the resurrection
of all men—The righteous dead go to
paradise and the wicked to outer dark-
ness to await the day of their resur-
rection—All things will be restored to
their proper and perfect frame in the
Resurrection. About 74 B.c.

Now my son, here is somewhat more
I would say unto thee; for I perceive

 

ALMA 39:15-40:8

that thy mind is worried concern-
ing the resurrection of the dead.

2 Behold, I say unto you, that there
is no resurrection—or, I would say,
in other words, that this mortal
does not put on “immortality, this
corruption does not ’put on incor-
ruption—until after the coming of
Christ.

3 Behold, he bringeth to pass the
“resurrection of the dead, But be-
hold, my son, the resurrection is not
yet. Now, | unfold unto you a mys-
tery; nevertheless, there are many
b’mysteries which are ‘kept, that no
one knoweth them save God him-
self. But lshow unto you one thing
which I have inquired diligently
of God that I might know—that is
concerning the resurrection.

4 Behold, there is a time appointed
that all shall “come forth from the
dead. Now when this time cometh
no one knows; but God knoweth the
time which is appointed.

5 Now, whether there shall be one
time, or a “second time, or a third
time, that men shall come forth
from the dead, it mattereth not;
for God ’knoweth all these things;
and it sufficeth me to know that
this is the case—that there is a time
appointed that all shall rise from
the dead.

6 Now there must needs be a space
betwixt the time of death and the
time of the resurrection.

7 And now I would inquire what
becometh of the “souls of men *from
this time of death to the time ap-
pointed for the resurrection?

8 Now whether there is more than
one “time appointed for men to rise
it mattereth not; for all do not die at
once, and this mattereth not; all is

as one day with God, and time only
is measured unto men.

9 Therefore, there is a time ap-
pointed unto men that they shall
rise from the dead; and there is a
space between the time of death
and the resurrection. And now,
concerning this space of time, what
becometh of the souls of men is the
thing which I have inquired dili-
gently of the Lord to know; and
this is the thing of which I do know.

10 And when the time cometh
when all shall rise, then shall they
know that God “knoweth all the
*times which are appointed unto
man.

11 Now, concerning the “state of
the soul between ’death and the
resurrection—Behold, it has been
made known unto me by an angel,
that the spirits of all men, as soon
as they are departed from this mor-
tal body, yea, the spirits of all men,
whether they be good or evil, are
‘taken “home to that God who gave
them life.

12 And then shall it come to pass,
that the spirits of those who are
righteous are received into a state
of “happiness, which is called
’paradise, a state of rest, a state of
“peace, where they shall rest from
all their troubles and from all care,
and sorrow.

13 And then shall it come to pass,
that the “spirits of the wicked, yea,
who are evil—for behold, they have
no part nor portion of the Spirit of
the Lord; for behold, they chose evil
works rather than good; therefore

 

308

the spirit of the "devil did enter into
them, and take possession of their
house—and these shall be cast out
into “outer darkness; there shall be
4weeping, and wailing, and gnashing
of teeth, and this because of their
own iniquity, being led captive by
the will of the devil.

14 Now this is the state of the
“souls of the ’wicked, yea, in dark-
ness, and a state of awful, ‘fearful
looking for the fiery “indignation of
the wrath of God upon them; thus
they remain in this ‘state, as well
as the righteous in paradise, until
the time of their resurrection.

15 Now, there are some that have
understood that this state of happi-
ness and this state of misery of the
soul, before the resurrection, was
a first resurrection. Yea, I admit it
may be termed a resurrection, the
“raising of the spirit or the soul and
their consignation to happiness
or misery, according to the words

16 And behold, again it hath been
spoken, that there is a “first *resur-
rection, a resurrection of all those
who have been, or who are, or who
shall be, down to the resurrection
of Christ from the dead.

17 Now, we do not suppose that
this first resurrection, which is spo-
ken of in this manner, can be the
resurrection of the souls and their
*consignation to happiness or mis-
ery. Ye cannot suppose that this is
what it meaneth.

soul with the body, of those from
the days of Adam down to the res-
urrection of Christ.

19 Now, whether the souls and the
bodies of those of whom has been
spoken shall all be reunited at once,
the wicked as well as the righteous,
Ido not say; let it suffice, that I say
that they all come forth; or in other
words, their resurrection cometh
to pass “before the resurrection of
those who die after the resurrec-
tion of Christ.

20 Now, my son, I do not say that
their resurrection cometh at the res-
urrection of Christ; but behold, I give
it as my opinion, that the souls and
the bodies are reunited, of the righ-
teous, at the resurrection of Christ,
and his “ascension into heaven.

21 But whether it be at his resur-
rection or after, I do not say; but this
much I say, that there is a “space
between death and the resurrection
of the body, and a state of the soul
in "happiness or in “misery until
the time which is appointed of God
that the dead shall come forth, and
be reunited, both soul and body,
and be “brought to stand before
God, and be judged according to
their works.

22 Yea, this bringeth about the
restoration of those things of which
has been spoken by the mouths of
the prophets.

23 The “soul shall be "restored to
the ‘body, and the body to the soul;
yea, and every limb and joint shall
be restored to its body; yea, even a
“hair of the head shall not be lost;
but all things shall be restored to
their proper and ‘perfect frame.

 

ALMA 40:19-41:2

24 And now, my son, this is the res-
toration of which has been “spoken
by the mouths of the prophets—

25 And then shall the “righteous
shine forth in the kingdom of God.

26 But behold, an awful “death
cometh upon the wicked; for they
die as to things pertaining to things
of righteousness; for they are un-
clean, and "no unclean thing can
inherit the kingdom of God; but
they are cast out, and consigned to
partake of the fruits of their labors
or their works, which have been
evil; and they drink the dregs ofa
bitter ‘cup.

CHAPTER 41

In the Resurrection men come forth to
a state of endless happiness or endless
misery—Wickedness never was happi-
ness—Carnal men are without God in
the world—Every person receives again
in the Restoration the characteristics
and attributes acquired in mortality.
About 74 B.c.

AND now, my son, I have somewhat
to say concerning the restoration of
which has been spoken; for behold,
some have “wrested the scriptures,
and have gone far ’astray because
of this thing. And I perceive that
thy mind has been ‘worried also
concerning this thing. But behold,
I will explain it unto thee.

2 [say unto thee, my son, that the
plan of restoration is requisite with
the justice of God; for it is requisite
that all things should be restored
to their proper order. Behold, it is
requisite and just, according to the
power and resurrection of Christ,

that the soul of man should be re-
stored to its body, and that every
“part of the body should be restored
to itself.

3 And it is requisite with the “jus-
tice of God that men should be
>judged according to their ‘works;
and if their works were good in this
life, and the desires of their hearts
were good, that they should also, at
the last day, be “restored unto that
which is good.

4 And if their works are evil they
shall be “restored unto them for evil.
Therefore, all things shall be ’re-
stored to their proper order, every
thing to its natural frame—mortality
raised to “immortality, ‘corruption
to incorruption—raised to ‘endless
happiness to “inherit the kingdom
of God, or to endless misery to in-
herit the kingdom of the devil, the
one on one hand, the other on the
other—

5 The one raised to “happiness ac-
cording to his desires of happiness,
or good according to his desires of
good; and the other to evil according
to his desires of evil; for as he has
desired to do evil all the day long
even so shall he have his reward of
evil when the night cometh.

6 And so it is on the other hand.
If he hath repented of his sins, and
desired righteousness until the end
of his days, even so he shall be re-
warded unto righteousness.

7 “These are they that are redeemed
of the Lord; yea, these are they that
are taken out, that are delivered from

310

that endless night of darkness; and
thus they stand or fall; for behold,
they are their own °judges, whether
to do good or do evil.

8 Now, the decrees of God are
“unalterable; therefore, the way is
prepared that whosoever will may
‘walk therein and be saved.

9 And now behold, my son, do not
risk “one more offense against your
God upon those points of doctrine,
which ye have hitherto risked to
commit sin.

10 Do not suppose, because it has
been spoken concerning restoration,
that ye shall be restored from sin to
happiness. Behold, I say unto you,
4wickedness never was "happiness.

11 And now, my son, all men that
are in a state of nature, or I would
say, ina carnal state, are in the ‘gall
of bitterness and in the “bonds of
iniquity; they are ‘without God in
the world, and they have gone /con-
trary to the nature of God; there-
fore, they are in a state contrary to
the nature of happiness.

12 And now behold, is the meaning
of the word restoration to take a
thing of a natural state and place it
in an unnatural state, or to place
it in a state opposite to its nature?

13 O, my son, this is not the case;
but the meaning of the word resto-
ration is to bring back again “evil
for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devil-
ish for devilish—good for that which
is good; righteous for that which is
righteous; just for that which is just;
merciful for that which is merciful.

14 Therefore, my son, see that you
are merciful unto your brethren;
deal “justly, "judge righteously, and
do ‘good continually; and if ye do
all these things then shall ye receive
your “reward; yea, ye shall have
‘mercy restored unto you again;
ye shall have justice restored unto
you again; ye shall have a righteous
judgment restored unto you again;
and ye shall have good rewarded
unto you again.

15 For that which ye do “send out
shall return unto you again, and be
restored; therefore, the word res-
toration more fully condemneth
the sinner, and justifieth him not
at all.

CHAPTER 42

Mortality is a probationary time to en-
able man to repent and serve God—The
Fall brought temporal and spiritual
death upon all mankind—Redemption
comes through repentance—God Himself
atones for the sins of the world—Mercy
is for those who repent—All others are
subject to God’s justice—Mercy comes
because of the Atonement—Only the
truly penitent are saved. About 74 B.C.

AND now, my son, I perceive there
is somewhat more which doth
worry your mind, which ye cannot
understand—which is concerning
the “justice of God in the °punish-
ment of the sinner; for ye do try
to suppose that it is ‘injustice that
the sinner should be consigned to
a state of misery.

2 Now behold, my son, I will explain
this thing unto thee. For behold,
after the Lord God sent our first

 

ALMA 41:14—42:8

parents forth from the garden of
“Eden, to till the "ground, from
whence they were taken—yea, he
drew out the man, and he placed at
the east end of the garden of Eden,
‘cherubim, and a flaming sword
which turned every way, to keep the
tree of life—

3 Now, we see that the man had
become as God, knowing good and
evil; and lest he should put forth
his hand, and take also of the tree
of life, and eat and live forever, the
Lord God placed ¢cherubim and the
flaming sword, that he should not
partake of the fruit—

4 And thus we see, that there was
a “time granted unto man to repent,
yea, a "probationary time, a time to
repent and serve God.

5 For behold, if Adam had put forth
his hand immediately, and “par-
taken of the "tree of life, he would
have lived forever, according to the
word of God, having no space for
repentance; yea, and also the word
of God would have been void, and
the great plan of salvation would
have been frustrated.

6 But behold, it was appointed
unto man to ¢die—therefore, as
they were cut off from the tree of
life they should be cut off from
the face of the earth—and man be-
came “lost forever, yea, they became
‘fallen man.

7 And now, ye see by this that
our first parents were “cut off both
temporally and spiritually from the
’presence of the Lord; and thus we
see they became subjects to follow
after their own ‘will.

8 Now behold, it was not expedient

that man should be reclaimed from
this “temporal death, for that would
destroy the great °plan of happiness.

9° Therefore, as the soul could never
die, and the “fall had brought upon
all mankind a spiritual 'death as
well as a temporal, that is, they
were cut off from the presence
of the Lord, it was expedient that
mankind should be reclaimed from
this spiritual death.

10 Therefore, as they had become
“carnal, sensual, and devilish, by
’nature, this ‘probationary state be-
came a state for them to prepare; it
became a preparatory state.

11 And now remember, my son,
if it were not for the plan of re-
demption, (laying it aside) as soon
as they were dead their souls were
*miserable, being cut off from the
presence of the Lord.

12 And now, there was no means
to reclaim men from this fallen
state, which *man had brought
upon himself because of his own
bdisobedience;

13 Therefore, according to justice,
the “plan of "redemption could not
be brought about, only on condi-
tions of repentance of men in this
probationary state, yea, this prepar-
atory state; for except it were for
these conditions, mercy could not
take effect except it should destroy
the work of justice. Now the work
of justice could not be destroyed;
if so, God would ‘cease to be God.

14 And thus we see that all man-
kind were “fallen, and they were in

 

312

the grasp of "justice; yea, the justice
of God, which consigned them for-
ever to be cut off from his presence.

15 And now, the plan of mercy
could not be brought about except
an atonement should be made;
therefore God himself ¢atoneth for
the sins of the world, to bring about
the plan of mercy, to appease the
demands of ‘justice, that God might
be a “perfect, just God, and a “mer-
ciful God also.

16 Now, repentance could not come
unto men except there were a “pun-
ishment, which also was ’eternal as
the life of the soul should be, af-
fixed ‘opposite to the plan of hap-
piness, which was as “eternal also
as the life of the soul.

17 Now, how could a man repent
except he should “sin? How could
he sin if there was no "law? How
could there be a law save there was
a punishment?

18 Now, there was a punishment
affixed, and a just law given, which
brought remorse of “conscience
unto man.

19 Now, if there was no law given—
ifa man “murdered he should "die—
would he be afraid he would die if
he should murder?

20 And also, if there was no law
given against sin men would not
be afraid to sin.

21 And if there was “no law given,
if men sinned what could justice
do, or mercy either, for they would
have no claim upon the creature?

22 But there is a law given, anda

“punishment affixed, and a ’repen-
tance granted; which repentance,
mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice
claimeth the creature and executeth
the ‘law, and the law inflicteth the
punishment; if not so, the works
of justice would be destroyed, and
God would cease to be God.

23 But God ceaseth not to be God,
and “mercy claimeth the penitent,
and mercy cometh because of the
batonement; and the atonement
bringeth to pass the ‘resurrection of
the dead; and the “resurrection
of the dead bringeth ‘back men
into the presence of God; and thus
they are restored into his presence,
to be ‘judged according to their
works, according to the law and
justice.

24 For behold, justice exerciseth
all his demands, and also “mercy
claimeth all which is her own; and
thus, none but the truly penitent
are saved.

25 What, do ye suppose that “mercy
can rob ’justice? I say unto you,
Nay; not one whit. If so, God would
cease to be God.

26 And thus God bringeth about
his great and eternal “purposes,
which were prepared ’from the
foundation of the world. And thus
cometh about the salvation and the
redemption of men, and also their
destruction and misery.

27 Therefore, O my son, ¢whoso-
ever will come may come and par-
take of the waters of life freely;
and whosoever will not come the
same is not compelled to come; but

 

ALMA 42:23-31

in the last day it shall be ’restored
unto him according to his ‘deeds.

28 If he has desired to do “evil,
and has not repented in his days,
behold, evil shall be done unto him,
according to the restoration of God.

29 And now, my son, I desire that
ye should let these things “trouble
you no more, and only let your
sins trouble you, with that trouble
which shall bring you down unto
repentance.

30 O my son, I desire that ye should
deny the “justice of God no more. Do
not endeavor to excuse yourself in
the least point because of your sins,
by denying the justice of God; but
do you let the justice of God, and
his "mercy, and his long-suffering
have full sway in your heart; and
let it bring you down to the dust
in ‘humility.

31 And now, O my son, ye are
called of God to “preach the word
unto this people. And now, my son,
go thy way, declare the word with
truth and soberness, that thou may-
est "bring souls unto repentance,
that the great plan of mercy may
have claim upon them. And may
God grant unto you even according
to my words. Amen.

reveals to Alma the strategy of the La-
manites—The Nephites defend their
homes, liberties, families, and reli-
gion—The armies of Moroni and Lehi
surround the Lamanites. About 74 B.C.

AND now it came to pass that the
sons of Alma did go forth among
the people, to declare the word
unto them, And Alma, also, himself,
could not “rest, and he also went
forth.

2 Now ¢we shall say no more con-
cerning their preaching, except
that they preached the word, and
the truth, according to the spirit
of prophecy and revelation; and
they preached after the "holy order
of God by which they were called.

3 And now 4 return to an "account
of the wars between the Nephites
and the Lamanites, in the eighteenth
year of the reign of the judges.

4 For behold, it came to pass that
the *Zoramites became Lamanites;
therefore, in the commencement
of the eighteenth year the people of
the Nephites saw that the Lamanites
were coming upon them; therefore
they made preparations for war;
yea, they gathered together their
armies in the land of Jershon.

5 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites came with their thou-
sands; and they came into the land
of “Antionum, which is the land of
the Zoramites; and a man by the
name of °Zerahemnah was their
leader.

6 And now, as the “Amalekites
were of a more wicked and mur-
derous disposition than the La-
manites were, in and of themselves,
therefore, Zerahemnah appointed
chief captains over the Lamanites,

 

314

and they were all Amalekites and
-Zoramites.

7 Now this he did that he might
preserve their “hatred towards the
Nephites, that he might bring them
into subjection to the accomplish-
ment of his designs.

8 For behold, his “designs were
to ’stir up the Lamanites to anger
against the Nephites; this he did
that he might usurp great power
over them, and also that he might
gain power over the Nephites by
bringing them into “bondage.

9 And now the design of the Neph-
ites was to support their lands, and
their houses, and their *wives,
and their children, that they might
preserve them from the hands of
their enemies; and also that they
might preserve their ’rights and
their privileges, yea, and also their
‘liberty, that they might worship
God according to their desires.

10 For they knew that if they
should fall into the hands of the
Lamanites, that whosoever should
“worship God in ’spirit and in truth,
the true and the living God, the La-
manites would “destroy.

11 Yea, and they also knew the
extreme hatred of the Lamanites
towards their “brethren, who were
the "people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi,
who were called the people of Am-
mon—and they would not take up
arms, yea, they had entered into a
covenant and they would not break
it—therefore, if they should fall
into the hands of the Lamanites
they would be destroyed.

12 And the Nephites would not suf-
fer that they should be destroyed;
therefore they gave them lands for
their inheritance.

13 And the people of Ammon did
give unto the Nephites a large por-
tion of their substance to “support
their armies; and thus the Nephites
were compelled, alone, to withstand
against the Lamanites, who werea
compound of Laman and Lemuel,
and the sons of Ishmael, and all
those who had dissented from the
Nephites, who were Amalekites and
Zoramites, and the °descendants of
the priests of Noah.

14 Now those descendants were
as numerous, nearly, as were the
Nephites; and thus the Nephites
were obliged to contend with their
brethren, even unto bloodshed.

15 And it came to pass as the
armies of the Lamanites had gath-
ered together in the land of Antio-
num, behold, the armies of the
Nephites were prepared to meet
them in the “land of Jershon.

16 Now, the leader of the Neph-
ites, or the man who had been 4ap-
pointed to be the ’chief captain
over the Nephites—now the chief
captain took the command of all
the armies of the Nephites—and
his name was Moroni;

17 And Moroni took all the com-
mand, and the government of their
wars. And he was only twenty
and five years old when he was
appointed chief captain over the
armies of the Nephites.

18 And it came to pass that he met
the Lamanites in the borders of Jer-
shon, and his people were armed
with swords, and with cimeters,
and all manner of “weapons of war.

19 And when the armies of the
Lamanites saw that the people of
Nephi, or that Moroni, had “pre-
pared his people with "breastplates
and with arm-shields, yea, and also
shields to defend their heads, and

 

ALMA 43:13-24

also they were dressed with thick
clothing—

20 Now the army of Zerahemnah
was not prepared with any such
thing; they had only their ¢swords
and their cimeters, their bows and
their arrows, their °stones and their
slings; and they were ‘naked, save
it were a skin which was girded
about their loins; yea, all were na-
ked, save it were the Zoramites and
the Amalekites;

21 But they were not armed with
breastplates, nor shields—therefore,
they were exceedingly afraid of the
armies of the Nephites because of
their armor, notwithstanding their
number being so much greater than
the Nephites.

22 Behold, now it came to pass
that they durst not come against
the Nephites in the borders of Jer-
shon; therefore they departed out
of the land of Antionum into the
wilderness, and took their journey
round about in the wilderness, away
by the head of the river Sidon, that
they might come into the land of
*Manti and take possession of the
land; for they did not suppose that
the armies of Moroni would know
whither they had gone.

23 But it came to pass, as soon as
they had departed into the wilder-
ness Moroni sent spies into the wil-
derness to watch their camp; and
Moroni, also, knowing of the prophe-
cies of Alma, sent certain men unto
him, desiring him that he should
“inquire of the Lord 'whither the
armies of the Nephites should go
to defend themselves against the
Lamanites.

24 And it came to pass that the
“word of the Lord came unto Alma,
and Alma informed the messengers
of Moroni, that the armies of the

Lamanites were marching round
about in the wilderness, that they
might come over into the land of
Manti, that they might commence
an attack upon the weaker part of
the people. And those messengers
went and delivered the message
unto Moroni.

25 Now Moroni, leaving a part of
his army in the land of Jershon,
lest by any means a part of the
Lamanites should come into that
land and take possession of the city,
took the remaining part of his army
and marched over into the land
of Manti.

26 And he caused that all the
people in that quarter of the land
should gather themselves together
to battle against the Lamanites, to
defend their lands and their coun-
try, their rights and their liber-
ties; therefore they were prepared
against the time of the coming of
the Lamanites.

27 And it came to pass that Mo-
roni caused that his army should
be secreted in the valley which was
near the bank of the river Sidon,
which was on the west of the river
Sidon in the wilderness.

28 And Moroni placed spies round
about, that he might know when
the camp of the Lamanites should
come.

29 And now, as Moroni knew the
“intention of the Lamanites, that it
was their intention to destroy their
brethren, or to "subject them and
bring them into bondage that they
might establish a kingdom unto
themselves over all the land;

30 And he also knowing that it
was the “only desire of the Nephites
to preserve their lands, and their
‘liberty, and their church, therefore
he thought it no sin that he should
defend them by ‘stratagem; there-
fore, he found by his spies which
course the Lamanites were to take.

 

316

31 Therefore, he divided his army
and brought a part over into the
valley, and “concealed them on the
east, and on the south of the hill
Riplah;

32 And the remainder he concealed
in the west “valley, on the west of
the river Sidon, and so down into
the borders of the land Manti.

33 And thus having placed his
army according to his desire, he
was prepared to meet them.

34 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites came up on the north of
the hill, where a part of the army
of Moroni was concealed.

35 And as the Lamanites had
passed the hill Riplah, and came
into the valley, and began to cross
the river Sidon, the army which
was concealed on the south of the
hill, which was led by a man whose
name was “Lehi, and he led his army
forth and encircled the Lamanites
about on the east in their rear.

36 And it came to pass that the La-
manites, when they saw the Neph-
ites coming upon them in their
rear, turned them about and began
to contend with the army of Lehi.

37 And the work of death com-
menced on both sides, but it was
more dreadful on the part of the
Lamanites, for their “nakedness
was exposed to the heavy blows
of the Nephites with their swords
and their cimeters, which brought
death almost at every stroke.

38 While on the other hand, there
was now and then a man fell among
the Nephites, by their swords and
the loss of blood, they being shielded
from the more vital parts of the
body, or the more vital parts of
the body being shielded from the
strokes of the Lamanites, by their
*breastplates, and their armshields,
and their head-plates; and thus the
Nephites did carry on the work of
death among the Lamanites.

39 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites became frightened, be-
cause of the great destruction among
them, even until they began to flee
towards the river Sidon.

40 And they were pursued by Lehi
and his men; and they were driven
by Lehi into the waters of Sidon,
and they crossed the waters of Si-
don. And Lehi retained his armies
upon the bank of the river Sidon
that they should not cross.

41 And it came to pass that Moroni
and his army met the Lamanites in
the “valley, on the other side of the
river Sidon, and began to fall upon
them and to slay them.

42 And the Lamanites did flee
again before them, towards the land
of Manti; and they were met again
by the armies of Moroni.

43 Now in this case the Lamanites
did fight exceedingly; yea, never
had the Lamanites been known to
fight with such exceedingly great
strength and courage, no, not even
from the beginning.

44 And they were inspired by the
*Zoramites and the Amalekites, who
were their chief captains and lead-
ers, and by Zerahemnah, who was
their chief captain, or their chief
leader and commander; yea, they did
fight like dragons, and many of the
Nephites were slain by their hands,
yea, for they did smite in two many
of their head-plates, and they did
pierce many of their breastplates,
and they did smite off many of their
arms; and thus the Lamanites did
smite in their fierce anger.

45 Nevertheless, the Nephites were
inspired by a “better cause, for they
were not fighting for monarchy
nor power but they were fighting
for their homes and their ‘liberties,

 

ALMA 43:39-51

their wives and their children, and
their all, yea, for their rites of wor-
ship and their church.

46 And they were doing that which
they felt was the ¢duty which they
owed to their God; for the Lord had
said unto them, and also unto their
fathers, that: "Inasmuch as ye are
not guilty of the ‘first offense, nei-
ther the second, ye shall not suffer
yourselves to be slain by the hands
of your enemies.

47 And again, the Lord has said
that: Ye shall ¢defend your families
even unto °bloodshed. Therefore
for this cause were the Nephites
contending with the Lamanites, to
defend themselves, and their fami-
lies, and their lands, their country,
and their rights, and their religion.

48 And it came to pass that when
the men of Moroni saw the fierce-
ness and the anger of the Lamanites,
they were about to shrink and flee
from them. And Moroni, perceiving
their intent, sent forth and inspired
their hearts with these thoughts—
yea, the thoughts of their lands,
their liberty, yea, their freedom
from bondage.

49 And it came to pass that they
turned upon the Lamanites, and
they ‘cried with one voice unto
the Lord their God, for their “liberty
and their freedom from bondage.

50 And they “began to stand
against the Lamanites with power;
and in that selfsame hour that they
cried unto the Lord for their free-
dom, the Lamanites began to flee
before them; and they fled even to
the waters of Sidon.

51 Now, the Lamanites were more
“numerous, yea, by more than
double the number of the Neph-
ites; nevertheless, they were driven

insomuch that they were gathered
together in one body in the valley,
upon the bank by the river Sidon.

52 Therefore the armies of Moroni
encircled them about, yea, even
on both sides of the river, for be-
hold, on the east were the men of
Lehi.

53 Therefore when Zerahemnah
saw the men of Lehi on the east of
the river Sidon, and the armies of
Moroni on the west of the river Si-
don, that they were encircled about
by the Nephites, they were struck
with terror.

54 Now Moroni, when he saw their
“terror, commanded his men that
they should stop shedding their
blood.

CHAPTER 44

Moroni commands the Lamanites to
make a covenant of peace or be de-
stroyed—Zerahemnah rejects the offer,
and the battle resumes—Moroni’s armies
defeat the Lamanites. About 74-73 B.c.

AND it came to pass that they did
stop and withdrew a pace from
them. And Moroni said unto “Zera-
hemnah: Behold, Zerahemnah, that
we do ’not desire to be men of blood.
Ye know that ye are in our hands,
yet we do not desire to slay you.

2 Behold, we have not come out
to battle against you that we might
shed your blood for power; neither
do we desire to bring any one to
the “yoke of bondage. But this is
the ’very cause for which ye have
come against us; yea, and ye are an-
ery with us because of our religion.

3 But now, ye behold that the Lord
is with us; and ye behold that he
has delivered you into our hands.
And now I would that ye should
understand that this is done unto
us “because of our religion and
our faith in Christ. And now ye

 

318

see that ye cannot destroy this
our faith.

4 Now ye see that this is the true
faith of God; yea, ye see that God
will support, and keep, and preserve
us, so long as we are “faithful unto
him, and unto our faith, and our
religion; and never will the Lord
suffer that we shall be destroyed
except we should fall into trans-
gression and deny our faith.

5 And now, Zerahemnah, I com-
mand you, in the name of that
all-powerful God, who has strength-
ened our arms that we have gained
power over you, “by our faith, by
our religion, and by our "rites of
worship, and by our church, and by
the sacred support which we owe
to our ‘wives and our children, by
that “liberty which binds us to our
lands and our country; yea, and also
by the maintenance of the sacred
word of God, to which we owe all
our happiness; and by all that is
most dear unto us—

6 Yea, and this is not all; I com-
mand you by all the desires which
ye have for life, that ye ¢deliver up
your weapons of war unto us, and
we will seek not your blood, but we
will "spare your lives, if ye will go
your way and come not again to
war against us.

7 And now, if ye do not this, be-
hold, ye are in our hands, and I
will command my men that they
shall fall upon you, and “inflict the
wounds of death in your bodies, that
ye may become extinct; and then
we will see who shall have power
over this people; yea, we will see
who shall be brought into bondage.

8 And now it came to pass that
when Zerahemnah had heard these
sayings he came forth and delivered
up his “sword and his cimeter, and
his bow into the hands of Moroni,
and said unto him: Behold, here are

our weapons of war; we will deliver
them up unto you, but we will not
suffer ourselves to take an “oath
unto you, which we know that we
shall break, and also our children;
but take our weapons of war, and
suffer that we may depart into the
wilderness; otherwise we will re-
tain our swords, and we will perish
or conquer.

9 Behold, we are “not of your faith;
we do not believe that it is God that
has delivered us into your hands; but
we believe that it is your cunning
that has preserved you from our
swords, Behold, it is your °breast-
plates and your shields that have
preserved you.

10 And now when Zerahemnah
had made an end of speaking these
words, Moroni returned the sword
and the weapons of war, which he
had received, unto Zerahemnah,
saying: Behold, we will end the
conflict.

11 Now I cannot recall the words
which I have spoken, therefore
as the Lord liveth, ye shall not
depart except ye depart with an
oath that ye will not return again
against us to war. Now as ye are in
our hands we will spill your blood
upon the ground, or ye shall sub-
mit to the conditions which I have
proposed.

12 And now when Moroni had said
these words, Zerahemnah retained
his sword, and he was angry with
Moroni, and he rushed forward
that he might slay Moroni; but as
he raised his sword, behold, one of
Moroni’s soldiers smote it even to
the earth, and it broke by the hilt;
and he also smote Zerahemnah that
he took off his scalp and it fell to
the earth. And Zerahemnah with-
drew from before them into the
midst of his soldiers.

13 And it came to pass that the
soldier who stood by, who smote
off the scalp of Zerahemnah, took
up the scalp from off the ground by

 

ALMA 44:9-19

the hair, and laid it upon the point
of his sword, and stretched it forth
unto them, saying unto them with
a loud voice:

14 Even as this scalp has fallen
to the earth, which is the scalp of
your chief, so shall ye fall to the
earth except ye will deliver up your
weapons of war and depart witha
covenant of peace.

15 Now there were many, when
they heard these words and saw
the scalp which was upon the
sword, that were struck with fear;
and many came forth and threw
down their weapons of war at
the feet of Moroni, and entered
into a “covenant of peace. And as
many as entered into a covenant
they suffered to *depart into the
wilderness.

16 Now it came to pass that Zera-
hemnah was exceedingly wroth,
and he did stir up the remainder
of his soldiers to anger, to con-
tend more powerfully against the
Nephites.

17 And now Moroni was angry,
because of the stubbornness of
the Lamanites; therefore he com-
manded his people that they should
fall upon them and slay them. And
it came to pass that they began to
slay them; yea, and the Lamanites
did contend with their swords and
their might.

18 But behold, their naked skins
and their bare heads were exposed
to the sharp swords of the Nephites;
yea, behold they were pierced and
smitten, yea, and did fall exceed-
ingly fast before the swords of the
Nephites; and they began to be
swept down, even as the soldier of
Moroni had prophesied.

19 Now Zerahemnah, when he
saw that they were all about to
be destroyed, cried mightily unto
Moroni, promising that he would
covenant and also his people with
them, if they would spare the re-
mainder of their lives, that they

“never would come to war again
against them.

20 And it came to pass that Moroni
caused that the work of death should
“cease again among the people. And
he took the weapons of war from
the Lamanites; and after they had
entered into a "covenant with him
of peace they were suffered to de-
part into the wilderness.

21 Now the number of their dead
was not numbered because of the
greatness of the number; yea, the
number of their dead was exceed-
ingly great, both on the Nephites
and on the Lamanites.

22 And it came to pass that they
did cast their dead into the waters
of Sidon, and they have gone forth
and are buried in the depths of
the “sea.

23 And the armies of the Nephites,
or of Moroni, returned and came to
their houses and their lands.

24 And thus ended the eighteenth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi. And thus ended
the record of Alma, which was writ-
ten upon the plates of Nephi.

The account of the people of Nephi,
and their wars and dissensions, in
the days of Helaman, according to
the record of Helaman, which he
kept in his days.

Comprising chapters 45 through 62.

CHAPTER 45

Helaman believes the words of Alma—
Alma prophesies the destruction of the
Nephites—He blesses and curses the
land—Alma may have been taken up
by the Spirit, even as Moses—Dissen-
sion grows in the Church. About 73 B.C.

BEHOLD, now it came to pass that the

 

320

people of Nephi were exceedingly
rejoiced, because the Lord had again
“delivered them out of the hands of
their enemies; therefore they gave
thanks unto the Lord their God; yea,
and they did °fast much and pray
much, and they did worship God
with exceedingly great joy.

2 And it came to pass in the nine-
teenth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi, that Alma
came unto his son Helaman and
said unto him: Believest thou the
words which I spake unto thee con-
cerning those “records which have
been kept?

3 And Helaman said unto him:
Yea, I “believe.

4 And Alma said again: Believest
thou in Jesus Christ, who shall come?

5 And he said: Yea, I believe all
the words which thou hast spoken.

6 And Alma said unto him again:
Will ye “keep my commandments?

7 And he said: Yea, I will keep thy
commandments with all my heart.

8 Then Alma said unto him: Blessed
art thou; and the Lord shall “pros-
per thee in this land.

9 But behold, I have somewhat
to *prophesy unto thee; but what
I prophesy unto thee ye shall not
make known; yea, what I prophesy
unto thee shall not be made known,
even until the prophecy is fulfilled;
therefore write the words which I
shall say.

10 And these are the words: Be-
hold, I perceive that this very peo-
ple, the Nephites, according to the
spirit of revelation which is in me,
in “four hundred years from the
time that Jesus Christ shall manifest
himself unto them, shall dwindle in
bunbelief.

11 Yea, and then shall they see
wars and pestilences, yea, fam-
ines and bloodshed, even until the

people of Nephi shall become
*4extinct—

12 Yea, and this because they
shall dwindle in unbelief and fall
into the works of darkness, and
“lasciviousness, and all manner of
iniquities; yea, I say unto you, that
because they shall sin against so
great light and knowledge, yea, I say
unto you, that from that day, even
the *fourth generation shall not all
pass away before this great iniquity
shall come.

13 And when that great day
cometh, behold, the time very soon
cometh that those who are now, or
the seed of those who are now num-
bered among the people of Nephi,
shall ¢no more be numbered among
the people of Nephi.

14 But whosoever remaineth, and
is not destroyed in that great and
dreadful day, shall be “numbered
among the "Lamanites, and shall
become like unto them, all, save
it be a few who shall be called the
disciples of the Lord; and them
shall the Lamanites pursue even
‘until they shall become extinct.
And now, because of iniquity, this
prophecy shall be fulfilled.

15 And now it came to pass that
after Alma had said these things to
Helaman, he “blessed him, and also
his other sons; and he also blessed
the earth for the ’righteous’ sake.

16 And he said: Thus saith the Lord
God—Cursed shall be the land,
yea, this land, unto every nation,
kindred, tongue, and people, unto
destruction, which do °wickedly,
when they are fully ripe; and as I
have said so shall it be; for this is
the cursing and the “blessing of God
upon the land, for the Lord cannot

 

ALMA 45:12-22

look upon sin with the “least degree
of allowance.

17 And now, when Alma had said
these words he blessed the ¢church,
yea, all those who should stand fast
in the faith from that time hence-
forth.

18 And when Alma had done this
he “departed out of the land of Zara-
hemla, as if to go into the land of
’Melek. And it came to pass that
he was never heard of more; as to
his death or burial we know not of.

19 Behold, this we know, that he
was a righteous man; and the say-
ing went abroad in the church that
he was taken up by the “Spirit, or
’buried by the hand of the Lord,
even as Moses. But behold, the scrip-
tures saith the Lord took Moses unto
himself; and we suppose that he
has also received Alma in the spirit,
unto himself; therefore, for this
cause we know nothing concerning
his death and burial.

20 And now it came to pass in the
commencement of the nineteenth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi, that Helaman
went forth among the people to de-
clare the “word unto them,

21 For behold, because of their
wars with the Lamanites and the
many little dissensions and distur-
bances which had been among the
people, it became expedient that the
*word of God should be declared
among them, yea, and that a ’regu-
lation should be made throughout
the church,

22 Therefore, “Helaman and his
brethren went forth to establish the
church again in all the land, yea, in
every city throughout all the land
which was possessed by the people

of Nephi. And it came to pass that
they did appoint ’priests and ‘teach-
ers throughout all the land, over all
the churches.

23 And now it came to pass that
after Helaman and his brethren
had appointed priests and teachers
over the churches that there arosea
“dissension among them, and they
would not give heed to the words
of Helaman and his brethren;

24 But they grew proud, being
lifted up in their hearts, because
of their exceedingly great “riches;
therefore they grew rich in their
own eyes, and would not give heed
to their words, to "walk uprightly
before God.

CHAPTER 46

Amalickiah conspires to be king—Mo-
roni raises the title of liberty—He rallies
the people to defend their religion—
True believers are called Christians—A
remnant of Joseph will be preserved—
Amalickiah and the dissenters flee to
the land of Nephi—Those who will not
support the cause of freedom are put to
death. About 73-72 B.c.

AND it came to pass that as many
as would not hearken to the *words
of Helaman and his brethren were
gathered together against their
brethren.

2 And now behold, they were ex-
ceedingly wroth, insomuch that
they were determined to slay them.

3 Now the leader of those who
were wroth against their brethren
was a large and a strong man; and
his name was “Amalickiah.

4 And Amalickiah was desirous to
be a “king; and those people who
were wroth were also desirous that

322

he should be their king; and they
were the greater part of them the
lower "judges of the land, and they
were seeking for power.

5 And they had been led by the
*flatteries of Amalickiah, that if they
would support him and establish
him to be their king that he would
make them rulers over the people.

6 Thus they were led away by
Amalickiah to dissensions, notwith-
standing the preaching of Helaman
and his brethren, yea, notwith-
standing their exceedingly great
care over the church, for they were
“high priests over the church.

7 And there were many in the
church who believed in the @flat-
tering words of Amalickiah, there-
fore they dissented even from the
church; and thus were the affairs
of the people of Nephi exceed-
ingly precarious and dangerous,
notwithstanding their great ‘vic-
tory which they had had over the
Lamanites, and their great rejoic-
ings which they had had because
of their “deliverance by the hand of
the Lord.

8 Thus we see how “quick the chil-
dren of men do ’forget the Lord their
God, yea, how quick to do ‘iniquity,
and to be led away by the evil one.

9 Yea, and we also see the great
“wickedness one very wicked man
can cause to take place among the
children of men.

10 Yea, we see that Amalickiah,
because he was a man of cunning
device and aman of many flattering
words, that he led away the hearts
of many people to do wickedly; yea,
and to seek to “destroy the church of
God, and to destroy the foundation
of "liberty which God had granted

unto them, or which blessing God
had sent upon the face of the land
for the ‘righteous’ sake.

11 And now it came to pass that
when Moroni, who was the “chief
commander of the armies of the
Nephites, had heard of these dis-
sensions, he was angry with Amal-
ickiah.

12 And it came to pass that he rent
his coat; and he took a piece thereof,
and wrote upon it—*In memory of
our God, our religion, and freedom,
and our peace, our wives, and our
children—and he fastened it upon
the end of a pole.

13 And he fastened on his head-
plate, and his “breastplate, and his
shields, and girded on his armor
about his loins; and he took the pole,
which had on the end thereof his
rent coat, (and he called it the title
of liberty) and he ‘bowed himself
to the earth, and he prayed might-
ily unto his God for the blessings
of liberty to rest upon his breth-
ren, so long as there should a band
of “Christians remain to possess
the land—

14 For thus were all the true be-
lievers of Christ, who belonged
to the church of God, called by
those who did not belong to the
church,

15 And those who did belong to
the church were “faithful; yea, all
those who were true believers in
Christ took upon them, gladly, the
name of Christ, or ‘Christians as
they were called, because of their
belief in Christ who should come.

16 And therefore, at this time,
Moroni prayed that the cause of the

 

ALMA 46:11-21

Christians, and the “freedom of the
land might be favored.

17 And it came to pass that when
he had poured out his soul to God,
he named all the land which was
“south of the land "Desolation, yea,
and in fine, all the land, both on the
‘north and on the south—A chosen
land, and the land of “liberty.

18 And he said: Surely God shall
not “suffer that we, who are despised
because we take upon us the name
of Christ, shall be trodden down and
destroyed, until we bring it upon us
by our own "transgressions.

19 And when Moroni had said
these words, he went forth among
the people, waving the “rent part of
his garment in the air, that all might
see the writing which he had writ-
ten upon the rent part, and crying
with a loud voice, saying:

20 Behold, whosoever will main-
tain this title upon the land, let
them come forth in the strength
of the Lord, and “enter into a cov-
enant that they will "maintain their
rights, and their religion, that the
Lord God may bless them.

21 And it came to pass that when
Moroni had proclaimed these words,
behold, the people came running
“together with their armor girded
about their loins, ’rending their gar-
ments in token, or as a ‘covenant,
that they would not forsake the
Lord their God; or, in other words,
if they should transgress the com-
mandments of God, or fall into
transgression, and be “ashamed to
take upon them the name of Christ,
the Lord should rend them even as
they had rent their garments.

22 Now this was the covenant
which they made, and they “cast
their garments at the feet of Moroni,
saying: We ’covenant with our God,
that we shall be destroyed, even as
our brethren in the land northward,
if we shall fall into transgression;
yea, he may cast us at the feet of
our enemies, even as we have cast
our garments at thy feet to be trod-
den under foot, if we shall fall into
transgression.

23 Moroni said unto them: Behold,
we are a “remnant of the seed of Ja-
cob; yea, we are a remnant of the
seed of Joseph, whose ‘coat was rent
by his brethren into many pieces;
yea, and now behold, let us remem-
ber to keep the commandments of
God, or our garments shall be rent
by our brethren, and we be cast
into prison, or be sold, or be slain.

24 Yea, let us preserve our liberty
as a*remnant of Joseph; yea, let us
remember the words of Jacob, be-
fore his death, for behold, he saw
that a "part of the ‘remnant of the
coat of Joseph was “preserved and
had not decayed. And he said—Even
as this remnant of garment of my
son hath been preserved, so shalla
‘remnant of the seed of my son be
preserved by the hand of God, and
be taken unto himself, while the re-
mainder of the seed of Joseph shall
perish, even as the remnant of his
garment.

25 Now behold, this giveth my soul
sorrow; nevertheless, my soul hath
joy in my son, because of that part
of his seed which shall be taken
unto God.

26 Now behold, this was the lan-
guage of Jacob.

27 And now who knoweth but what
the remnant of the seed of Joseph,
which shall perish as his garment,
are those who have dissented from

 

324

us? Yea, and even it shall be our-
selves if we do not stand fast in the
faith of Christ.

28 And now it came to pass that
when Moroni had said these words
he went forth, and also sent forth
in all the parts of the land where
there were dissensions, and gathered
together all the people who were
desirous to maintain their liberty,
to stand against Amalickiah and
those who had dissented, who were
called Amalickiahites.

29 And it came to pass that when
Amalickiah saw that the people of
Moroni were more numerous than
the Amalickiahites—and he also
saw that his people were ‘doubtful
concerning the justice of the cause
in which they had undertaken—
therefore, fearing that he should
not gain the point, he took those of
his people who would and departed
into the ‘land of Nephi.

30 Now Moroni thought it was not
expedient that the Lamanites should
have any more “strength; therefore
he thought to cut off the people of
Amalickiah, or to take them and
bring them back, and put Amalick-
iah to death; yea, for he knew that
he would stir up the Lamanites to
anger against them, and cause them
to come to battle against them;
and this he knew that Amalickiah
would do that he might obtain his
purposes.

31 Therefore Moroni thought it
was expedient that he should
take his armies, who had gathered
themselves together, and armed
themselves, and entered into a cov-
enant to keep the peace—and it
came to pass that he took his army
and marched out with his tents into
the wilderness, to cut off the course
of Amalickiah in the wilderness.

32 And it came to pass that he did

according to his desires, and marched
forth into the wilderness, and
headed the armies of Amalickiah.

33 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah “fled with a small number of
his men, and the remainder were
delivered up into the hands of Mo-
roni and were taken back into the
land of Zarahemla.

34 Now, Moroni being a man who
was “appointed by the chief judges
and the voice of the people, there-
fore he had power according to his
will with the armies of the Neph-
ites, to establish and to exercise
authority over them.

35 And it came to pass that whom-
soever of the Amalickiahites that
would not enter into a covenant to
support the “cause of freedom, that
they might maintain a free ’govern-
ment, he caused to be put to death;
and there were but few who denied
the covenant of freedom.

36 And it came to pass also, that
he caused the “title of liberty to be
hoisted upon every tower which was
in all the land, which was possessed
by the Nephites; and thus Moroni
planted the standard of liberty
among the Nephites.

37 And they began to have peace
again in the land; and thus they did
maintain peace in the land until
nearly the end of the nineteenth
year of the reign of the judges.

38 And Helaman and the “high
priests did also maintain order in
the church; yea, even for the space
of four years did they have much
peace and rejoicing in the church.

39 And it came to pass that there
were many who died, firmly “believ-
ing that their souls were redeemed
by the Lord Jesus Christ; thus they
went out of the world rejoicing.

40 And there were some who died

 

ALMA 46:33-47:3

with fevers, which at some seasons
of the year were very frequent in
the land—but not so much so with
fevers, because of the excellent
qualities of the many “plants and
roots which God had prepared to re-
move the cause of "diseases, to which
men were subject by the nature of
the climate—

41 But there were many who died
with “old age; and those who died
in the faith of Christ are "happy in
him, as we must needs suppose.

CHAPTER 47

Amalickiah uses treachery, murder,
and intrigue to become king of the La-
manites—The Nephite dissenters are
more wicked and ferocious than the
Lamanites. About 72 B.c.

Now we will return in our record
to Amalickiah and those who had
“fled with him into the wilderness;
for, behold, he had taken those who
went with him, and went up in the
’land of Nephi among the Laman-
ites, and did ‘stir up the Lamanites
to anger against the people of
Nephi, insomuch that the king of
the Lamanites sent a proclamation
throughout all his land, among all
his people, that they should gather
themselves together again to go to
battle against the Nephites.

2 And it came to pass that when
the proclamation had gone forth
among them they were exceedingly
afraid; yea, they “feared to displease
the king, and they also feared to go
to battle against the Nephites lest
they should lose their lives. And it
came to pass that they would not,
or the more part of them would
not, obey the commandments of
the king.

3 And now it came to pass that

the king was wroth because of
their disobedience; therefore he
gave Amalickiah the command of
that part of his army which was
obedient unto his commands, and
commanded him that he should go
forth and “compel them to arms.

4 Now behold, this was the desire
of Amalickiah; for he being a very
“subtle man to do evil therefore he
laid the plan in his heart to ’de-
throne the king of the Lamanites.

5 And now he had got the com-
mand of those parts of the Laman-
ites who were in favor of the king;
and he sought to gain favor of those
who were not obedient; therefore
he went forward to the place which
was called “Onidah, for thither had
all the Lamanites fled; for they
discovered the army coming, and,
supposing that they were coming to
destroy them, therefore they fled to
Onidah, to the place of arms.

6 And they had appointed a man
to be a king and a leader over them,
being fixed in their minds with
a determined resolution that they
would “not be subjected to go
against the Nephites.

7 And it came to pass that they
had gathered themselves together
upon the top of the mount which
was called Antipas, in preparation
to battle.

8 Now it was not Amalickiah’s in-
tention to give them battle accord-
ing to the commandments of the
king; but behold, it was his inten-
tion to gain favor with the armies of
the Lamanites, that he might place
himself at their head and dethrone
the king and take possession of the
kingdom.

9 And behold, it came to pass that
he caused his army to pitch their
tents in the valley which was near
the mount Antipas.

10 And it came to pass that when it
was night he sent a secret embassy
into the mount Antipas, desiring

 

326

that the leader of those who were
upon the mount, whose name was
Lehonti, that he should come down
to the foot of the mount, for he de-
sired to speak with him.

11 And it came to pass that when
Lehonti received the message he
durst not go down to the foot of
the mount. And it came to pass that
Amalickiah sent again the second
time, desiring him to come down.
And it came to pass that Lehonti
would not; and he sent again the
third time.

12 And it came to pass that when
Amalickiah found that he could
not get Lehonti to come down off
from the mount, he went up into
the mount, nearly to Lehonti’s camp;
and he sent again the fourth time
his message unto Lehonti, desiring
that he would come down, and that
he would bring his guards with him.

13 And it came to pass that when
Lehonti had come down with his
guards to Amalickiah, that Amal-
ickiah desired him to come down
with his army in the night-time, and
surround those men in their camps
over whom the king had given him
command, and that he would deliver
them up into Lehonti’s hands, if he
would make him (Amalickiah) a
second “leader over the whole army.

14 And it came to pass that Lehonti
came down with his men and sur-
rounded the men of Amalickiah, so
that before they awoke at the dawn
of day they were surrounded by the
armies of Lehonti.

15 And it came to pass that when
they saw that they were surrounded,
they pled with Amalickiah that he
would suffer them to fall in with
their brethren, that they might not
be destroyed. Now this was the very
thing which Amalickiah desired.

16 And it came to pass that he
delivered his men, “contrary to
the commands of the king. Now
this was the thing that Amalickiah

desired, that he might accomplish
his designs in dethroning the king.

17 Now it was the custom among
the Lamanites, if their chief leader
was killed, to appoint the second
leader to be their chief leader.

18 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah caused that one of his ser-
vants should administer “poison by
degrees to Lehonti, that he died.

19 Now, when Lehonti was dead,
the Lamanites appointed Amalick-
iah to be their leader and their chief
commander.

20 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah marched with his armies (for
he had gained his desires) to the
“land of Nephi, to the city of Nephi,
which was the chief city.

21 And the king came out to meet
him with his guards, for he supposed
that Amalickiah had fulfilled his
commands, and that Amalickiah
had gathered together so great an
army to go against the Nephites
to battle.

22 But behold, as the king came
out to meet him Amalickiah caused
that his servants should go forth to
meet the king. And they went and
“bowed themselves before the king,
as if to reverence him because of
his greatness.

23 And it came to pass that the
king put forth his hand to raise
them, as was the custom with the La-
manites, as a token of peace, which
custom they had taken from the
Nephites.

24 And it came to pass that when
he had raised the first from the
ground, behold he stabbed the king
to the heart; and he fell to the earth.

25 Now the servants of the king
fled; and the servants of Amalick-
iah raised a cry, saying:

26 Behold, the servants of the king
have stabbed him to the heart, and
he has fallen and they have fled;
behold, come and see.

27 And it came to pass that

 

ALMA 47:17-34

Amalickiah commanded that his
armies should march forth and see
what had happened to the king; and
when they had come to the spot, and
found the king lying in his gore,
Amalickiah pretended to be wroth,
and said: Whosoever loved the king,
let him go forth, and pursue his ser-
vants that they may be slain.

28 And it came to pass that all
they who loved the king, when
they heard these words, came forth
and pursued after the servants of
the king.

29 Now when the “servants of the
king saw an army pursuing after
them, they were frightened again,
and fled into the wilderness, and
came over into the land of Zara-
hemla and joined the ’people of
Ammon.

30 And the army which pursued
after them returned, having pur-
sued after them in vain; and thus
Amalickiah, by his *fraud, gained
the hearts of the people.

31 And it came to pass on the mor-
row he entered the city Nephi with
his armies, and took possession of
the city.

32 And now it came to pass that the
queen, when she had heard that
the king was slain—for Amalickiah
had sent an embassy to the queen
informing her that the king had
been slain by his servants, that he
had pursued them with his army,
but it was in vain, and they had
made their escape—

33 Therefore, when the queen had
received this message she sent unto
Amalickiah, desiring him that he
would spare the people of the city;
and she also desired him that he
should come in unto her; and she
also desired him that he should
bring *witnesses with him to testify
concerning the death of the king.

34 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah took the same servant that
slew the king, and all them who

were with him, and went in unto
the queen, unto the place where
she sat; and they all “testified unto
her that the king was slain by his
own servants; and they said also:
They have fled; does not this tes-
tify against them? And thus they
satisfied the queen concerning the
death of the king.

35 And it came to pass that Amal-
ickiah sought the “favor of the
queen, and took her unto him to
wife; and thus by his °fraud, and by
the assistance of his cunning ser-
vants, he ‘obtained the kingdom; yea,
he was acknowledged king through-
out all the land, among all the
people of the Lamanites, who were
4composed of the Lamanites and
the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites,
and all the dissenters of the Neph-
ites, from the reign of Nephi down
to the present time.

36 Now these “dissenters, having
the same instruction and the same
information of the Nephites, yea,
having been instructed in the same
’knowledge of the Lord, neverthe-
less, it is strange to relate, not long
after their dissensions they became
more hardened and ‘impenitent, and
more wild, wicked and ferocious
than the Lamanites—drinking in
with the “traditions of the Laman-
ites; giving way to “indolence, and
all manner of lasciviousness; yea, en-
tirely forgetting the Lord their God.

CHAPTER 48

Amalickiah incites the Lamanites
against the Nephites—Moroni prepares
his people to defend the cause of the
Christians—He rejoices in liberty and
freedom and is a mighty man of God.
About 72 B.C.

 

328

AND now it came to pass that, as
soon as “Amalickiah had obtained
the kingdom he began to "inspire the
hearts of the Lamanites against
the people of Nephi; yea, he did
appoint men to speak unto the La-
manites from their ‘towers, against
the Nephites.

2 And thus he did inspire their
hearts against the Nephites, inso-
much that in the latter end of the
“nineteenth year of the reign of
the judges, he having accomplished
his designs thus far, yea, having been
made king over the Lamanites, he
’sought also to ‘reign over all the
land, yea, and all the people who
were in the land, the Nephites as
well as the Lamanites.

3 Therefore he had accomplished
his design, for he had hardened the
hearts of the Lamanites and blinded
their minds, and stirred them up to
anger, insomuch that he had gath-
ered together a numerous host to
go to battle against the Nephites.

4 For he was determined, because
of the greatness of the number of his
people, to “overpower the Nephites
and to bring them into bondage.

5 And thus he did appoint ¢chief
captains of the °Zoramites, they be-
ing the most acquainted with the
strength of the Nephites, and their
places of resort, and the weakest
parts of their cities; therefore he
appointed them to be chief captains
over his armies.

6 And it came to pass that they
took their camp, and moved forth
toward the land of Zarahemla in
the wilderness.

7 Now it came to pass that while
Amalickiah had thus been obtaining
power by fraud and deceit, Moroni, on
the other hand, had been “preparing

the minds of the people to be faith-
ful unto the Lord their God.

8 Yea, he had been strengthening
the armies of the Nephites, and
erecting small “forts, or places of
resort; throwing up banks of earth
round about to enclose his armies,
and also building ’walls of stone to
encircle them about, round about
their cities and the borders of their
lands; yea, all round about the land.

9 And in their weakest fortifica-
tions he did place the greater num-
ber of men; and thus he did fortify
and strengthen the land which was
possessed by the Nephites.

10 And thus he was preparing to
4support their liberty, their lands,
their wives, and their children, and
their peace, and that they might live
unto the Lord their God, and that
they might maintain that which was
called by their enemies the cause
of ’Christians.

11 And Moroni was a “strong and
a mighty man; he was a man of a
perfect "understanding; yea, a man
that did not delight in bloodshed; a
man whose soul did joy in the lib-
erty and the freedom of his coun-
try, and his brethren from bondage
and slavery;

12 Yea, aman whose heart did swell
with thanksgiving to his God, for the
many privileges and blessings which
he bestowed upon his people; a man
who did labor exceedingly for the
“welfare and safety of his people.

13 Yea, and he was a man who
was firm in the faith of Christ, and
he had “sworn with an oath to de-
fend his people, his rights, and his
country, and his religion, even to
the loss of his blood.

14 Now the Nephites were taught

 

ALMA 48:8-19

to defend themselves against their
enemies, even to the shedding of
blood if it were necessary; yea, and
they were also taught “never to give
an offense, yea, and never to raise
the sword except it were against an
enemy, except it were to preserve
their lives.

15 And this was their “faith, that by
so doing God would prosper them
in the land, or in other words, if they
were faithful in keeping the com-
mandments of God that he would
prosper them in the land; yea, warn
them to flee, or to prepare for war,
according to their danger;

16 And also, that God would make
it known unto them “whither they
should go to defend themselves
against their enemies, and by so
doing, the Lord would deliver them;
and this was the faith of Moroni,
and his heart did glory in it; *not
in the shedding of blood but in do-
ing good, in preserving his people,
yea, in keeping the commandments
of God, yea, and resisting iniquity.

17 Yea, verily, verily Lsay unto you,
if all men had been, and were, and
ever would be, like unto “Moroni,
behold, the very powers of hell
would have been shaken forever;
yea, the ’devil would never have
power over the hearts of the children
of men.

18 Behold, he was a man like unto
“Ammon, the son of Mosiah, yea,
and even the other sons of Mosiah,
yea, and also Alma and his sons, for
they were all men of God.

19 Now behold, Helaman and his
brethren were no less “serviceable
unto the people than was Moroni;
for they did preach the word of
God, and they did baptize unto

repentance all men whosoever
would hearken unto their words.

20 And thus they went forth, and
the people did “humble themselves
because of their "words, insomuch
that they were highly ‘favored of
the Lord, and thus they were free
from wars and contentions among
themselves, yea, even for the space
of four years.

21 But, as I have said, in the “latter
end of the nineteenth year, yea, not-
withstanding their peace amongst
themselves, they were compelled
reluctantly to contend with their
brethren, the Lamanites.

22 Yea, and in fine, their wars
never did cease for the space of
many years with the Lamanites,
notwithstanding their much re-
luctance.

23 Now, they were “sorry to take
up arms against the Lamanites, be-
cause they did not delight in the
shedding of blood; yea, and this
was not all—they were "sorry to
be the means of sending so many
of their brethren out of this world
into an eternal world, ‘unprepared
to meet their God.

24 Nevertheless, they could not
suffer to lay down their lives, that
their *wives and their children
should be "massacred by the bar-
barous ‘cruelty of those who were
once their brethren, yea, and had
4dissented from their church, and
had left them and had gone to de-
stroy them by joining the Lamanites.

25 Yea, they could not bear that
their brethren should rejoice over
the blood of the Nephites, so long
as there were any who should keep
the commandments of God, for the
promise of the Lord was, if they
should keep his commandments
they should “prosper in the land.

CHAPTER 49

The invading Lamanites are unable
to take the fortified cities of Ammoni-
hah and Noah—Amialickiah curses
God and swears to drink the blood of
Moroni—Helaman and his brethren
continue to strengthen the Church.
About 72 B.C.

AND now it came to pass in the elev-
enth month of the nineteenth year,
on the tenth day of the month, the
armies of the Lamanites were seen
approaching towards the land of
¢Ammonihah.

2 And behold, the city had been
rebuilt, and Moroni had stationed
an army by the borders of the city,
and they had “cast up dirt round
about to shield them from the ar-
rows and the ’stones of the Laman-
ites; for behold, they fought with
stones and with arrows.

3 Behold, I said that the city of
¢Ammonihah had been rebuilt. I say
unto you, yea, that it was in part
rebuilt; and because the Laman-
ites had destroyed it once because
of the iniquity of the people, they
supposed that it would again be-
come an easy prey for them.

4 But behold, how great was their
disappointment; for behold, the
Nephites had dug up a “ridge of
earth round about them, which was
so high that the Lamanites could
not cast their stones and their ar-
rows at them that they might take
effect, neither could they come upon
them save it was by their place of
bentrance,

5 Now at this time the chief *cap-
tains of the Lamanites were aston-
ished exceedingly, because of the
wisdom of the Nephites in prepar-
ing their places of security.

6 Now the leaders of the Lamanites

had supposed, because of the great-
ness of their numbers, yea, they
supposed that they should be privi-
leged to come upon them as they
had hitherto done; yea, and they had
also prepared themselves with
shields, and with “breastplates;
and they had also prepared them-
selves with garments of skins, yea,
very thick garments to cover their
nakedness.

7 And being thus prepared they
supposed that they should easily
overpower and “subject their breth-
ren to the yoke of bondage, or slay
and massacre them according to
their pleasure.

8 But behold, to their uttermost
astonishment, they were “prepared
for them, in a manner which never
had been known among the chil-
dren of Lehi. Now they were pre-
pared for the Lamanites, to battle
after the manner of the instructions
of Moroni.

9 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites, or the Amalickiahites,
were exceedingly astonished at
their manner of preparation for
war.

10 Now, if king Amalickiah had
come down out of the “land of Nephi,
at the head of his army, perhaps
he would have caused the Laman-
ites to have attacked the Nephites
at the city of Ammonihah; for be-
hold, he did care not for the blood
of his people.

11 But behold, Amalickiah did not
come down himself to battle. And
behold, his chief captains durst
not attack the Nephites at the city
of Ammonihah, for Moroni had
altered the management of affairs
among the Nephites, insomuch that
the Lamanites were disappointed
in their places of retreat and they
could not come upon them.

12 Therefore they retreated into
the wilderness, and took their camp

 

ALMA 49:7-18

and marched towards the land of
“Noah, supposing that to be the
next best place for them to come
against the Nephites.

13 For they knew not that Moroni
had fortified, or had built “forts
of security, for every city in all the
land round about; therefore, they
marched forward to the land of
Noah with a firm determination;
yea, their chief captains came for-
ward and took an "oath that they
would destroy the people of that
city.

14 But behold, to their astonish-
ment, the city of Noah, which had
hitherto been a weak place, had
now, by the means of Moroni, be-
come strong, yea, even to exceed the
strength of the city Ammonihah.

15 And now, behold, this was wis-
dom in Moroni; for he had supposed
that they would be frightened at
the city Ammonihah; and as the
city of Noah had hitherto been the
weakest part of the land, therefore
they would march thither to bat-
tle; and thus it was according to
his desires.

16 And behold, Moroni had ap-
pointed Lehi to be chief captain
over the men of that city; and it was
that “same Lehi who fought with
the Lamanites in the valley on the
east of the river Sidon.

17 And now behold it came to
pass, that when the Lamanites had
found that Lehi commanded the
city they were again disappointed,
for they feared Lehi exceedingly;
nevertheless their chief captains
had “sworn with an oath to attack
the city; therefore, they brought up
their armies.

18 Now behold, the Lamanites
could not get into their forts of
security by any other way save by
the entrance, because of the high-
ness of the bank which had been
thrown up, and the depth of the

ditch which had been dug round
about, save it were by the entrance.

19 And thus were the Nephites pre-
pared to destroy all such as should
attempt to climb up to enter the fort
by any other way, by casting over
stones and arrows at them.

20 Thus they were prepared, yea,
a body of their strongest men, with
their swords and their slings, to
smite down all who should attempt
to come into their place of secu-
rity by the place of “entrance; and
thus were they prepared to defend
themselves against the Lamanites.

21 And it came to pass that the
captains of the Lamanites brought
up their armies before the place
of entrance, and began to contend
with the Nephites, to get into their
place of security; but behold, they
were driven back from time to time,
insomuch that they were slain with
an immense slaughter.

22 Now when they found that
they could not obtain power over
the Nephites by the pass, they be-
gan to dig down their banks of
earth that they might obtain a pass
to their armies, that they might
have an equal chance to fight; but
behold, in these attempts they were
swept off by the stones and arrows
which were thrown at them; and
instead of filling up their ditches
by pulling down the banks of earth,
they were filled up in a measure
with their dead and wounded
bodies.

23 Thus the Nephites had all power
over their enemies; and thus the La-
manites did attempt to destroy the
Nephites until their “chief captains
were all slain; yea, and more than
a thousand of the Lamanites were
slain; while, on the other hand,
there was not a single soul of the
Nephites which was slain.

24 There were about fifty who
were wounded, who had been ex-

 

332

posed to the arrows of the Lamanites
through the pass, but they were
shielded by their “shields, and their
breastplates, and their head-plates,
insomuch that their wounds were
upon their legs, many of which were
very severe.

25 And it came to pass, that when
the Lamanites saw that their chief
captains were all slain they fled
into the wilderness. And it came to
pass that they returned to the land
of Nephi, to inform their king,
Amalickiah, who was a“*Nephite by
birth, concerning their great loss.

26 And it came to pass that he was
exceedingly angry with his people,
because he had not obtained his
desire over the Nephites; he had
not subjected them to the yoke of
bondage.

27 Yea, he was exceedingly wroth,
and he did “curse God, and also Mo-
roni, swearing with an *oath that
he would drink his blood; and this
because Moroni had kept the com-
mandments of God in preparing
for the safety of his people.

28 And it came to pass, that on the
other hand, the people of Nephi did
*thank the Lord their God, because
of his matchless power in deliver-
ing them from the hands of their
enemies.

29 And thus ended the nineteenth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi.

30 Yea, and there was continual
peace among them, and exceedingly
great prosperity in the church be-
cause of their heed and diligence
which they gave unto the word of
God, which was declared unto them
by Helaman, and Shiblon, and Cori-
anton, and Ammon and his breth-
ren, yea, and by all those who had
been ordained by the “holy order
of God, being baptized unto re-
pentance, and sent forth to preach
among the people.

CHAPTER 50

Moroni fortifies the lands of the Neph-
ites—They build many new cities—Wars
and destructions befell the Nephites in
the days of their wickedness and abomi-
nations—Morianton and his dissenters
are defeated by Teancum—Nephihah
dies, and his son Pahoran fills the judg-
ment seat. About 72-67 B.C.

AND now it came to pass that Moroni
did not stop making preparations for
war, or to defend his people against
the Lamanites; for he caused that
his armies should commence in the
commencement of the twentieth
year of the reign of the judges, that
they should commence in digging
up “heaps of earth round about
all the cities, throughout all the
land which was possessed by the
Nephites.

2 And upon the top of these ridges
of earth he caused that there should
be “timbers, yea, works of timbers
built up to the height of a man,
round about the cities.

3 And he caused that upon those
works of timbers there should be
a frame of pickets built upon the
timbers round about; and they were
strong and high.

4 And he caused towers to be
erected that overlooked those works
of pickets, and he caused places of se-
curity to be built upon those “towers,
that the stones and the arrows of
the Lamanites could not hurt them.

5 And they were prepared that
they could cast stones from the top
thereof, according to their pleasure
and their strength, and slay him
who should attempt to approach
near the walls of the city.

6 Thus Moroni did prepare strong-
holds against the coming of their
enemies, round about every city in
all the land.

7 And it came to pass that Moroni
caused that his armies should go

 

ALMA 50:1-13

forth into the east wilderness; yea,
and they went forth and drove all
the Lamanites who were in the east
wilderness into their own lands,
which were “south of the land of
Zarahemla.

8 And the land of *Nephi did run
in a straight course from the east
sea to the west.

9 And it came to pass that when
Moroni had driven all the Laman-
ites out of the east wilderness,
which was north of the lands of
their own possessions, he caused
that the inhabitants who were in
the land of Zarahemla and in the
land round about should go forth
into the east wilderness, even to the
borders by the seashore, and possess
the land.

10 And he also placed armies on
the south, in the borders of their
possessions, and caused them to
erect “fortifications that they might
secure their armies and their people
from the hands of their enemies.

11 And thus he cut off all the
strongholds of the Lamanites in
the east wilderness, yea, and also
on the west, fortifying the line
between the Nephites and the La-
manites, between the land of Zara-
hemla and the land of Nephi, from
the west sea, running by the head
of the “river Sidon—the Nephites
possessing all the land "northward,
yea, even all the land which was
northward of the land Bountiful,
according to their pleasure.

12 Thus Moroni, with his armies,
which did increase daily because of
the assurance of protection which
his works did bring forth unto them,
did seek to cut off the strength and
the power of the Lamanites from off
the lands of their possessions, that
they should have no power upon
the lands of their possession.

13 And it came to pass that the
Nephites began the foundation ofa

city, and they called the name of
the city *Moroni; and it was by the
east sea; and it was on the south by
the line of the possessions of the
Lamanites.

14 And they also began a foun-
dation for a city between the city
of Moroni and the city of Aaron,
joining the borders of Aaron and
Moroni; and they called the name
of the city, or the land, *Nephihah.

15 And they also began in that
same year to build many cities on
the north, one in a particular man-
ner which they called “Lehi, which
was in the north by the borders of
the seashore.

16 And thus ended the twentieth
year.

17 And in these prosperous circum-
stances were the people of Nephi in
the commencement of the twenty
and first year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi.

18 And they did prosper “exceed-
ingly, and they became exceedingly
rich; yea, and they did multiply and
wax strong in the land.

19 And thus we see how metci-
ful and just are all the dealings of
the Lord, to the fulfilling of all his
words unto the children of men; yea,
we can behold that his words are
verified, even at this time, which
he spake unto Lehi, saying:

20 Blessed art thou and thy chil-
dren; and they shall be blessed,
inasmuch as they shall keep my
“commandments they shall pros-
per in the land. But remember, in-
asmuch as they will not keep my
commandments they shall be "cut
off from the presence of the Lord.

21 And we see that these prom-
ises have been verified to the peo-
ple of Nephi; for it has been their
quarrelings and their contentions,
yea, their murderings, and their

 

334

plunderings, their idolatry, their
whoredoms, and their abomina-
tions, which were among them-
selves, which “brought upon them
their wars and their destructions.

22 And those who were faithful
in keeping the commandments of
the Lord were delivered at all times,
whilst thousands of their wicked
brethren have been consigned to
bondage, or to perish by the sword,
or to dwindle in unbelief, and min-
gle with the Lamanites.

23 But behold there never was a
*happier time among the people of
Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than
in the days of Moroni, yea, even at
this time, in the twenty and first
year of the reign of the judges.

24 And it came to pass that the
twenty and second year of the reign
of the judges also ended in peace;
yea, and also the twenty and third
year.

25 And it came to pass that in
the commencement of the twenty
and fourth year of the reign of the
judges, there would also have been
peace among the people of Nephi
had it not been for a “contention
which took place among them con-
cerning the land of 'Lehi, and the
land of ‘Morianton, which joined
upon the borders of Lehi; both of
which were on the borders by the
seashore.

26 For behold, the people who
possessed the land of Morianton
did claim a part of the land of Lehi;
therefore there began to be a warm
“contention between them, inso-
much that the people of Morianton
took up arms against their breth-
ren, and they were determined by
the sword to slay them.

27 But behold, the people who pos-
sessed the land of Lehi fled to the
camp of Moroni, and appealed unto

him for assistance; for behold they
were not in the wrong.

28 And it came to pass that when
the people of Morianton, who were
led by a man whose name was Mori-
anton, found that the people of Lehi
had fled to the camp of Moroni,
they were exceedingly fearful lest
the army of Moroni should come
upon them and destroy them.

29 Therefore, Morianton put it into
their hearts that they should flee
to the land which was northward,
which was covered with “large bod-
ies of water, and take possession of
the land which was ’northward.

30 And behold, they would have
carried this plan into effect, (which
would have been a cause to have
been lamented) but behold, Mori-
anton being a man of much passion,
therefore he was angry with one of
his maid servants, and he fell upon
her and beat her much.

31 And it came to pass that she
fled, and came over to the camp of
Moroni, and told Moroni all things
concerning the matter, and also
concerning their intentions to flee
into the land northward.

32 Now behold, the people who
were in the land Bountiful, or rather
Moroni, feared that they would
hearken to the words of Morian-
ton and unite with his people, and
thus he would obtain possession
of those parts of the land, which
would lay a foundation for serious
consequences among the people of
Nephi, yea, which “consequences
would lead to the overthrow of their
“liberty.

33 Therefore Moroni sent an army,
with their camp, to head the people
of Morianton, to stop their flight
into the land northward.

34 And it came to pass that they
did not “head them until they had

 

ALMA 50:28-39

come to the borders of the land
Desolation; and there they did
head them, by the narrow pass
which led by the sea into the land
northward, yea, by the sea, on the
west and on the east.

35 And it came to pass that the
army which was sent by Moroni,
which was led by a man whose
name was Teancum, did meet the
people of Morianton; and so stub-
born were the people of Morianton,
(being inspired by his wickedness
and his “flattering words) that a
battle commenced between them,
in the which Teancum did ’slay
Morianton and defeat his army, and
took them prisoners, and returned
to the camp of Moroni. And thus
ended the twenty and fourth year
of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

36 And thus were the people of
Morianton brought back. And upon
their ¢covenanting to keep the peace
they were restored to the land of
Morianton, and a union took place
between them and the people of
Lehi; and they were also restored
to their lands.

37 And it came to pass that in the
same year that the people of Nephi
had peace restored unto them, that
Nephihah, the “second chief judge,
died, having filled the judgment-
seat with 'perfect uprightness be-
fore God.

38 Nevertheless, he had refused
Alma to take possession of those
“records and those things which
were esteemed by Alma and his
fathers to be most sacred; therefore
Alma had conferred ’them upon his
son, Helaman.

39 Behold, it came to pass that the
son of Nephihah was appointed to
fill the judgment-seat, in the stead
of his father; yea, he was appointed

chief judge and “governor over the
people, with an "oath and sacred or-
dinance to judge righteously, and to
keep the peace and the ‘freedom of
the people, and to grant unto them
their sacred privileges to worship
the Lord their God, yea, to support
and maintain the cause of God all
his days, and to bring the wicked
to justice according to their crime.

40 Now behold, his name was “Pa-
horan. And Pahoran did fill the seat
of his father, and did commence
his reign in the end of the twenty
and fourth year, over the people
of Nephi.

CHAPTER 51

The king-men seek to change the law
and set up a king—Pahoran and the
freemen are supported by the voice of
the people—Moroni compels the king-
men to defend their country or be put
to death—Amalickiah and the Laman-
ites capture many fortified cities—Te-
ancum repels the Lamanite invasion
and slays Amalickiah in his tent. About
67-66 B.C.

AND now it came to pass in the
commencement of the twenty and
fifth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi, they hav-
ing established peace between the
people of Lehi and the people of
Morianton concerning their lands,
and having commenced the twenty
and fifth year in “peace;

2 Nevertheless, they did not long
maintain an entire peace in the land,
for there began to be a contention
among the people concerning the
chief judge Pahoran; for behold,
there were a part of the people who
desired that a few particular points
of the “law should be altered.

3 But behold, Pahoran would not
alter nor suffer the law to be altered;

 

336

therefore, he did not hearken to
those who had sent in their voices
with their petitions concerning the
altering of the law.

4 Therefore, those who were de-
sirous that the law should be al-
tered were angry with him, and
desired that he should no longer be
chief judge over the land; therefore
there arose a warm “dispute con-
cerning the matter, but not unto
bloodshed.

5 And it came to pass that those
who were desirous that Pahoran
should be dethroned from the
judgment-seat were called “king-
men, for they were desirous that the
law should be altered in a manner to
overthrow the free government and
to establish a "king over the land.

6 And those who were desirous
that Pahoran should remain chief
judge over the land took upon them
the name of “freemen; and thus was
the "division among them, for the
freemen had sworn or ‘covenanted
to maintain their rights and the
privileges of their religion bya free
government.

7 And it came to pass that this
matter of their contention was set-
tled by the “voice of the people.
And it came to pass that the voice
of the people came in favor of the
freemen, and Pahoran retained
the judgment-seat, which caused
much rejoicing among the breth-
ren of Pahoran and also many of
the people of liberty, who also put
the king-men to silence, that they
durst not oppose but were obliged
to maintain the cause of freedom.

8 Now those who were in favor
of kings were those of “high birth,
and they sought to be kings; and
they were supported by those who
sought power and authority over
the people.

9 But behold, this was a critical
time for such contentions to be
among the people of Nephi; for be-
hold, Amalickiah had again “stirred
up the hearts of the people of the
Lamanites against the people of
the Nephites, and he was gathering
together soldiers from all parts of
his land, and arming them, and pre-
paring for war with all diligence; for
he had ’sworn to drink the blood
of Moroni.

10 But behold, we shall see that
his promise which he made was
“rash; nevertheless, he did prepare
himself and his armies to come to
battle against the Nephites.

11 Now his armies were not so
great as they had hitherto been, be-
cause of the many thousands who
had been ¢slain by the hand of the
Nephites; but notwithstanding their
great loss, Amalickiah had gathered
together a wonderfully great army,
insomuch that he feared not to come
down to the land of Zarahemla.

12 Yea, even Amalickiah did him-
self come down, at the head of the
Lamanites. And it was in the twenty
and fifth year of the reign of the
judges; and it was at the same time
that they had begun to settle the
affairs of their contentions con-
cerning the chief judge, Pahoran.

13 And it came to pass that when
the men who were called king-
men had heard that the Laman-
ites were coming down to battle
against them, they were glad in their
hearts; and they refused to take up
arms, for they were so wroth with
the chief judge, and also with the
“people of "liberty, that they would
not take up arms to defend their
country.

14 And it came to pass that when
Moroni saw this, and also saw that
the Lamanites were coming into the
borders of the land, he was exceed-
ingly wroth because of the “stub-

 

ALMA 51:9-20

bornness of those people whom he
had labored with so much diligence
to preserve; yea, he was exceedingly
wroth; his soul was filled with an-
ger against them.

15 And it came to pass that he sent
a petition, with the voice of the peo-
ple, unto the governor of the land,
desiring that he should read it, and
give him (Moroni) power to compel
those dissenters to defend their
country or to put them to death.

16 For it was his first care to put
an end to such contentions and
dissensions among the people; for
behold, this had been hitherto a
cause of all their destruction. And
it came to pass that it was granted
according to the voice of the people.

17 And it came to pass that Moroni
commanded that his army should
go against those king-men, to pull
down their pride and their nobil-
ity and level them with the earth,
or they should take up arms and
support the cause of liberty.

18 And it came to pass that the
armies did march forth against
them; and they did pull down their
pride and their nobility, insomuch
that as they did lift their weapons
of war to fight against the men of
Moroni they were hewn down and
leveled to the earth.

19 And it came to pass that there
were four thousand of those “dis-
senters who were hewn down by the
sword; and those of their leaders
who were not slain in battle were
taken and ’cast into prison, for
there was no time for their trials at
this period.

20 And the remainder of those
dissenters, rather than be smitten
down to the earth by the sword,
yielded to the standard of liberty,
and were compelled to hoist the
“title of liberty upon their towers,
and in their cities, and to take up
arms in defence of their country.

21 And thus Moroni put an end to
those king-men, that there were not
any known by the appellation of
king-men; and thus he put an end
to the stubbornness and the pride
of those people who professed the
blood of nobility; but they were
brought down to humble them-
selves like unto their brethren, and
to fight ¢valiantly for their freedom
from bondage.

22 Behold, it came to pass that
while Moroni was thus breaking
down the wars and contentions
among his own people, and subject-
ing them to peace and civilization,
and making regulations to prepare
for war against the Lamanites, be-
hold, the Lamanites had come into
the “land of Moroni, which was in
the borders by the seashore.

23 And it came to pass that the
Nephites were not sufficiently
strong in the city of Moroni; there-
fore Amalickiah did drive them,
slaying many. And it came to pass
that Amalickiah took possession of
the city, yea, possession of all their
fortifications.

24 And those who fled out of the
“city of Moroni came to the city of
Nephihah; and also the people of
the city of Lehi gathered themselves
together, and made preparations
and were ready to receive the La-
manites to battle.

25 But it came to pass that Amalick-
iah would not suffer the Lamanites
to go against the city of Nephihah
to battle, but kept them down by
the seashore, leaving men in every
city to maintain and defend it.

26 And thus he went on, taking
possession of “many cities, the city
of "Nephihah, and the city of “Lehi,
and the city of “Morianton, and
the city of Omner, and the city of
°Gid, and the city of 'Mulek, all of

 

338

which were on the east borders by
the seashore.

27 And thus had the Lamanites
obtained, by the cunning of Amal-
ickiah, so many cities, by their
numberless hosts, all of which were
strongly fortified after the manner
of the “fortifications of Moroni; all
of which afforded strongholds for
the Lamanites.

28 And it came to pass that they
marched to the “borders of the land
Bountiful, driving the Nephites be-
fore them and slaying many.

29 But it came to pass that they
were met by Teancum, who had
“slain Morianton and had "headed
his people in his flight.

30 And it came to pass that he
headed Amalickiah also, as he was
marching forth with his numerous
army that he might take possession
of the land Bountiful, and also the
land “northward.

31 But behold he met with a dis-
appointment by being repulsed
by Teancum and his men, for they
were great warriors; for every man
of Teancum did exceed the La-
manites in their strength and in
their skill of war, insomuch that
they did gain advantage over the
Lamanites.

32 And it came to pass that they
did harass them, insomuch that
they did slay them even until it was
dark. And it came to pass that Te-
ancum and his men did pitch their
tents in the borders of the land
Bountiful; and Amalickiah did
pitch his tents in the borders on
the beach by the seashore, and after
this manner were they driven.

33 And it came to pass that when
the night had come, Teancum and
his servant stole forth and went out
by night, and went into the camp
of Amalickiah; and behold, sleep

had overpowered them because
of their much fatigue, which was
caused by the labors and heat of
the day.

34 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum stole privily into the tent of
the king, and “put a javelin to his
heart; and he did cause the ’death
of the king immediately that he did
not awake his servants.

35 And he returned again privily
to his own camp, and behold, his
men were asleep, and he awoke
them and told them all the things
that he had done.

36 And he caused that his armies
should stand in “readiness, lest
the Lamanites had awakened and
should come upon them.

37 And thus endeth the twenty and
fifth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi; and thus
endeth the days of Amalickiah.

CHAPTER 52

Ammoron succeeds Amalickiah as king
of the Lamanites—Moroni, Teancum,
and Lehi lead the Nephites in a victo-
rious war against the Lamanites—The
city of Mulek is retaken, and Jacob the
Zoramite is slain. About 66—64 B.C.

AND now, it came to pass in the
twenty and sixth year of the reign of
the judges over the people of Nephi,
behold, when the Lamanites awoke
on the first morning of the first
month, behold, they found Amal-
ickiah was dead in his own tent;
and they also saw that Teancum
was “ready to give them battle on
that day.

2 And now, when the Lamanites
saw this they were affrighted; and
they abandoned their design in
marching into the land northward,
and retreated with all their army
into the city of *Mulek, and sought
protection in their fortifications.

 

ALMA 51:34-52:9

3 And it came to pass that the
“brother of Amalickiah was ap-
pointed king over the people; and
his name was "Ammoron; thus king
Ammoron, the brother of king Amal-
ickiah, was appointed to reign in
his stead.

4 And it came to pass that he did
command that his people should
maintain those cities, which they
had taken by the shedding of blood;
for they had not taken any cities
save they had lost much blood.

5 And now, Teancum saw that
the Lamanites were determined
to maintain those cities which
they had taken, and those parts of
the land which they had obtained
possession of; and also seeing the
enormity of their number, Teancum
thought it was not expedient that
he should attempt to attack them in
their forts.

6 But he Kept his men round about,
as if making preparations for war;
yea, and truly he was preparing to
defend himself against them, by
“casting up walls round about and
preparing places of resort.

7 And it came to pass that he kept
thus preparing for war until Moroni
had sent a large number of men to
strengthen his army.

8 And Moroni also sent orders unto
him that he should retain all the
prisoners who fell into his hands; for
as the Lamanites had taken many
prisoners, that he should retain all
the prisoners of the Lamanites as
a “ransom for those whom the La-
manites had taken.

9 And he also sent orders unto
him that he should fortify the land
“Bountiful, and secure the "narrow
pass which led into the land ‘north-
ward, lest the Lamanites should
obtain that point and should have
power to harass them on every
side.

10 And Moroni also sent unto him,
desiring him that he would be @faith-
ful in maintaining that quarter of
the land, and that he would seek
every opportunity to scourge the
Lamanites in that quarter, as much
as was in his power, that perhaps he
might take again by stratagem or
some other way those cities which
had been taken out of their hands;
and that he also would fortify and
strengthen the cities round about,
which had not fallen into the hands
of the Lamanites.

11 And he also said unto him, I
would come unto you, but behold,
the Lamanites are upon us in the
borders of the land by the west
sea; and behold, I go against them,
therefore I cannot come unto you.

12 Now, the king (Ammoron) had
“departed out of the land of Zara-
hemla, and had made known unto
the queen concerning the death of
his brother, and had gathered to-
gether a large number of men, and
had marched forth against the Neph-
ites on the borders by the west sea.

13 And thus he was endeavoring
to harass the Nephites, and to draw
away a part of their forces to that
part of the land, while he had com-
manded those whom he had left
to possess the cities which he had
taken, that they should also harass
the Nephites on the borders by the
east sea, and should take possession
of their lands as much as it was in
their power, according to the power
of their armies.

14 And thus were the Nephites in
those dangerous circumstances in
the ending of the twenty and sixth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi.

15 But behold, it came to pass in
the twenty and seventh year of the
reign of the judges, that Teancum,
by the command of Moroni—who
had established armies to protect
the south and the west borders of
the land, and had begun his march

 

340

towards the land Bountiful, that
he might assist Teancum with his
men in retaking the cities which
they had lost—

16 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum had received orders to make
an attack upon the city of Mulek,
and retake it if it were possible.

17 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum made preparations to make an
attack upon the city of Mulek, and
march forth with his army against
the Lamanites; but he saw that it was
impossible that he could overpower
them while they were in their for-
tifications; therefore he abandoned
his designs and returned again to
the city Bountiful, to wait for the
coming of Moroni, that he might
receive strength to his army.

18 And it came to pass that Mo-
roni did arrive with his army at
the land of Bountiful, in the latter
end of the twenty and seventh year
of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

19 And in the commencement of
the twenty and eighth year, Mo-
roni and Teancum and many of the
chief “captains held a council of
war—what they should do to cause
the Lamanites to come out against
them to battle; or that they might
by some means flatter them out of
their strongholds, that they might
gain advantage over them and take
again the city of Mulek.

20 And it came to pass they sent
embassies to the army of the La-
manites, which protected the city
of Mulek, to their leader, whose
name was Jacob, desiring him that
he would come out with his armies
to meet them upon the plains be-
tween the two cities. But behold,
Jacob, who was a *Zoramite, would
not come out with his army to meet
them upon the plains.

21 And it came to pass that Moroni,
having no hopes of meeting them
upon fair grounds, therefore, he re-
solved upon a plan that he might

“decoy the Lamanites out of their
strongholds.

22 Therefore he caused that Te-
ancum should take a small num-
ber of men and march down near
the seashore; and Moroni and his
army, by night, marched in the
wilderness, on the west of the city
*Mulek; and thus, on the morrow,
when the guards of the Lamanites
had discovered Teancum, they ran
and told it unto Jacob, their leader.

23 And it came to pass that the
armies of the Lamanites did march
forth against Teancum, supposing
by their numbers to overpower Te-
ancum because of the smallness of
his numbers. And as Teancum saw
the armies of the Lamanites coming
out against him he began to retreat
down by the seashore, northward.

24 And it came to pass that when
the Lamanites saw that he began
to flee, they took courage and pur-
sued them with vigor. And while
Teancum was thus leading away
the Lamanites who were pursu-
ing them in vain, behold, Moroni
commanded that a part of his army
who were with him should march
forth into the city, and take pos-
session of it.

25 And thus they did, and slew
all those who had been left to pro-
tect the city, yea, all those who
would not “yield up their weapons
of war.

26 And thus Moroni had obtained
possession of the city Mulek witha
part of his army, while he marched
with the remainder to meet the La-
manites when they should return
from the pursuit of Teancum.

27 And it came to pass that the La-
manites did pursue Teancum until
they came near the city Bountiful,
and then they were met by Lehi
and a small army, which had been
left to protect the city Bountiful.

28 And now behold, when the
chief captains of the Lamanites had
beheld Lehi with his army coming

 

ALMA 52:22-37

against them, they fled in much con-
fusion, lest perhaps they should not
obtain the city Mulek before Lehi
should overtake them; for they were
wearied because of their march, and
the men of Lehi were fresh.

29 Now the Lamanites did not
know that Moroni had been in their
rear with his army; and all they
feared was Lehi and his men.

30 Now Lehi was not desirous to
overtake them till they should meet
Moroni and his army.

31 And it came to pass that before
the Lamanites had retreated far they
were surrounded by the Nephites,
by the men of Moroni on one hand,
and the men of Lehi on the other,
all of whom were fresh and full of
strength; but the Lamanites were
wearied because of their long march.

32 And Moroni commanded his
men that they should fall upon
them until they had given up their
weapons of wart.

33 And it came to pass that Jacob,
being their leader, being also a
*Zoramite, and having an uncon-
querable spirit, he led the Laman-
ites forth to battle with exceeding
fury against Moroni.

34 Moroni being in their course of
march, therefore Jacob was deter-
mined to slay them and cut his way
through to the city of Mulek. But
behold, Moroni and his men were
more powerful; therefore they did
not give way before the Lamanites.

35 And it came to pass that they
fought on both hands with exceed-
ing fury; and there were many slain
on both sides; yea, and Moroni was
wounded and Jacob was killed.

36 And Lehi pressed upon their
rear with such fury with his strong
men, that the Lamanites in the rear
delivered up their weapons of war;
and the remainder of them, being
much confused, knew not whither
to go or to strike.

37 Now Moroni seeing their con-
fusion, he said unto them: If ye will

bring forth your weapons of war
and deliver them up, behold we
will forbear shedding your blood.

38 And it came to pass that when
the Lamanites had heard these
words, their chief captains, all those
who were not slain, came forth and
threw down their weapons of war
zat the feet of Moroni, and also com-
manded their men that they should
do the same.

39 But behold, there were many
that would not; and those who
would not deliver up their swords
were taken and bound, and their
weapons of war were taken from
them, and they were compelled to
march with their brethren forth
into the land Bountiful.

40 And now the number of prison-
ers who were taken exceeded more
than the number of those who had
been slain, yea, more than those
who had been slain on both sides,

CHAPTER 53

The Lamanite prisoners are used to
fortify the city Bountiful—Dissen-
sions among the Nephites give rise to
Lamanite victories—Helaman takes
command of the two thousand strip-
ling sons of the people of Ammon.
About 64-63 B.C.

AND it came to pass that they did
set guards over the prisoners of the
Lamanites, and did compel them to
go forth and bury their dead, yea,
and also the dead of the Nephites
who were slain; and Moroni placed
men over them to guard them
while they should perform their
labors.

2 And Moroni went to the city of
Mulek with Lehi, and took com-
mand of the city and gave it unto
Lehi. Now behold, this Lehi was a
man who had been with Moroni in
the more part of all his battles; and
he was a man “like unto Moroni,
and they rejoiced in each other’s

 

342

safety; yea, they were beloved by
each other, and also beloved by all
the people of Nephi.

3 And it came to pass that after
the Lamanites had finished burying
their dead and also the dead of the
Nephites, they were marched back
into the land Bountiful; and Tean-
cum, by the orders of Moroni, caused
that they should commence laboring
in “digging a ditch round about the
land, or the city, "Bountiful.

4 And he caused that they should
build a“breastwork of timbers upon
the inner bank of the ditch; and they
cast up dirt out of the ditch against
the breastwork of timbers; and thus
they did cause the Lamanites to
labor until they had encircled the
city of Bountiful round about with
a strong wall of timbers and earth,
to an exceeding height.

5 And this city became an exceed-
ing stronghold ever after; and in this
city they did guard the prisoners of
the Lamanites; yea, even within a
wall which they had caused them to
*build with their own hands. Now
Moroni was compelled to cause the
Lamanites to labor, because it was
easy to guard them while at their
labor; and he desired all his forces
when he should make an attack
upon the Lamanites.

6 And it came to pass that Moroni
had thus gained a victory over one
of the greatest of the armies of the
Lamanites, and had obtained pos-
session of the city of *Mulek, which
was one of the strongest holds of
the Lamanites in the land of Nephi;
and thus he had also built a strong-
hold to retain his prisoners.

7 And it came to pass that he did
no more attempt a battle with the
Lamanites in that year, but he did
employ his men in preparing for
war, yea, and in making fortifica-
tions to guard against the Lamanites,
yea, and also delivering their women
and their children from famine and

affliction, and providing food for
their armies.

8 And now it came to pass that
the armies of the Lamanites, on the
west sea, south, while in the absence
of Moroni on account of some in-
trigue amongst the Nephites, which
caused “dissensions amongst them,
had gained some ground over the
Nephites, yea, insomuch that they
had obtained possession of a num-
ber of their cities in that part of
the land.

9 And thus because of ‘iniquity
amongst themselves, yea, because
of dissensions and intrigue among
themselves they were placed in the
most dangerous circumstances.

10 And now behold, I have some-
what to say concerning the “people
of Ammon, who, in the beginning,
were Lamanites; but by Ammon
and his brethren, or rather by the
power and word of God, they had
been ’converted unto the Lord; and
they had been brought down into
the land of Zarahemla, and had
ever since been protected by the
Nephites.

11 And because of their oath they
had been kept from taking up arms
against their brethren; for they had
taken an oath that they “never would
shed blood more; and according
to their oath they would have per-
ished; yea, they would have suffered
themselves to have fallen into the
hands of their brethren, had it not
been for the pity and the exceeding
love which Ammon and his breth-
ren had had for them.

12 And for this cause they were
brought down into the land of
Zarahemla; and they ever had been
“protected by the Nephites.

13 But it came to pass that when
they saw the danger, and the many
“afflictions and tribulations which
the Nephites bore for them, they

 

ALMA 53:8-20

were moved with compassion and
were "desirous to take up arms in
the defence of their country.

14 But behold, as they were about
to take their weapons of war, they
were overpowered by the persua-
sions of Helaman and his brethren,
for they were about to “break the
’oath which they had made.

15 And Helaman feared lest by
so doing they should lose their
souls; therefore all those who had
entered into this covenant were
compelled to behold their brethren
wade through their afflictions, in
their dangerous circumstances at
this time.

16 But behold, it came to pass
they had many “sons, who had not
entered into a covenant that they
would not take their weapons of
war to defend themselves against
their enemies; therefore they did
assemble themselves together at this
time, as many as were able to take
up arms, and they called themselves
Nephites.

17 And they entered into a cov-
enant to fight for the liberty of the
Nephites, yea, to protect the land
unto the “laying down of their lives;
yea, even they covenanted that they
never would give up their ’liberty,
but they would fight in all cases to
protect the Nephites and themselves
from bondage.

18 Now behold, there were two
thousand of those young men, who
entered into this covenant and took
their weapons of war to defend
their country.

19 And now behold, as they never
had hitherto been a disadvantage
to the Nephites, they became now
at this period of time also a great
support; for they took their weap-
ons of war, and they would that
Helaman should be their leader.

20 And they were all young men,

and they were exceedingly valiant
for “courage, and also for strength
and activity; but behold, this was
not all—_they were men who were
true at all times in whatsoever thing
they were entrusted.

21 Yea, they were men of truth and
“soberness, for they had been taught
to keep the commandments of God
and to ’walk uprightly before him.

22 And now it came to pass that
Helaman did march at the head of
his “two thousand stripling soldiers,
to the support of the people in the
borders of the land on the south by
the west sea.

23 And thus ended the twenty
and eighth year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi.

CHAPTER 54

Ammoron and Moroni negotiate for the
exchange of prisoners—Moroni demands
that the Lamanites withdraw and cease
their murderous attacks—Ammoron
demands that the Nephites lay down
their arms and become subject to the
Lamanites. About 63 B.c.

AND now it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the twenty and ninth
year of the judges, that “Ammoron
sent unto Moroni desiring that he
would exchange prisoners.

2 And it came to pass that Moroni
felt to “rejoice exceedingly at this
request, for he desired the provi-
sions which were imparted for the
support of the Lamanite prisoners
for the support of his own peo-
ple; and he also desired his own
people for the strengthening of
his army.

3 Now the Lamanites had taken
many women and children, and
there was not a woman nor a child
among all the prisoners of Moroni,
or the prisoners whom Moroni had
taken; therefore Moroni resolved

 

344

upon a stratagem to obtain as many
prisoners of the Nephites from the
Lamanites as it were possible.

4 Therefore he wrote an epistle,
and sent it by the servant of Am-
moron, the same who had brought
an epistle to Moroni. Now these
are the words which he wrote unto
Ammoron, saying:

5 Behold, Ammoron, I have written
unto you somewhat concerning this
war which ye have waged against
my people, or rather which thy
*brother hath waged against them,
and which ye are still determined
to carry on after his death.

6 Behold, I would tell you some-
what concerning the “justice of
God, and the sword of his almighty
wrath, which doth hang over you
except ye repent and withdraw your
armies into your own lands, or the
land of your possessions, which is
the land of Nephi.

7 Yea, | would tell you these things
if ye were capable of hearkening
unto them; yea, I would tell you
concerning that awful “hell that
awaits to receive such ’murderers
as thou and thy brother have been,
except ye repent and withdraw
your murderous purposes, and
return with your armies to your
own lands.

8 But as ye have once rejected these
things, and have fought against the
people of the Lord, even so I may
expect you will do it again.

9 And now behold, we are prepared
to receive you; yea, and except you
withdraw your purposes, behold, ye
will pull down the “wrath of that
God whom you have rejected upon
you, even to your utter destruction.

10 But, as the Lord liveth, our
armies shall come upon you except
ye withdraw, and ye shall soon be
visited with “death, for we will re-
tain our cities and our lands; yea,

and we will maintain our religion
and the cause of our God.

11 But behold, it supposeth me
that I talk to you concerning these
things in vain; or it supposeth me
that thou art a“child of hell; there-
fore I will close my epistle by tell-
ing you that I will not exchange
prisoners, save it be on conditions
that ye will deliver up a man and
his wife and his children, for one
prisoner; if this be the case that ye
will do it, I will exchange.

12 And behold, if ye do not this,
I will come against you with my
armies; yea, even I will arm my
women and my children, and I will
come against you, and I will follow
you even into your own land, which
is the land of “our first inheritance;
yea, and it shall be blood for blood,
yea, life for life; and I will give you
battle even until you are destroyed
from off the face of the earth.

13 Behold, Iam in my anger, and
also my people; ye have sought to
“murder us, and we have only sought
to defend ourselves, But behold, if
ye seek to destroy us more we will
seek to destroy you; yea, and we
will seek our land, the land of our
first inheritance.

14 Now I close my epistle. I am
Moroni; lam a leader of the people
of the Nephites.

15 Now it came to pass that Am-
moron, when he had received this
epistle, was angry; and he wrote
another epistle unto Moroni, and
these are the words which he wrote,
saying:

16 lam Ammoron, the king of the
Lamanites; Iam the brother of Amal-
ickiah whom ye have “murdered.
Behold, I will avenge his blood upon
you, yea, and I will come upon you
with my armies for I fear not your
threatenings.

17 For behold, your fathers did
wrong their brethren, insomuch

 

ALMA 54:11-24

that they did rob them of their
“right to the "government when it
rightly belonged unto them.

18 And now behold, if ye will lay
down your arms, and subject your-
selves to be governed by those to
whom the government doth rightly
belong, then will I cause that my
people shall lay down their weap-
ons and shall be at war no more.

19 Behold, ye have breathed out
many threatenings against me and
my people; but behold, we fear not
your threatenings.

20 Nevertheless, I will grant to ex-
change prisoners according to your
request, gladly, that I may preserve
my food for my men of war; and
we will wage a war which shall be
eternal, either to the subjecting the
Nephites to our authority or to their
eternal extinction.

21 And as concerning that God
whom ye say we have rejected, be-
hold, we “know not such a being; nei-
ther do ye; but if it so be that there
is such a being, we know not but
that he hath made us as wellas you.

22 And if it so be that there is a
devil and a hell, behold will he not
send you there to dwell with my
brother whom ye have murdered,
whom ye have hinted that he hath
gone to such a place? But behold
these things matter not.

23 1 am Ammoron, and a de-
scendant of *Zoram, whom your
fathers pressed and brought out of
Jerusalem.

24 And behold now, I am a bold
Lamanite; behold, this war hath
been waged to avenge their wrongs,
and “to maintain and to obtain their
rights to the government; and I close
my epistle to Moroni.

ers—The Lamanite guards are enticed

to become drunk, and the Nephite pris-
oners are freed—The city of Gid is taken
without bloodshed. About 63-62 B.C.

Now it came to pass that when Mo-
roni had received this epistle he was
more angry, because he knew that
Ammoron had a perfect knowledge
of his *fraud; yea, he knew that Am-
moron Knew that it was not a just
cause that had caused him to wage
a war against the people of Nephi.

2 And he said: Behold, I will not
exchange prisoners with Ammoron
save he will withdraw his “purpose,
as I have stated in my epistle; for
I will not grant unto him that he
shall have any more power than
what he hath got.

3 Behold, I know the place where
the Lamanites do guard my people
whom they have taken prisoners;
and as Ammoron would not grant
unto me mine epistle, behold, I
will give unto him according to my
words; yea, I will seek death among
them until they shall sue for peace.

4 And now it came to pass that
when Moroni had said these words,
he caused that a search should be
made among his men, that perhaps
he might find a man who was a de-
scendant of Laman among them.

5 And it came to pass that they
found one, whose name was Laman;
and he was “one of the servants
of the king who was murdered by
Amalickiah.

6 Now Moroni caused that Laman
and a small number of his men
should go forth unto the guards
who were over the Nephites.

7 Now the Nephites were guarded
in the city of *Gid; therefore Moroni
appointed Laman and caused that
a small number of men should go
with him.

8 And when it was evening Laman
went to the guards who were over
the Nephites, and behold, they saw

 

346

him coming and they hailed him;
but he saith unto them: Fear not;
behold, I am a Lamanite. Behold,
we have escaped from the Neph-
ites, and they sleep; and behold
we have taken of their wine and
brought with us.

9 Now when the Lamanites heard
these words they received him with
joy; and they said unto him: Give
us of your wine, that we may drink;
we are glad that ye have thus taken
wine with you for we are weary.

10 But Laman said unto them:
Let us Keep of our wine till we go
against the Nephites to battle. But
this saying only made them more
desirous to drink of the wine;

11 For, said they: We are weary,
therefore let us take of the wine, and
by and by we shall receive wine for
our rations, which will strengthen
us to go against the Nephites.

12 And Laman said unto them: You
may do according to your desires.

13 And it came to pass that they
did take of the wine freely; and it
was pleasant to their taste, therefore
they took of it more freely; and it
was strong, having been prepared
in its “strength.

14 And it came to pass they did
drink and were merry, and by and
by they were all “drunken.

15 And now when Laman and his
men saw that they were all drunken,
and were in a “deep sleep, they re-
turned to Moroni and told him all
the things that had happened.

16 And now this was according to
the design of Moroni. And Moroni
had prepared his men with weap-
ons of war; and he went to the city
Gid, while the Lamanites were ina
deep sleep and drunken, and cast in
*weapons of war unto the prisoners,
insomuch that they were all armed;

17 Yea, even to their women, and
all those of their children, as many
as were able to use a Weapon of war,

when Moroni had armed all those
prisoners; and all those things were
done in a profound silence.

18 But had they awakened the La-
manites, behold they were drunken
and the Nephites could have slain
them.

19 But behold, this was not the
desire of Moroni; he did not “delight
in murder or bloodshed, but he de-
lighted in the saving of his people
from destruction; and for this cause
he might not bring upon him in-
justice, he would not fall upon the
Lamanites and destroy them in their
drunkenness.

20 But he had obtained his desires;
for he had armed those prisoners of
the Nephites who were within the
wall of the city, and had given them
power to gain possession of those
parts which were within the walls.

21 And then he caused the men
who were with him to withdraw a
pace from them, and surround the
armies of the Lamanites.

22 Now behold this was done in
the night-time, so that when the
Lamanites awoke in the morning
they beheld that they were sur-
rounded by the Nephites without,
and that their prisoners were armed
within.

23 And thus they saw that the
Nephites had power over them; and
in these circumstances they found
that it was not expedient that they
should fight with the Nephites;
therefore their chief “captains de-
manded their weapons of war, and
they brought them forth and °cast
them at the feet of the Nephites,
pleading for mercy.

24 Now behold, this was the desire
of Moroni. He took them prisoners
of war, and took possession of the
city, and caused that all the prison-
ers should be liberated, who were
Nephites; and they did join the
army of Moroni, and were a great
strength to his army.

 

ALMA 55:18-33

25 And it came to pass that he did
cause the Lamanites, whom he had
taken prisoners, that they should
commence a “labor in strengthen-
ing the fortifications round about
the city Gid.

26 And it came to pass that when
he had fortified the city Gid, ac-
cording to his desires, he caused
that his prisoners should be taken
to the city Bountiful; and he also
guarded that city with an exceed-
ingly strong force.

27 And it came to pass that they
did, notwithstanding all the in-
trigues of the Lamanites, keep and
protect all the prisoners whom they
had taken, and also maintain all the
ground and the advantage which
they had retaken.

28 And it came to pass that the
Nephites began again to be victo-
rious, and to reclaim their rights
and their privileges.

29 Many times did the Lamanites
attempt to encircle them about by
night, but in these attempts they
did lose many prisoners.

30 And many times did they at-
tempt to administer of their wine
to the Nephites, that they might
destroy them with poison or with
drunkenness.

31 But behold, the Nephites were
not slow to “remember the Lord
their God in this their time of af-
fliction. They could not be taken
in their snares; yea, they would not
partake of their wine, save they had
first given to some of the Lamanite
prisoners.

32 And they were thus cautious
that no poison should be admin-
istered among them; for if their
wine would poison a Lamanite it
would also poison a Nephite; and
thus they did try all their liquors.

33 And now it came to pass that it
was expedient for Moroni to make
preparations to attack the city “Mori-
anton; for behold, the Lamanites

had, by their labors, fortified the
city Morianton until it had become
an exceeding stronghold.

34 And they were continually
bringing new forces into that city,
and also new supplies of provisions.

35 And thus ended the twenty and
ninth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi.

CHAPTER 56

Helaman sends an epistle to Moroni,
recounting the state of the war with
the Lamanites—Antipus and Helaman
gain a great victory over the Laman-
ites—Helaman’s two thousand stripling
sons fight with miraculous power, and
none of them are slain. Verse 1, about
62 B.C.; verses 2-19, about 66 B.C.; and
verses 20-57, about 65-64 B.C.

AND now it came to pass in the
commencement of the thirtieth
year of the reign of the judges, on
the second day in the first month,
*Moroni received an ’epistle from
Helaman, stating the affairs of the
people in ‘that quarter of the land.

2 And these are the words which
he wrote, saying: My dearly beloved
brother, Moroni, as well in the Lord
as in the tribulations of our war-
fare; behold, my beloved brother,
I have somewhat to tell you con-
cerning our warfare in this part of
the land.

3 Behold, “two thousand of the sons
of those men whom Ammon brought
down out of the land of Nephi—now
ye have known that these were de-
scendants of Laman, who was the
eldest son of our father Lehi;

4 Now I need not rehearse unto
you concerning their traditions or
their unbelief, for thou knowest
concerning all these things—

5 Therefore it sufficeth me that
I tell you that two thousand of
these young men have taken their

 

348

weapons of war, and would that I
should be their leader; and we have
come forth to defend our country.

6 And now ye also know con-
cerning the “covenant which their
fathers made, that they would not
take up their weapons of war against
their brethren to shed blood.

7 But in the twenty and sixth year,
when they saw our afflictions and
our tribulations for them, they were
about to “break the covenant which
they had made and take up their
weapons of war in our defence.

8 But I would not suffer them that
they should break this ¢covenant
which they had made, supposing
that God would strengthen us, in-
somuch that we should not suffer
more because of the fulfilling the
’oath which they had taken.

9 But behold, here is one thing in
which we may have great joy. For
behold, in the twenty and sixth
year, I, Helaman, did march at the
head of these “two thousand young
men to the city of "Judea, to assist
Antipus, whom ye had appointed a
leader over the people of that part
of the land.

10 And I did join my two thou-
sand “sons, (for they are worthy to
be called sons) to the army of An-
tipus, in which strength Antipus
did rejoice exceedingly; for behold,
his army had been reduced by the
Lamanites because their forces had
slain a vast number of our men,
for which cause we have to mourn.

11 Nevertheless, we may console
ourselves in this point, that they
have died in the cause of their
country and of their God, yea, and
they are “happy.

12 And the Lamanites had also re-
tained many prisoners, all of whom
are chief “captains, for none other
have they spared alive. And we
suppose that they are now at this

time in the land of Nephi; it is so
if they are not slain.

13 And now these are the cities of
which the Lamanites have obtained
possession by the shedding of the
blood of so many of our valiant men:

14 The land of *Manti, or the city
of Manti, and the city of Zeezrom,
and the city of "Cumeni, and the
city of Antiparah.

15 And these are the cities which
they possessed when I arrived at
the city of Judea; and I found Anti-
pus and his men toiling with their
might to fortify the city.

16 Yea, and they were depressed
in body as well as in spirit, for they
had fought valiantly by day and
toiled by night to maintain their
cities; and thus they had suffered
great afflictions of every kind.

17 And now they were determined
to conquer in this place or die; there-
fore you may well suppose that this
little force which I brought with
me, yea, those “sons of mine, gave
them great hopes and much joy.

18 And now it came to pass that
when the Lamanites saw that Anti-
pus had received a greater strength
to his army, they were compelled
by the orders of Ammoron to not
come against the city of Judea, or
against us, to battle.

19 And thus were we favored of
the Lord; for had they come upon
us in this our weakness they might
have perhaps destroyed our little
army; but thus were we preserved.

20 They were commanded by
Ammoron to maintain those cities
which they had taken. And thus
ended the twenty and sixth year.
And in the commencement of the
twenty and seventh year we had
prepared our city and ourselves for
defence.

21 Now we were desirous that
the Lamanites should come upon
us; for we were not desirous to
make an attack upon them in their
strongholds.

22 And it came to pass that we kept

 

ALMA 56:13-30

spies out round about, to watch the
movements of the Lamanites, that
they might not pass us by night
nor by day to make an attack upon
our other cities which were on the
northward.

23 For we Knew in those cities
they were not sufficiently strong
to meet them; therefore we were
desirous, if they should pass by us,
to fall upon them in their rear, and
thus bring them up in the rear at
the same time they were met in the
front. We supposed that we could
overpower them; but behold, we
were disappointed in this our desire.

24 They durst not pass by us with
their whole army, neither durst
they with a part, lest they should
not be sufficiently strong and they
should fall.

25 Neither durst they march down
against the city of Zarahemla; nei-
ther durst they cross the head of
Sidon, over to the city of Nephihah.

26 And thus, with their forces,
they were determined to maintain
those cities which they had taken.

27 And now it came to pass in the
second month of this year, there was
brought unto us many provisions
from the fathers of those my two
thousand sons.

28 And also there were sent two
thousand men unto us from the
land of Zarahemla. And thus we
were prepared with ten thousand
men, and provisions for them,
and also for their wives and their
children.

29 And the Lamanites, thus seeing
our forces increase daily, and pro-
visions arrive for our support, they
began to be fearful, and began to
sally forth, if it were possible to put
an end to our receiving provisions
and strength.

30 Now when we saw that the
Lamanites began to grow uneasy
on this wise, we were desirous to
bring a stratagem into effect upon
them; therefore Antipus ordered
that I should march forth with my

 

14a Alma 43:22. |

b Alma 57:7 (7-34).

| 17a Alma 56:10.
ALMA 56:31-47

little sons to a neighboring city, “as
if we were carrying provisions toa
neighboring city.

31 And we were to march near the
city of Antiparah, as if we were go-
ing to the city beyond, in the bor-
ders by the seashore.

32 And it came to pass that we did
march forth, as if with our provi-
sions, to go to that city.

33 And it came to pass that Anti-
pus did march forth with a part of
his army, leaving the remainder to
maintain the city. But he did not
march forth until I had gone forth
with my little army, and came near
the city Antiparah.

34 And now, in the city Antiparah
were stationed the strongest army
of the Lamanites; yea, the most
numerous.

35 And it came to pass that when
they had been informed by their
spies, they came forth with their
army and marched against us.

36 And it came to pass that we did
flee before them, northward. And
thus we did lead away the most
powerful army of the Lamanites;

37 Yea, even to a considerable dis-
tance, insomuch that when they
saw the army of Antipus pursuing
them, with their might, they did
not turn to the right nor to the
left, but pursued their march ina
straight course after us; and, as we
suppose, it was their intent to slay
us before Antipus should overtake
them, and this that they might not
be surrounded by our people.

38 And now Antipus, beholding
our danger, did speed the march of
his army. But behold, it was night;
therefore they did not overtake
us, neither did Antipus overtake
them; therefore we did camp for
the night.

39 And it came to pass that before
the dawn of the morning, behold,
the Lamanites were pursuing us.
Now we were not sufficiently strong

 

350

to contend with them; yea, I would
not suffer that my little sons should
fall into their hands; therefore we
did continue our march, and we
took our march into the wilderness.

40 Now they durst not turn to the
right nor to the left lest they should
be surrounded; neither would I turn
to the right nor to the left lest they
should overtake me, and we could
not stand against them, but be slain,
and they would make their escape;
and thus we did flee all that day
into the wilderness, even until it
was dark.

41 And it came to pass that again,
when the light of the morning came
we saw the Lamanites upon us, and
we did flee before them.

42 But it came to pass that they
did not pursue us far before they
halted; and it was in the morning of
the third day of the seventh month.

43 And now, whether they were
overtaken by Antipus we knew not,
but I said unto my men: Behold, we
know not but they have halted for
the purpose that we should come
against them, that they might catch
us in their snare;

44 Therefore what say ye, my sons,
will ye go against them to battle?

45 And now I say unto you, my
beloved brother Moroni, that never
had I seen “so great ‘courage, nay,
not amongst all the Nephites.

46 For as I had ever called them
my sons (for they were all of them
very young) even so they said unto
me: Father, behold our God is with
us, and he will *not suffer that we
should fall; then let us go forth;
we would not slay our brethren if
they would let us alone; therefore
let us go, lest they should overpower
the army of Antipus.

47 Now they never had fought,
yet they did not fear death; and
they did think more upon the
“liberty of their fathers than they
did upon their lives; yea, they had

been taught by their “mothers, that
if they did not doubt, God would
deliver them.

48 And they rehearsed unto me
the words of their “mothers, say-
ing: We ’do not doubt our mothers
knew it.

49 And it came to pass that I did re-
turn with my two thousand against
these Lamanites who had pursued
us. And now behold, the armies of
Antipus had overtaken them, and
a terrible battle had commenced.

50 The army of Antipus being
weary, because of their long march
in so short a space of time, were
about to fall into the hands of the
Lamanites; and had I not returned
with my two thousand they would
have obtained their purpose.

51 For Antipus had fallen by the
sword, and many of his leaders, be-
cause of their weariness, which was
occasioned by the speed of their
march—therefore the men of Anti-
pus, being confused because of the
fall of their leaders, began to give
way before the Lamanites.

52 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites took courage, and began
to pursue them; and thus were the
Lamanites pursuing them with great
vigor when “Helaman came upon
their rear with his two thousand,
and began to slay them exceedingly,
insomuch that the whole army of
the Lamanites halted and turned
upon Helaman.

53 Now when the people of An-
tipus saw that the Lamanites had
turned them about, they gathered
together their men and came again
upon the rear of the Lamanites.

54 And now it came to pass
that we, the people of Nephi, the
people of Antipus, and I with my
two thousand, did surround the
Lamanites, and did slay them; yea,
insomuch that they were compelled
to deliver up their weapons of war

 

ALMA 56:48-57:2

and also themselves as prisoners
of war.

55 And now it came to pass that
when they had surrendered them-
selves up unto us, behold, I num-
bered those young men who had
fought with me, fearing lest there
were many of them slain.

56 But behold, to my great joy,
there had “not one soul of them
fallen to the earth; yea, and they
had fought as if with the ’strength
of God; yea, never were men known
to have fought with such miracu-
lous strength; and with such mighty
power did they fall upon the Laman-
ites, that they did frighten them;
and for this cause did the Lamanites
deliver themselves up as prisoners
of war.

57 And as we had no place for our
prisoners, that we could guard them
to keep them from the armies of the
Lamanites, therefore we sent them
to the land of Zarahemla, and a part
of those men who were not slain
of Antipus, with them; and the re-
mainder I took and joined them to
my stripling “Ammonites, and took
our march back to the city of Judea.

CHAPTER 57

tiparah and the surrender and later
the defense of Cumeni—His Ammon-
ite striplings fight valiantly; all are
wounded, but none are slain—Gid
reports the slaying and the escape of
the Lamanite prisoners. About 63 B.C.

AND now it came to pass that I re-
ceived an epistle from Ammoron,
the king, stating that if I would
deliver up those prisoners of war
whom we had taken that he would
deliver up the city of Antiparah
unto us.

2 But I sent an epistle unto the
king, that we were sure our forces
were sufficient to take the city of

Antiparah by our force; and by de-
livering up the prisoners for that
city we should suppose ourselves
unwise, and that we would only de-
liver up our prisoners on exchange.

3 And Ammoron refused mine
epistle, for he would not exchange
prisoners; therefore we began to
make preparations to go against
the city of Antiparah.

4 But the people of Antiparah did
leave the city, and fled to their other
cities, which they had possession of,
to fortify them; and thus the city
of Antiparah fell into our hands.

5 And thus ended the twenty
and eighth year of the reign of
the judges.

6 And it came to pass that in the
commencement of the twenty and
ninth year, we received a supply
of provisions, and also an addition
to our army, from the land of Zara-
hemla, and from the land round
about, to the number of six thou-
sand men, besides sixty of the “sons
of the Ammonites who had come to
join their brethren, my little band
of two thousand. And now behold,
we were strong, yea, and we had
also plenty of provisions brought
unto us.

7 And it came to pass that it was
our desire to wage a battle with the
army which was placed to protect
the city *Cumeni.

8 And now behold, I will show unto
you that we soon accomplished our
desire; yea, with our strong force, or
with a part of our strong force, we
did surround, by night, the city
Cumeni, a little before they were
to receive a supply of provisions.

9 And it came to pass that we did
camp round about the city for many
nights; but we did sleep upon our
swords, and keep guards, that the
Lamanites could not come upon us
by night and slay us, which they at-
tempted many times; but as many
times as they attempted this their
blood was spilt.

10 At length their provisions did

 

352

arrive, and they were about to enter
the city by night. And we, instead
of being Lamanites, were Nephites;
therefore, we did take them and
their provisions.

11 And notwithstanding the La-
manites being cut off from their
support after this manner, they were
still determined to maintain the
city; therefore it became expedient
that we should take those provisions
and send them to “Judea, and our
prisoners to the land of Zarahemla.

12 And it came to pass that not
many days had passed away before
the Lamanites began to lose all hopes
of succor; therefore they yielded up
the city unto our hands; and thus
we had accomplished our designs
in obtaining the city Cumeni.

13 But it came to pass that our
prisoners were so numerous that,
notwithstanding the enormity of
our numbers, we were obliged to
employ all our force to keep them,
or to put them to death.

14 For behold, they would break
out in great numbers, and would
fight with stones, and with clubs,
or whatsoever thing they could get
into their hands, insomuch that we
did slay upwards of two thousand
of them after they had surrendered
themselves prisoners of war.

15 Therefore it became expedient
for us, that we should put an end
to their lives, or guard them, sword
in hand, down to the land of Zara-
hemla; and also our provisions were
not any more than sufficient for
our own people, notwithstanding
that which we had taken from the
Lamanites.

16 And now, in those critical cir-
cumstances, it became a very seri-
ous matter to determine concerning
these prisoners of war; nevertheless,
we did resolve to send them down
to the land of Zarahemla; there-
fore we selected a part of our men,
and gave them charge over our
prisoners to go down to the land of
Zarahemla.

353

17 But it came to pass that on the
morrow they did return. And now
behold, we did not inquire of them
concerning the prisoners; for be-
hold, the Lamanites were upon us,
and they returned in season to save
us from falling into their hands.
For behold, Ammoron had sent to
their support a new supply of pro-
visions and also a numerous army
of men.

18 And it came to pass that those
men whom we sent with the pris-
oners did arrive in season to check
them, as they were about to over-
power us.

19 But behold, my little band of
two thousand and sixty fought most
desperately; yea, they were firm
before the Lamanites, and did 4ad-
minister death unto all those who
opposed them.

20 And as the remainder of our
army were about to give way be-
fore the Lamanites, behold, those
two thousand and sixty were firm
and undaunted.

21 Yea, and they did “obey and
observe to perform every word
of command with exactness; yea,
and even according to their faith it
was done unto them; and I did re-
member the words which they said
unto me that their "mothers had
taught them.

22 And now behold, it was these
my sons, and those men who had
been selected to convey the prison-
ers, to whom we owe this great vic-
tory; for it was they who did beat
the Lamanites; therefore they were
driven back to the city of Manti.

23 And we retained our city Cu-
meni, and were not all destroyed
by the sword; nevertheless, we had
suffered great loss.

24 And it came to pass that after
the Lamanites had fled, I imme-
diately gave orders that my men
who had been wounded should be

 

ALMA 57:17-30

taken from among the dead, and
caused that their wounds should
be dressed.

25 And it came to pass that there
were two hundred, out of my two
thousand and sixty, who had fainted
because of the loss of blood; never-
theless, according to the goodness of
God, and to our great astonishment,
and also the joy of our whole army,
there was “not one soul of them who
did perish; yea, and neither was
there one soul among them who
had not received many wounds.

26 And now, their “preservation
was astonishing to our whole army,
yea, that they should be spared
while there was a thousand of our
brethren who were slain. And we
do justly ascribe it to the miracu-
lous "power of God, because of their
exceeding ‘faith in that which they
had been taught to believe—that
there was a just God, and whoso-
ever did not doubt, that they should
be preserved by his marvelous
power.

27 Now this was the “faith of these
of whom I have spoken; they are
young, and their minds are *firm,
and they do put their trust in God
continually.

28 And now it came to pass that
after we had thus taken care of our
wounded men, and had buried our
dead and also the dead of the La-
manites, who were many, behold,
we did inquire of Gid concern-
ing the “prisoners whom they had
started to go down to the land of
Zarahemla with.

29 Now Gid was the chief captain
over the band who was appointed
to guard them down to the land.

30 And now, these are the words
which Gid said unto me: Behold,
we did start to go down to the land
of Zarahemla with our prisoners.
And it came to pass that we did
meet the spies of our armies, who

had been sent out to watch the camp
of the Lamanites.

31 And they cried unto us, say-
ing—Behold, the armies of the La-
manites are marching towards the
city of Cumeni; and behold, they
will fall upon them, yea, and will
destroy our people.

32 And it came to pass that our
prisoners did hear their cries, which
caused them to take courage; and
they did rise up in rebellion against
us.

33 And it came to pass because of
their rebellion we did cause that
our swords should come upon them.
And it came to pass that they did
in a body run upon our swords, in
the which, the greater number of
them were slain; and the remainder
of them broke through and fled
from us.

34 And behold, when they had fled
and we could not overtake them, we
took our march with speed towards
the city Cumeni; and behold, we did
arrive in time that we might assist
our brethren in preserving the city.

35 And behold, we are again de-
livered out of the hands of our en-
emies. And blessed is the name of
our God; for behold, it is he that
has delivered us; yea, that has done
this great thing for us.

36 Now it came to pass that when
I, Helaman, had heard these words
of Gid, I was filled with exceeding
joy because of the goodness of God
in preserving us, that we might
not all perish; yea, and I trust that
the souls of them who have been
slain have “entered into the rest of
their God.

CHAPTER 58

Helaman, Gid, and Teomner take the
city of Manti by a stratagem—The
Lamanites withdraw—The sons of the
people of Ammon are preserved as they
stand fast in defense of their liberty and
faith. About 63-62 B.c.

 

354

AND behold, now it came to pass
that our next object was to obtain
the city of Manti; but behold, there
was no way that we could lead them
out of the city by our small bands.
For behold, they remembered that
which we had hitherto done; there-
fore we could not “decoy them away
from their strongholds.

2 And they were so much more
numerous than was our army that
we durst not go forth and attack
them in their strongholds.

3 Yea, and it became expedient
that we should employ our men to
the maintaining those parts of the
land which we had regained of our
possessions; therefore it became ex-
pedient that we should wait, that we
might receive more strength from
the land of Zarahemla and also a
new supply of provisions.

4 And it came to pass that I thus
did send an embassy to the governor
of our land, to acquaint him con-
cerning the affairs of our people.
And it came to pass that we did wait
to receive provisions and strength
from the land of Zarahemla.

5 But behold, this did profit us but
little; for the Lamanites were also
receiving great strength from day
to day, and also many provisions;
and thus were our circumstances
at this period of time.

6 And the Lamanites were sallying
forth against us from time to time,
resolving by stratagem to destroy us;
nevertheless we could not come to
battle with them, because of their
“retreats and their strongholds.

7 And it came to pass that we did
wait in these difficult circumstances
for the space of many months, even
until we were about to “perish for
the want of food.

8 But it came to pass that we did
receive food, which was guarded to
us by an army of two thousand men
to our assistance; and this is all the
assistance which we did receive, to
defend ourselves and our country

355

from falling into the hands of our
enemies, yea, to contend with an
enemy which was innumerable.

9 And now the cause of these our
embarrassments, or the cause why
they did not send more strength unto
us, we knew not; therefore we were
grieved and also filled with fear, lest
by any means the judgments of God
should come upon our land, to our
overthrow and utter destruction.

10 Therefore we did pour out our
souls in prayer to God, that he would
strengthen us and deliver us out of
the hands of our enemies, yea, and
also give us strength that we might
retain our cities, and our lands, and
our possessions, for the support of
our people.

11 Yea, and it came to pass that
the Lord our God did visit us with
assurances that he would deliver
us; yea, insomuch that he did speak
peace to our souls, and did grant
unto us great faith, and did cause
us that we should hope for our
*deliverance in him.

12 And we did take courage with
our small force which we had re-
ceived, and were fixed with a deter-
mination to conquer our enemies,
and to “maintain our lands, and our
possessions, and our wives, and
our children, and the cause of our
“liberty.

13 And thus we did go forth with
all our might against the Laman-
ites, who were in the city of Manti;
and we did pitch our tents by the
wilderness side, which was near
to the city.

14 And it came to pass that on the
morrow, that when the Lamanites
saw that we were in the borders by
the wilderness which was near the
city, that they sent out their spies
round about us that they might dis-
cover the number and the strength
of our army.

15 And it came to pass that when
they saw that we were not strong,

 

ALMA 58:9-20

according to our numbers, and
fearing that we should cut them
off from their support except they
should come out to battle against
us and kill us, and also supposing
that they could easily destroy us
with their numerous hosts, therefore
they began to make preparations to
come out against us to battle.

16 And when we saw that they
were making preparations to come
out against us, behold, I caused
that Gid, with a small number of
men, should “secrete himself in the
wilderness, and also that Teomner
and a small number of men should
secrete themselves also in the
wilderness.

17 Now Gid and his men were on
the right and the others on the left;
and when they had thus secreted
themselves, behold, I remained,
with the remainder of my army, in
that same place where we had first
pitched our tents against the time
that the Lamanites should come
out to battle.

18 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites did come out with their
numerous army against us. And
when they had come and were about
to fall upon us with the sword, I
caused that my men, those who
were with me, should retreat into
the wilderness.

19 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites did follow after us with
great speed, for they were exceed-
ingly desirous to overtake us that
they might slay us; therefore they did
follow us into the wilderness; and we
did pass by in the midst of Gid and
Teomner, insomuch that they were
not discovered by the Lamanites.

20 And it came to pass that when
the Lamanites had passed by, or
when the army had passed by, Gid
and Teomner did rise up from their
secret places, and did cut off the
spies of the Lamanites that they
should not return to the city.

21 And it came to pass that when
they had cut them off, they ran to
the city and fell upon the guards
who were left to guard the city, in-
somuch that they did destroy them
and did take possession of the city.

22 Now this was done because the
Lamanites did suffer their whole
army, save a few guards only, to be
led away into the wilderness.

23 And it came to pass that Gid
and Teomner by this means had
obtained possession of their strong-
holds. And it came to pass that we
took our course, after having trav-
eled much in the wilderness towards
the land of Zarahemla.

24 And when the Lamanites saw
that they were marching towards
the land of Zarahemla, they were
exceedingly afraid, lest there was
a plan laid to lead them on to de-
struction; therefore they began to
retreat into the wilderness again,
yea, even back by the same way
which they had come.

25 And behold, it was night and
they did pitch their tents, for the
chief *captains of the Lamanites
had supposed that the Nephites
were weary because of their march;
and supposing that they had driven
their whole army therefore they
took no thought concerning the
city of Manti.

26 Now it came to pass that when
it was night, 1 caused that my men
should not sleep, but that they
should march forward by another
way towards the land of Manti.

27 And because of this our march
in the night-time, behold, on the
morrow we were beyond the Laman-
ites, insomuch that we did arrive
before them at the city of Manti.

28 And thus it came to pass, that
by this stratagem we did take pos-
session of the city of Manti without
the shedding of blood.

29 And it came to pass that when
the armies of the Lamanites did

 

356

arrive near the city, and saw that
we were prepared to meet them,
they were astonished exceedingly
and struck with great fear, inso-
much that they did “flee into the
wilderness.

30 Yea, and it came to pass that
the armies of the Lamanites did flee
out of all this quarter of the land.
But behold, they have carried with
them many women and children
out of the land.

31 And “those cities which had
been taken by the Lamanites, all of
them are at this period of time in
our possession; and our fathers and
our women and our children are re-
turning to their homes, all save it be
those who have been taken prisoners
and carried off by the Lamanites.

32 But behold, our armies are small
to maintain so great a number of
cities and so great possessions.

33 But behold, we “trust in our God
who has given us victory over those
lands, insomuch that we have ob-
tained those cities and those lands,
which were our own.

34 Now we do not know the “cause
that the government does not grant
us more strength; neither do those
men who came up unto us know
why we have not received greater
strength.

35 Behold, we do not know but
what “ye are unsuccessful, and ye
have drawn away the forces into
that quarter of the land; if so, we
do not desire to murmur.

36 And if it is not so, behold, we
fear that there is some “faction in
the government, that they do not
send more men to our assistance;
for we know that they are more
numerous than that which they
have sent.

37 But, behold, it mattereth not—
we trust God will ¢deliver us, not-
withstanding the weakness of our
armies, yea, and deliver us out of
the hands of our enemies.

38 Behold, this is the twenty and
ninth year, in the latter end, and we
are in the possession of our lands;
and the Lamanites have fled to the
land of Nephi.

39 And those sons of the people
of Ammon, of whom I have so
highly spoken, are with me in the
city of Manti; and the Lord has sup-
ported them, yea, and kept them
from falling by the sword, inso-
much that even “one soul has not
been slain.

40 But behold, they have received
many wounds; nevertheless they
“stand fast in that °liberty where-
with God has made them free; and
they are strict to remember the Lord
their God from day to day; yea, they
do observe to keep his statutes, and
his judgments, and his command-
ments continually; and their faith
is strong in the prophecies concern-
ing that which is to come.

41 And now, my beloved brother,
Moroni, may the Lord our God, who
has redeemed us and made us free,
keep you continually in his pres-
ence; yea, and may he favor this
people, even that ye may have suc-
cess in obtaining the possession of
all that which the Lamanites have
taken from us, which was for our
support. And now, behold, I close
mine epistle. lam Helaman, the son
of Alma.

CHAPTER 59

Moroni asks Pahoran to strengthen the
forces of Helaman—The Lamanites
take the city of Nephihah—Moroni
is angry with the government. About
62 B.C.

Now it came to pass in the thirtieth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi, after Moroni
had received and had read Hela-
man’s “epistle, he was exceedingly
rejoiced because of the welfare, yea,

 

ALMA 58:38-59:8

the exceeding success which Hela-
man had had, in obtaining ’those
lands which were lost.

2 Yea, and he did make it known
unto all his people, in all the land
round about in that part where he
was, that they might rejoice also.

3 And it came to pass that he
immediately sent “an epistle to
’Pahoran, desiring that he should
cause men to be gathered together
to strengthen Helaman, or the
armies of Helaman, insomuch that
he might with ease maintain
that part of the land which he had
been so miraculously prospered in
regaining.

4 And it came to pass when Mo-
roni had sent this epistle to the
land of Zarahemla, he began again
to lay a plan that he might obtain
the remainder of those possessions
and cities which the Lamanites had
taken from them.

5 And it came to pass that while
Moroni was thus making prepara-
tions to go against the Lamanites
to battle, behold, the people of
*Nephihah, who were gathered
together from the city of Moroni
and the city of Lehi and the city
of Morianton, were attacked by the
Lamanites.

6 Yea, even those who had been
“compelled to flee from the land
of Manti, and from the land round
about, had come over and joined the
Lamanites in this part of the land.

7 And thus being exceedingly nu-
merous, yea, and receiving strength
from day to day, by the command of
Ammoron they came forth against
the people of Nephihah, and they
did begin to slay them with an ex-
ceedingly great slaughter.

8 And their armies were so nu-
merous that the remainder of the
people of “Nephihah were obliged
to flee before them; and they came
even and joined the army of Moroni.

9 And now as Moroni had supposed
that there ¢should be men sent to
the city of Nephihah, to the assis-
tance of the people to maintain that
city, and knowing that it was easier
to keep the city from falling into
the hands of the Lamanites than to
retake it from them, he supposed
that they would easily maintain
that city.

10 Therefore he retained all his
force to maintain those places which
he had recovered.

11 And now, when Moroni saw
that the city of Nephihah was “lost
he was exceedingly sorrowful, and
began to doubt, because of the wick-
edness of the people, whether they
should not fall into the hands of
their brethren.

12 Now this was the case with all
his chief captains. They doubted
and marveled also because of the
wickedness of the people, and this
because of the success of the La-
manites over them.

13 And it came to pass that Mo-
roni was angry with the govern-
ment, because of their “indifference
concerning the freedom of their
country.

CHAPTER 60

Moroni complains to Pahoran of the
government’s neglect of the armies—
The Lord suffers the righteous to be
slain—The Nephites must use all of their
power and means to deliver themselves
from their enemies—Moroni threat-
ens to fight against the government
unless help is supplied to his armies.
About 62 B.C.

AND it came to pass that he wrote
“again to the governor of the land,
who was Pahoran, and these are
the words which he wrote, saying:
Behold, I direct mine epistle to
Pahoran, in the city of Zarahemla,
who is the chief judge and the °gov-
ernor over the land, and also to all

 

358

those who have been chosen by this
people to govern and manage the
affairs of this war.

2 For behold, I have somewhat to
say unto them by the way of ¢con-
demnation; for behold, ye yourselves
know that ye have been appointed
to gather together men, and arm
them with swords, and with cime-
ters, and all manner of weapons of
war of every kind, and send forth
against the Lamanites, in whatso-
ever parts they should come into
our land.

3 And now behold, I say unto you
that myself, and also my men, and
also Helaman and his men, have
suffered exceedingly great “suffer-
ings; yea, even hunger, thirst, and
fatigue, and all manner of afflic-
tions of every kind.

4 But behold, were this all we had
suffered we would not murmur nor
complain.

5 But behold, great has been the
slaughter among our people; yea,
thousands have fallen by the sword,
while it might have otherwise been
if ye had rendered unto our armies
sufficient strength and succor for
them. Yea, great has been your ne-
glect towards us.

6 And now behold, we desire to
know the cause of this exceedingly
great neglect; yea, we desire to
know the cause of your thought-
less state.

7 Can you think to sit upon your
thrones in a state of thoughtless
“stupor, while your enemies are
spreading the work of death around
you? Yea, while they are murdering
thousands of your brethren—

8 Yea, even they who have looked
up to you for protection, yea, have
placed you in a situation that ye
might have succored them, yea,
ye might have sent armies unto
them, to have strengthened them,
and have saved thousands of them
from falling by the sword.

9 But behold, this is not all—ye
have withheld your provisions from
them, insomuch that many have
fought and bled out their lives be-
cause of their great desires which
they had for the welfare of this peo-
ple; yea, and this they have done
when they were about to “perish with
hunger, because of your exceedingly
great neglect towards them.

10 And now, my beloved breth-
ren—for ye ought to be beloved; yea,
and ye ought to have stirred your-
selves more diligently for the wel-
fare and the freedom of this people;
but behold, ye have neglected them
insomuch that the blood of thou-
sands shall come upon your heads
for vengeance; yea, for *known
unto God were all their cries, and
all their sufferings—

11 Behold, could ye suppose that
ye could sit upon your thrones, and
because of the exceeding goodness
of God ye could do nothing and he
would deliver you? Behold, if ye
have supposed this ye have sup-
posed in vain.

12 Do ye “suppose that, because so
many of your brethren have been
killed it is because of their wicked-
ness? I say unto you, if ye have sup-
posed this ye have supposed in vain;
for I say unto you, there are many
who have fallen by the sword; and
behold it is to your condemnation;

13 For the Lord suffereth the
“righteous to be slain that his jus-
tice and "judgment may come upon
the wicked; therefore ye need not
suppose that the righteous are lost
because they are slain; but behold,
they do enter into the rest of the
Lord their God.

14 And now behold, I say unto
you, I fear exceedingly that the
judgments of God will come upon
this people, because of their ex-
ceeding “slothfulness, yea, even the

 

ALMA 60:9-18

slothfulness of our government, and
their exceedingly great neglect to-
wards their brethren, yea, towards
those who have been slain.

15 For were it not for the wick-
edness which first commenced at
our head, we “could have withstood
our enemies that they could have
gained no power over us.

16 Yea, had it not been for the war
which broke out “among ourselves;
yea, were it not for these ’king-men,
who caused so much bloodshed
among ourselves; yea, at the time we
were contending among ourselves,
if we had united our strength as we
hitherto have done; yea, had it not
been for the desire of power and au-
thority which those king-men had
over us; had they been true to the
cause of our freedom, and united
with us, and gone forth against our
enemies, instead of taking up their
swords against us, which was the
cause of so much bloodshed among
ourselves; yea, if we had gone forth
against them in the strength of the
Lord, we should have dispersed our
enemies, for it would have been
done, according to the ‘fulfilling
of his word.

17 But behold, now the Laman-
ites are coming upon us, taking
“possession of our lands, and they
are murdering our people with the
sword, yea, our women and our
children, and also carrying them
away captive, causing them that
they should suffer all manner of
afflictions, and this because of the
great wickedness of those who are
seeking for power and authority,
yea, even those king-men.

18 But why should I say much con-
cerning this matter? For we know
not but what ye yourselves are seek-
ing for authority. We know not but
what ye are also “traitors to your
country.

19 Or is it that ye have neglected
us because ye are in the heart of our
country and ye are “surrounded by
security, that ye do not cause food
to be sent unto us, and also men to
strengthen our armies?

20 Have ye forgotten the com-
mandments of the Lord your God?
Yea, have ye forgotten the captivity
of our fathers? Have ye forgotten the
many times we have been delivered
out of the hands of our enemies?

21 Or do ye suppose that the Lord
will still deliver us, while we sit
upon our thrones and do not make
use of the means which the Lord
has provided for us?

22 Yea, will ye sit in idleness while
ye are surrounded with thousands
of those, yea, and tens of thousands,
who do also sit in idleness, while
there are thousands round about
in the borders of the land who are
falling by the sword, yea, wounded
and bleeding?

23 Do ye suppose that God will
look upon you as guiltless while ye
sit still and behold these things?
Behold I say unto you, Nay. Now
I would that ye should remember
that God has said that the “inward
vessel shall be ’cleansed first,
and then shall the outer vessel be
cleansed also.

24 And now, except ye do repent
of that which ye have done, and
begin to be up and doing, and send
forth food and men unto us, and also
unto Helaman, that he may support
those parts of our country which
he has regained, and that we may
also recover the remainder of our
possessions in these parts, behold it
will be expedient that we contend
no more with the Lamanites until
we have first cleansed our inward
vessel, yea, even the great head of
our government.

25 And except ye grant mine epis-
tle, and come out and show unto
me a true “spirit of freedom, and

 

360

strive to strengthen and fortify our
armies, and grant unto them food
for their support, behold I will leave
a part of my freemen to maintain
this part of our land, and I will
leave the strength and the blessings
of God upon them, that none other
power can operate against them—

26 And this because of their ex-
ceeding faith, and their patience
in their “tribulations—

27 And I will come unto you, and
if there be any among you that
has a desire for freedom, yea, if
there be even a spark of freedom
remaining, behold I will stir up in-
surrections among you, even until
those who have desires to usurp
power and authority shall become
extinct.

28 Yea, behold I do not fear your
power nor your authority, but it
is my *God whom I fear; and it is
according to his commandments
that I do take my sword to defend
the cause of my country, and it is
because of your iniquity that we
have suffered so much loss.

29 Behold it is time, yea, the time
is now at hand, that except ye do
bestir yourselves in the defence of
your country and your little ones,
the ¢sword of justice doth hang over
you; yea, and it shall fall upon you
and visit you even to your utter
destruction.

30 Behold, I wait for assistance
from you; and, except ye do ad-
minister unto our relief, behold, I
come unto you, even in the land of
Zarahemla, and smite you with the
sword, insomuch that ye can have no
more power to impede the progress
of this people in the cause of our
freedom.

31 For behold, the Lord will not
suffer that ye shall live and wax
strong in your iniquities to destroy
his righteous people.

the Lord will spare you and come

out in judgment against the Laman-

fathers that has caused their hatred,
yea, and it has been redoubled by
those who have dissented from us,
while your iniquity is for the cause
of your love of glory and the vain
things of the world?

33 Ye know that ye do transgress
the laws of God, and ye do know that
ye do trample them under your feet.
Behold, the Lord saith unto me: If
those whom ye have appointed your
governors do not repent of their sins
and “iniquities, ye shall "go up to
battle against them.

34 And now behold, I, Moroni, am
constrained, according to the cov-
enant which I have made to keep the
commandments of my God; there-
fore I would that ye should adhere
to the word of God, and send speed-
ily unto me of your provisions and
of your men, and also to Helaman.

35 And behold, if ye will not do this
Icome unto you speedily; for behold,
God will not suffer that we should
perish with hunger; therefore he
will give unto us of your food,
even if it must be by the sword. Now
see that ye fulfil the word of God.

36 Behold, lam Moroni, your chief
captain. I “seek not for power, but to
pull it down. I °seek not for honor
of the world, but for the glory of
my God, and the freedom and wel-
fare of my country. And thus I close
mine epistle.

CHAPTER 61

Pahoran tells Moroni of the insurrection
and rebellion against the government—
The king-men take Zarahemla and are
in league with the Lamanites—Pahoran
asks for military aid against the rebels.
About 62 B.c.

BEHOLD, now it came to pass that

 

ALMA 60:33-61:7

soon after Moroni had sent his
epistle unto the chief governor, he
received an epistle from “Pahoran,
the chief governor. And these are
the words which he received:

2 1, Pahoran, who am the chief
governor of this land, do send these
words unto Moroni, the chief cap-
tain over the army. Behold, I say
unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy
in your great “afflictions, yea, it
grieves my soul.

3 But behold, there are those who
do joy in your afflictions, yea, in-
somuch that they have risen up in
“rebellion against me, and also those
of my people who are freemen,
yea, and those who have risen up
are exceedingly numerous.

4 And it is those who have sought
to take away the judgment-seat
from me that have been the cause
of this great iniquity; for they have
used great “flattery, and they have
bled away the hearts of many peo-
ple, which will be the cause of
sore affliction among us; they have
withheld our provisions, and have
daunted our ‘freemen that they
have not come unto you.

5 And behold, they have driven
me out before them, and I have
fled to the land of Gideon, with as
many men as it were possible that
I could get.

6 And behold, I have sent a procla-
mation throughout this part of the
land; and behold, they are “flock-
ing to us ’daily, to their arms, in
the defence of their country and
their ‘freedom, and to avenge our
4wrongs.

7 And they have come unto us, in-
somuch that those who have risen
up in rebellion against us are set at
defiance, yea, insomuch that they
do fear us and durst not come out
against us to battle.

8 They have “got possession of the
land, or the city, of Zarahemla; they
have appointed a king over them,
and he hath written unto the king
of the Lamanites, in the which he
hath joined an alliance with him; in
the which alliance he hath agreed
to maintain the city of Zarahemla,
which maintenance he supposeth
will enable the Lamanites to con-
quer the remainder of the land,
and he shall be placed king over
this people when they shall be con-
quered ‘under the Lamanites.

9 And now, in your epistle you
have “censured me, but it mattereth
not; lam not angry, but do rejoice
in the greatness of your heart. I,
Pahoran, do not ’seek for power,
save only to retain my judgment-
seat that I may preserve the rights
and the liberty of my people. My
soul standeth fast in that liberty in
the which God hath made us “free.

10 And now, behold, we will resist
wickedness even unto bloodshed.
We would “not shed the blood of
the Lamanites if they would stay
in their own land.

11 We would not shed the blood
of our brethren if they would not
rise up in rebellion and take the
sword against us.

12 We would subject ourselves
to the “yoke of bondage if it were
requisite with the justice of God, or
if he should command us so to do.

13 But behold he doth not com-
mand us that we shall subject our-
selves to our enemies, but that we
should put our “trust in him, and
he will deliver us.

14 Therefore, my beloved brother,
Moroni, let us resist evil, and what-
soever evil we cannot resist with
our “words, yea, such as rebellions

 

362

and dissensions, let us °resist them
with our swords, that we may retain
our freedom, that we may rejoice in
the great privilege of our church,
and in the cause of our Redeemer
and our God.

15 Therefore, come unto me speed-
ily with a few of your men, and
leave the remainder in the charge
of Lehi and Teancum; give unto
them power to conduct the ¢war in
that part of the land, according to
the ’Spirit of God, which is also the
‘spirit of freedom which is in them.

16 Behold I have sent a few provi-
sions unto them, that they may not
perish until ye can come unto me.

17 Gather together whatsoever
force ye can upon your march hither,
and we will go speedily against
those dissenters, in the strength
of our God according to the faith
which is in us.

18 And we will take possession of
the city of Zarahemla, that we may
obtain more food to send forth unto
Lehi and Teancum; yea, we will go
forth against them in the strength
of the Lord, and we will put an end
to this great iniquity.

19 And now, Moroni, I do joy in
receiving your epistle, for I was
somewhat worried concerning what
we should do, whether it should be
just in us to go against our brethren.

20 But ye have said, except they
repent the Lord “hath commanded
you that ye should go against them.

21 See that ye “strengthen Lehi and
Teancum in the Lord; tell them to
fear not, for God will deliver them,
yea, and also all those who ’stand
fast in that liberty wherewith God
hath made them free. And now I
close mine epistle to my beloved
brother, Moroni.

CHAPTER 62

Moroni marches to the aid of Pahoran
in the land of Gideon—The king-men
who refuse to defend their country are
put to death—Pahoran and Moroni re-
take Nephihah—Many Lamanites join
the people of Ammon—Teancum slays
Ammoron and is in turn slain—The
Lamanites are driven from the land,
and peace is established—Helaman
returns to the ministry and builds up
the Church. About 62-57 B.C.

AND now it came to pass that when
Moroni had received this epistle
his heart did take courage, and was
filled with exceedingly great joy be-
cause of the faithfulness of Pahoran,
that he was not also a “traitor to the
freedom and cause of his country.

2 But he did also mourn exceed-
ingly because of the iniquity of those
who had driven Pahoran from the
judgment-seat, yea, in fine because
of those who had rebelled against
their country and also their God.

3 And it came to pass that Moroni
took a small number of men, ac-
cording to the desire of Pahoran,
and gave Lehi and Teancum com-
mand over the remainder of his
army, and took his march towards
the land of Gideon.

4 And he did raise the “standard
of "liberty in whatsoever place he
did enter, and gained whatsoever
force he could in all his march to-
wards the land of Gideon.

5 And it came to pass that thou-
sands did “flock unto his standard,
and did take up their swords in the
defence of their freedom, that they
might not come into bondage.

6 And thus, when Moroni had
gathered together whatsoever men
he could in all his march, he came
to the land of Gideon; and uniting
his forces with those of Pahoran
they became exceedingly strong,
even stronger than the men of

 

ALMA 62:1-13

Pachus, who was the “king of those
dissenters who had driven the
*freemen out of the land of Zara-
hemla and had taken possession
of the land.

7 And it came to pass that Mo-
roni and Pahoran went down with
their armies into the land of Zara-
hemla, and went forth against the
city, and did meet the men of Pa-
chus, insomuch that they did come
to battle.

8 And behold, Pachus was slain
and his men were taken prisoners,
and Pahoran was restored to his
judgment-seat.

9 And the men of Pachus received
their trial, according to the law, and
also those king-men who had been
taken and “cast into prison; and
they were "executed according to
the law; yea, those men of Pachus
and those ‘king-men, whosoever
would not take up arms in the de-
fence of their country, but would
fight against it, were put to death.

10 And thus it became expedient
that this law should be strictly ob-
served for the safety of their coun-
try; yea, and whosoever was found
denying their freedom was speed-
ily “executed according to the law.

11 And thus ended the thirtieth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi; Moroni and
Pahoran having restored peace to
the land of Zarahemla, among their
own people, having “inflicted death
upon all those who were not true
to the cause of freedom.

12 And it came to pass in the
commencement of the thirty and
first year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi, Moroni
immediately caused that provisions
should be sent, and also an army
of six thousand men should be sent
unto Helaman, to assist him in pre-
serving that part of the land.

13 And he also caused that an

army of six thousand men, witha
sufficient quantity of food, should
be sent to the armies of Lehi and
Teancum. And it came to pass that
this was done to fortify the land
against the Lamanites.

14 And it came to pass that Moroni
and Pahoran, leaving a large body of
men in the land of Zarahemla, took
their march with a large body of
men towards the land of Nephihah,
being determined to “overthrow the
Lamanites in that city.

15 And it came to pass that as they
were marching towards the land,
they took a large body of men of
the Lamanites, and slew many of
them, and took their provisions and
their weapons of war.

16 And it came to pass after they
had taken them, they caused them
to enter into a “covenant that they
would no more take up their weap-
ons of war against the Nephites.

17 And when they had entered
into this covenant they sent them to
“dwell with the people of Ammon,
and they were in number about four
thousand who had not been slain.

18 And it came to pass that when
they had sent them away they pur-
sued their march towards the land
of *Nephihah. And it came to pass
that when they had come to the city
of Nephihah, they did pitch their
tents in the plains of Nephihah,
which is near the city of Nephihah.

19 Now Moroni was desirous that
the Lamanites should come out
to battle against them, upon the
plains; but the Lamanites, knowing
of their exceedingly great courage,
and beholding the greatness of
their numbers, therefore they durst
not come out against them; there-
fore they did not come to battle in
that day.

20 And when the night came,
Moroni went forth in the darkness
of the night, and came upon the
top of the wall to spy out in what

 

364

part of the city the Lamanites did
camp with their army.

21 And it came to pass that they
were on the east, by the entrance;
and they were all asleep. And now
Moroni returned to his army, and
caused that they should prepare
in haste strong cords and ladders,
to be let down from the top of the
wall into the inner part of the wall.

22 And it came to pass that Moroni
caused that his men should march
forth and come upon the top of the
wall, and let “themselves down into
that part of the city, yea, even on
the west, where the Lamanites did
not camp with their armies.

23 And it came to pass that they
were all let down into the city by
night, by the means of their strong
cords and their ladders; thus when
the morning came they were all
within the walls of the city.

24 And now, when the Lamanites
awoke and saw that the armies of
Moroni were within the walls, they
were affrighted exceedingly, in-
somuch that they did flee out by
the pass.

25 And now when Moroni saw
that they were fleeing before him,
he did cause that his men should
march forth against them, and slew
many, and surrounded many oth-
ers, and took them prisoners; and
the remainder of them fled into the
land of Moroni, which was in the
borders by the seashore.

26 Thus had Moroni and Pahoran
obtained the “possession of the city
of Nephihah without the loss of one
soul; and there were many of the
Lamanites who were slain.

27 Now it came to pass that many
of the Lamanites that were prisoners
were desirous to “join the people of
Ammon and become a free people.

28 And it came to pass that as many
as were desirous, unto them it was
granted according to their desires.

29 Therefore, all the prisoners of

the Lamanites did join the people
of Ammon, and did begin to labor
exceedingly, tilling the ground, rais-
ing all manner of grain, and flocks
and herds of every kind; and thus
were the Nephites relieved froma
great burden; yea, insomuch that
they were relieved from all the
prisoners of the Lamanites.

30 Now it came to pass that Moroni,
after he had obtained possession of
the city of Nephihah, having taken
many prisoners, which did reduce
the armies of the Lamanites exceed-
ingly, and having regained many of
the Nephites who had been taken
prisoners, which did strengthen the
army of Moroni exceedingly; there-
fore Moroni went forth from the land
of Nephihah to the land of “Lehi.

31 And it came to pass that when
the Lamanites saw that Moroni was
coming against them, they were
again frightened and fled before
the army of Moroni.

32 And it came to pass that *“Mo-
roni and his army did pursue them
from city to city, until they were
met by Lehi and Teancum; and the
Lamanites fled from Lehi and Tean-
cum, even down upon the borders
by the seashore, until they came to
the land of Moroni.

33 And the armies of the Laman-
ites were all gathered together, in-
somuch that they were all in one
body in the land of Moroni. Now
Ammoron, the king of the Laman-
ites, was also with them.

34 And it came to pass that Moroni
and Lehi and Teancum did encamp
with their armies round about in
the borders of the land of Moroni,
insomuch that the Lamanites were
encircled about in the borders by
the wilderness on the south, and
in the borders by the wilderness on
the east.

35 And thus they did encamp for
the night. For behold, the Neph-
ites and the Lamanites also were

 

ALMA 62:30-40

weary because of the greatness of
the march; therefore they did not
resolve upon any stratagem in the
night-time, save it were Teancum;
for he was exceedingly angry with
Ammoron, insomuch that he con-
sidered that Ammoron, and Amal-
ickiah his brother, had been the
“cause of this great and lasting war
between them and the Lamanites,
which had been the cause of so much
war and bloodshed, yea, and so
much famine.

36 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum in his anger did go forth into
the camp of the Lamanites, and did
let himself down over the walls of
the city. And he went forth with a
cord, from place to place, insomuch
that he did find the king; and he
did “cast a javelin at him, which
did pierce him near the heart. But
behold, the king did awaken his
servants before he died, insomuch
that they did pursue Teancum, and
slew him.

37 Now it came to pass that when
Lehi and Moroni knew that Tean-
cum was dead they were exceedingly
sorrowful; for behold, he had been
a man who had “fought valiantly
for his country, yea, a true friend
to liberty; and he had suffered very
many exceedingly sore afflictions.
But behold, he was dead, and had
gone the way of all the earth.

38 Now it came to pass that Mo-
roni marched forth on the morrow,
and came upon the Lamanites, inso-
much that they did slay them with
a great slaughter; and they did drive
them out of the land; and they did
flee, even that they did not return
at that time against the Nephites.

39 And thus ended the thirty and
first year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi; and thus
they had had wars, and bloodsheds,
and famine, and affliction, for the
space of many years.

40 And there had been murders,

and contentions, and dissensions,
and all manner of iniquity among
the people of Nephi; nevertheless
for the “righteous’ sake, yea, because
of the prayers of the righteous, they
were spared.

41 But behold, because of the ex-
ceedingly great length of the war
between the Nephites and the La-
manites many had become hard-
ened, because of the exceedingly
great length of the war; and many
were softened because of their “af-
flictions, insomuch that they did
humble themselves before God, even
in the depth of humility.

42 And it came to pass that after
Moroni had fortified those parts of
the land which were most exposed
to the Lamanites, until they were
sufficiently strong, he returned to
the city of Zarahemla; and also He-
laman returned to the place of his
inheritance; and there was once
more peace established among the
people of Nephi.

43 And Moroni yielded up the
“command of his armies into the
hands of his son, whose name was
’Moronihah; and he retired to his
own house that he might spend the
remainder of his days in peace.

44 And Pahoran did return to his
judgment-seat; and Helaman did
take upon him again to preach unto
the people the word of God; for
because of so many wars and con-
tentions it had become expedient
that a “regulation should be made
again in the church.

45 Therefore, Helaman and his
brethren went forth, and did de-
clare the word of God with much
power unto the “convincing of many
people of their wickedness, which
did cause them to repent of their
sins and to be baptized unto the
Lord their God.

 

366

46 And it came to pass that they
did establish again the church of
God, throughout all the land.

47 Yea, and regulations were made
concerning the law. And their
“judges, and their chief judges were
chosen.

48 And the people of Nephi be-
gan to “prosper again in the land,
and began to multiply and to wax
exceedingly strong again in the
land. And they began to grow ex-
ceedingly rich.

49 But notwithstanding their
riches, or their strength, or their
prosperity, they were not lifted up
in the pride of their eyes; neither
were they “slow to remember the
Lord their God; but they did humble
themselves exceedingly before him.

50 Yea, they did remember how
great things the Lord had done for
them, that he had ¢delivered them
from death, and from bonds, and
from prisons, and from all manner
of ’afflictions, and he had ‘deliv-
ered them out of the hands of their
enemies.

51 And they did pray unto the
Lord their God continually, inso-
much that the Lord did bless them,
according to his word, so that they
did wax strong and “prosper in the
land.

52 And it came to pass that all
these things were done. And “He-
laman died, in the thirty and fifth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi.

AND it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the thirty and sixth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi, that *Shiblon
took possession of those ’sacred
things which had been delivered
unto Helaman by Alma.

2 And he was a just man, and he
did walk uprightly before God; and
he did observe to do good continu-
ally, to keep the commandments
of the Lord his God; and also did
his brother.

3 And it came to pass that *Mo-
roni died also. And thus ended the
thirty and sixth year of the reign
of the judges.

4 And it came to pass that in the
thirty and seventh year of the reign
of the judges, there was a large com-
pany of men, even to the amount
of five thousand and four hundred
men, with their wives and their
children, departed out of the land
of Zarahemla into the land which
was “northward.

5 And it came to pass that Hagoth,
he being an “exceedingly curious
man, therefore he went forth and
built him an exceedingly large ship,
on the borders of the land "Boun-
tiful, by the land Desolation, and
launched it forth into the west sea,
by the ‘narrow neck which led into
the land northward.

6 And behold, there were many of
the Nephites who did enter therein
and did sail forth with much pro-
visions, and also many women and
children; and they took their course
northward. And thus ended the
thirty and seventh year.

7 And in the thirty and eighth year,
this man built “other ships. And
the first ship did also return, and

 

ALMA 63:1-14

many more people did enter into
it; and they also took much provi-
sions, and set out again to the land
northward.

8 And it came to pass that they
were never heard of more. And we
suppose that they were drowned in
the depths of the sea. And it came
to pass that one other ship also did
sail forth; and whither she did go
we know not.

9 And it came to pass that in this
year there were many people who
went forth into the land “north-
ward. And thus ended the thirty
and eighth year.

10 And it came to pass in the thirty
and ninth year of the reign of the
judges, “Shiblon died also, and
Corianton had gone forth to the
land northward in a ship, to carry
forth provisions unto the people
who had gone forth into that land.

11 Therefore it became expedient
for *Shiblon to confer those sacred
things, before his death, upon the
son of "Helaman, who was called
‘Helaman, being called after the
name of his father.

12 Now behold, all those “engrav-
ings which were in the possession
of Helaman were written and sent
forth among the children of men
throughout all the land, save it
were those parts which had been
commanded by Alma should ’not
go forth.

13 Nevertheless, these things were
to be kept sacred, and “handed
down from one generation to an-
other; therefore, in this year, they
had been conferred upon Helaman,
before the death of Shiblon.

14 And it came to pass also in this
year that there were some dissenters

who had gone forth unto the La-

again to anger against the Nephites.

15 And also in this same year
they came down with a numerous
army to war against the people
of ¢“Moronihah, or against the army of
Moronihah, in the which they were

368

beaten and driven back again to
their own lands, suffering great loss.

16 And thus ended the thirty and
ninth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi.

17 And thus ended the account of
2Alma, and Helaman his son, and
also Shiblon, who was his son.

CHAPTER 1

Pahoran the second becomes chief judge
and is murdered by Kishkumen—Pacu-
meni fills the judgment seat—Corian-
tumr leads the Lamanite armies, takes
Zarahemla, and slays Pacumeni—Mo-
ronihah defeats the Lamanites and re-
takes Zarahemla, and Coriantumr is
slain. About 52-50 B.c.

ND now behold, it came to pass
in the commencement of the
fortieth year of the reign of
the judges over the people of Nephi,
there began to be aserious difficulty
among the people of the Nephites.
2 For behold, “Pahoran had died,
and gone the way of all the earth;
therefore there began to be a serious
contention concerning who should
have the judgment-seat among the
brethren, who were the sons of
Pahoran.
3 Now these are their names who

 

did contend for the judgment-seat,
who did also cause the people to
contend: Pahoran, Paanchi, and
Pacumeni.

4 Now these are not all the sons
of Pahoran (for he had many), but
these are they who did contend for
the judgment-seat; therefore, they
did cause three “divisions among
the people.

5 Nevertheless, it came to pass
that Pahoran was appointed by
the “voice of the people to be chief
judge and a governor over the people
of Nephi.

6 And it came to pass that Pacu-
meni, when he saw that he could
not obtain the judgment-seat, he
did “unite with the voice of the
people.

7 But behold, Paanchi, and that
part of the people that were desir-
ous that he should be their governor,
was exceedingly wroth; therefore,

he was about to “flatter away those
people to rise up in rebellion against
their brethren.

8 And it came to pass as he was
about to do this, behold, he was
taken, and was tried according to
the “voice of the people, and con-
demned unto death; for he had
raised up in rebellion and sought to
destroy the °liberty of the people.

9 Now when those people who
were desirous that he should be
their governor saw that he was
condemned unto death, therefore
they were angry, and behold, they
sent forth one “Kishkumen, even to
the judgment-seat of Pahoran, and
murdered Pahoran as he sat upon
the judgment-seat.

10 And he was pursued by the
servants of Pahoran; but behold, so
speedy was the flight of Kishkumen
that no man could overtake him.

11 And he went unto those that
sent him, and they all entered into
a covenant, yea, “swearing by their
everlasting Maker, that they would
tell no man that Kishkumen had
murdered Pahoran.

12 Therefore, Kishkumen was not
known among the people of Nephi,
for he was in disguise at the time
that he murdered Pahoran. And
Kishkumen and his band, who had
covenanted with him, did mingle
themselves among the people, ina
manner that they all could not be
found; but as many as were found
were condemned unto “death.

13 And now behold, Pacumeni was
appointed, according to the *voice
of the people, to be a chief judge
and a governor over the people, to
reign in the stead of his brother
Pahoran; and it was according to
his right. And all this was done in
the fortieth year of the reign of the
judges; and it had an end.

14 And it came to pass in the forty

 

HELAMAN 1:8-19

and first year of the reign of the
judges, that the Lamanites had
gathered together an innumerable
army of men, and ¢7armed them with
swords, and with cimeters and
with bows, and with arrows, and with
head-plates, and with breastplates,
and with all manner of shields of
every kind.

15 And they came down again that
they might pitch battle against the
Nephites. And they were led by a
man whose name was “Coriantumr;
and he was a descendant of Zara-
hemla; and he was a dissenter from
among the Nephites; and he was a
large and a mighty man.

16 Therefore, the king of the La-
manites, whose name was Tubal-
oth, who was the son of 7Ammoron,
supposing that Coriantumr, being
a mighty man, could stand against
the Nephites, with his strength and
also with his great wisdom, inso-
much that by sending him forth
he should gain power over the
Nephites—

17 Therefore he did “stir them up
to anger, and he did gather together
his armies, and he did appoint Co-
riantumr to be their leader, and
did cause that they should march
down to the land of Zarahemla to
battle against the Nephites.

18 And it came to pass that because
of so much contention and so much
difficulty in the government, that
they had not kept sufficient guards
in the land of Zarahemla; for they
had supposed that the Lamanites
durst not come into the heart of
their lands to attack that great city
Zarahemla.

19 But it came to pass that Corian-
tumr did march forth at the head
of his numerous host, and came
upon the inhabitants of the city,
and their march was with such
exceedingly great speed that there

was no time for the Nephites to
gather together their armies.

20 Therefore Coriantumr did cut
down the watch by the entrance
of the city, and did march forth
with his whole army into the city,
and they did slay every one who
did oppose them, insomuch that
they did take possession of the
whole city.

21 And it came to pass that Pacu-
meni, who was the chief judge, did
flee before Coriantumr, even to
the walls of the city. And it came
to pass that Coriantumr did smite
him against the wall, insomuch that
he died. And thus ended the days
of Pacumeni.

22 And now when Coriantumr
saw that he was in possession of
the city of Zarahemla, and saw that
the Nephites had fled before them,
and were slain, and were taken, and
were cast into prison, and that he
had obtained the possession of the
strongest hold in all the land, his
heart “took courage insomuch that
he was about to go forth against all
the land.

23 And now he did not tarry in
the land of Zarahemla, but he did
march forth with a large army, even
towards the city of “Bountiful; for
it was his determination to go forth
and cut his way through with the
sword, that he might obtain the
north parts of the land.

24 And, supposing that their great-
est strength was in the center of the
land, therefore he did march forth,
giving them no time to assemble
themselves together save it were in
small bodies; and in this manner
they did fall upon them and cut
them down to the earth.

25 But behold, this march of Co-
riantumr through the center of the
land gave Moronihah great advan-
tage over them, notwithstanding
the greatness of the number of the
Nephites who were slain.

26 For behold, Moronihah had

 

370

supposed that the Lamanites durst
not come into the center of the
land, but that they would attack the
cities round about in the borders
as they had hitherto done; there-
fore Moronihah had caused that
their strong armies should main-
tain those parts round about by the
borders.

27 But behold, the Lamanites were
not frightened according to his de-
sire, but they had come into the
center of the land, and had taken
the capital city which was the city
of Zarahemla, and were marching
through the most capital parts of
the land, slaying the people witha
great slaughter, both men, women,
and children, taking possession of
many cities and of many strongholds.

28 But when Moronihah had dis-
covered this, he immediately sent
forth Lehi with an army round about
to “head them before they should
come to the land Bountiful.

29 And thus he did; and he did
head them before they came to the
land Bountiful, and gave unto them
battle, insomuch that they began
to retreat back towards the land
of Zarahemla.

30 And it came to pass that Moroni-
hah did head them in their retreat,
and did give unto them battle, in-
somuch that it became an exceed-
ingly bloody battle; yea, many were
slain, and among the number who
were slain *Coriantumr was also
found.

31 And now, behold, the Lamanites
could not retreat either way, neither
on the north, nor on the south, nor on
the east, nor on the west, for they
were surrounded on every hand by
the Nephites.

32 And thus had Coriantumr
plunged the Lamanites into the
midst of the Nephites, insomuch
that they were in the power of the
Nephites, and he himself was slain,
and the Lamanites did “yield them-
selves into the hands of the Nephites.

33 And it came to pass that Moroni-
hah took possession of the city of
Zarahemla again, and caused that
the Lamanites who had been taken
prisoners should depart out of the
land in “peace.

34 And thus ended the forty and
first year of the reign of the judges.

CHAPTER 2

Helaman, the son of Helaman, becomes
chief judge—Gadianton leads the band
of Kishkumen—Helaman’s servant
slays Kishkumen, and the Gadianton
band flees into the wilderness. About
50-49 B.C.

AND it came to pass in the forty
and second year of the reign of
the judges, after Moronihah had
established again peace between
the Nephites and the Lamanites,
behold there was no one to fill the
judgment-seat; therefore there be-
gan to be acontention again among
the people concerning who should
fill the judgment-seat.

2 And it came to pass that “Hela-
man, who was the son of Helaman,
was appointed to fill the judgment-
seat, by the 'voice of the people.

3 But behold, “Kishkumen, who
had murdered Pahoran, did lay
wait to destroy Helaman also; and
he was upheld by his band, who
had entered into a covenant that no
one should know his wickedness.

4 For there was one “Gadianton,
who was exceedingly expert in many
words, and also in his craft, to carry
on the secret work of murder and
of robbery; therefore he became the
leader of the band of Kishkumen.

5 Therefore he did “flatter them,
and also Kishkumen, that if they
would place him in the judgment-
seat he would grant unto those
who belonged to his band that they
should be placed in power and au-
thority among the people; there-

 

HELAMAN 1:33-2:11

fore Kishkumen sought to destroy
Helaman.

6 And it came to pass as he went
forth towards the judgment-seat
to destroy Helaman, behold one of
the servants of Helaman, having
been out by night, and having ob-
tained, through disguise, a knowl-
edge of those plans which had
been laid by this band to destroy
Helaman—

7 And it came to pass that he met
Kishkumen, and he gave unto him
a sign; therefore Kishkumen made
known unto him the object of his
desire, desiring that he would con-
duct him to the judgment-seat that
he might murder Helaman.

8 And when the servant of He-
laman had Known all the heart of
Kishkumen, and how that it was his
“object to murder, and also that it
was the object of all those who be-
longed to his band to murder, and
to rob, and to gain power, (and this
was their "secret plan, and their
combination) the servant of Hela-
man said unto Kishkumen: Let us
go forth unto the judgment-seat.

9 Now this did please Kishkumen
exceedingly, for he did suppose that
he should accomplish his design;
but behold, the servant of Helaman,
as they were going forth unto the
judgment-seat, did stab Kishkumen
even to the heart, that he fell dead
without a groan. And he ran and
told Helaman all the things which
he had seen, and heard, and done.

10 And it came to pass that He-
laman did send forth to take this
band of robbers and “secret mur-
derers, that they might be executed
according to the law.

11 But behold, when Gadianton
had found that Kishkumen did not
return he feared lest that he should
be destroyed; therefore he caused
that his band should follow him.
And they took their flight out of

the land, by a secret way, into the
wilderness; and thus when Helaman
sent forth to take them they could
nowhere be found.

12 And more of this Gadianton
shall be spoken hereafter. And thus
ended the forty and second year
of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

13 And behold, in the end of this
book ye shall see that this *Gadian-
ton did prove the overthrow, yea,
almost the entire destruction of the
people of Nephi.

14 Behold I do not mean the end
of the “book of Helaman, but I
mean the end of the book of Nephi,
from which I have taken all the
account which I have written.

CHAPTER 3

Many Nephites migrate to the land
northward—They build houses of ce-
ment and keep many records—Tens
of thousands are converted and bap-
tized—The word of God leads men to
salvation—Nephi the son of Helaman
fills the judgment seat. About 49-39 B.c.

AND now it came to pass in the forty
and third year of the reign of the
judges, there was no contention
among the people of Nephi save
it were a little pride which was in
the church, which did cause some
little dissensions among the people,
which affairs were settled in the
ending of the forty and third year.

2 And there was no contention
among the people in the forty
and fourth year; neither was there
much contention in the forty and
fifth year.

3 And it came to pass in the forty
and sixth, yea, there was much con-
tention and many dissensions; in the
which there were an exceedingly
great many who departed out of
the land of Zarahemla, and went

 

372

forth unto the land “northward to
inherit the land.

4 And they did travel to an ex-
ceedingly great distance, insomuch
that they came to “large bodies of
water and many rivers.

5 Yea, and even they did spread
forth into all parts of the land,
into whatever parts it had not been
rendered desolate and without tim-
ber, because of the many inhabi-
tants who had before inherited the
land.

6 And now no part of the land was
desolate, save it were for timber;
but because of the greatness of the
“destruction of the people who had
before inhabited the land it was
called desolate.

7 And there being but little timber
upon the face of the land, never-
theless the people who went forth
became exceedingly “expert in the
working of cement; therefore they
did build houses of cement, in the
which they did dwell.

8 And it came to pass that they
did multiply and spread, and did
go forth from the land southward
to the land northward, and did
spread insomuch that they began
to cover the face of the whole earth,
from the sea south to the sea north,
from the “sea west to the sea east.

9 And the people who were in the
land northward did dwell in “tents,
and in houses of cement, and they
did suffer whatsoever tree should
spring up upon the face of the
land that it should grow up, that
in time they might have timber to
build their houses, yea, their cities,
and their temples, and their ’syna-
gogues, and their sanctuaries, and
all manner of their buildings.

10 And it came to pass as timber
was exceedingly scarce in the land
northward, they did send forth
much by the way of “shipping.

11 And thus they did enable the
people in the land northward that
they might build many cities, both
of wood and of cement.

12 And it came to pass that there
were many of the “people of Am-
mon, who were Lamanites by birth,
did also go forth into this land.

13 And now there are many
“records kept of the proceedings of
this people, by many of this people,
which are particular and very large,
concerning them.

14 But behold, a “hundredth part
of the proceedings of this people,
yea, the account of the Laman-
ites and of the Nephites, and their
wars, and contentions, and dissen-
sions, and their preaching, and
their prophecies, and their shipping
and their building of ships, and
their building of "temples, and of
synagogues and their ‘sanctuaries,
and their righteousness, and their
wickedness, and their murders, and
their robbings, and their plundering,
and all manner of abominations and
whoredoms, cannot be contained
in this work.

15 But behold, there are many
books and many “records of every
kind, and they have been kept
chiefly by the Nephites.

16 And they have been “handed
down from one generation to an-
other by the Nephites, even until
they have fallen into transgression
and have been murdered, plun-
dered, and hunted, and driven forth,
and slain, and "scattered upon the
face of the earth, and mixed with
the Lamanites until they are ‘no
more called the Nephites, becoming
wicked, and wild, and ferocious, yea,
even becoming Lamanites.

17 And now [return again to mine
account; therefore, what I have spo-
ken had passed after there had been

 

HELAMAN 3:11-24

great contentions, and disturbances,
and wars, and dissensions, among
the people of Nephi.

18 The forty and sixth year of the
reign of the judges ended;

19 And it came to pass that there
was still great contention in the
land, yea, even in the forty and
seventh year, and also in the forty
and eighth year.

20 Nevertheless “Helaman did fill
the judgment-seat with justice and
equity; yea, he did observe to keep
the statutes, and the judgments,
and the commandments of God; and
he did do that which was right in
the sight of God continually; and
he did walk after the ways of his
father, insomuch that he did pros-
per in the land.

21 And it came to pass that he had
two sons. He gave unto the eldest
the name of “Nephi, and unto the
youngest, the name of Lehi. And they
began to grow up unto the Lord.

22 And it came to pass that the
wars and contentions began to
cease, in a small degree, among
the people of the Nephites, in the
latter end of the forty and eighth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi.

23 And it came to pass in the forty
and ninth year of the reign of the
judges, there was continual peace
established in the land, all save it
were the “secret combinations which
’Gadianton the robber had estab-
lished in the more settled parts of
the land, which at that time were not
known unto those who were at the
head of government; therefore they
were not destroyed out of the land.

24 And it came to pass that in this
same year there was exceedingly
great prosperity in the church, in-
somuch that there were thousands
who did “join themselves unto the

church and were baptized unto
repentance.

25 And so great was the prosper-
ity of the church, and so many the
blessings which were poured out
upon the people, that even the high
priests and the teachers were them-
selves astonished beyond measure.

26 And it came to pass that the
work of the Lord did prosper unto
the baptizing and uniting to the
church of God, many souls, yea,
even tens of thousands.

27 Thus we may see that the Lord
is merciful unto all who will, in the
sincerity of their hearts, call upon
his holy name.

28 Yea, thus we see that the “gate
of heaven is open unto ’all, even to
those who will believe on the name
of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God.

29 Yea, we see that whosoever
will may lay hold upon the “word
of God, which is "quick and pow-
erful, which shall ‘divide asunder
all the cunning and the snares and
the wiles of the devil, and lead the
man of Christ in a strait and @nar-
row course across that everlasting
‘gulf of misery which is prepared
to engulf the wicked—

30 And land their souls, yea, their
immortal souls, at the “right hand
of God in the kingdom of heaven,
to sit down with Abraham, and
Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all
our holy fathers, to go no more out.

31 And in this year there was con-
tinual rejoicing in the land of Zara-
hemla, and in all the regions round
about, even in all the land which
was possessed by the Nephites.

32 And it came to pass that there
was peace and exceedingly great
joy in the remainder of the forty

 

374

and ninth year; yea, and also there
was continual peace and great joy
in the fiftieth year of the reign of
the judges.

33 And in the fifty and first year
of the reign of the judges there
was peace also, save it were the
pride which began to enter into the
church—not into the church of God,
but into the hearts of the people
who “professed to belong to the
church of God—

34 And they were lifted up in
“pride, even to the persecution of
many of their brethren. Now this
was a great evil, which did cause
the more humble part of the people
to suffer great persecutions, and to
wade through much affliction.

35 Nevertheless they did “fast and
’pray oft, and did wax stronger and
stronger in their “humility, and
firmer and firmer in the faith of
Christ, unto the filling their souls
with joy and consolation, yea, even
to the “purifying and the ‘sanctifi-
cation of their hearts, which sanc-
tification cometh because of their
fyielding their hearts unto God.

36 And it came to pass that the
fifty and second year ended in peace
also, save it were the exceedingly
great pride which had gotten into
the hearts of the people; and it was
because of their exceedingly great
“riches and their prosperity in the
land; and it did grow upon them
from day to day.

37 And it came to pass in the fifty
and third year of the reign of the
judges, *“Helaman died, and his el-
dest son "Nephi began to reign in
his stead. And it came to pass that
he did fill the judgment-seat with
justice and equity; yea, he did keep

the commandments of God, and

CHAPTER 4

Nephite dissenters and the Lamanites
join forces and take the land of Zara-
hemla—The Nephites’ defeats come be-
cause of their wickedness—The Church
dwindles, and the people become weak
like the Lamanites. About 38-30 B.c.

AND it came to pass in the fifty and
fourth year there were many dis-
sensions in the church, and there
was also a “contention among the
people, insomuch that there was
much bloodshed.

2 And the rebellious part were
slain and driven out of the land,
and they did go unto the king of
the Lamanites.

3 And it came to pass that they did
endeavor to stir up the Lamanites
to “war against the Nephites; but
behold, the Lamanites were °exceed-
ingly afraid, insomuch that they
would not hearken to the words of
those dissenters.

4 But it came to pass in the fifty
and sixth year of the reign of the
judges, there were “dissenters who
went up from the Nephites unto the
Lamanites; and they succeeded with
those others in ’stirring them up to
anger against the Nephites; and they
were all that year preparing for war.

5 And in the fifty and seventh
year they did come down against
the Nephites to battle, and they
did commence the work of death;
yea, insomuch that in the fifty and
eighth year of the reign of the judges
they succeeded in obtaining “pos-
session of the land of Zarahemla;
yea, and also all the lands, even unto
the land which was near the land
Bountiful.

6 And the Nephites and the armies

 

HELAMAN 4:1-12

of Moronihah were driven even into
the land of Bountiful;

7 And there they did fortify against
the Lamanites, from the west sea,
even unto the east; it being a “day’s
journey for a Nephite, on the line
which they had fortified and sta-
tioned their armies to defend their
north country.

8 And thus those “dissenters of
the Nephites, with the help of a
numerous army of the Lamanites,
had obtained all the possession of
the Nephites which was in the land
southward. And all this was done
in the fifty and eighth and ninth
years of the reign of the judges.

9 And it came to pass in the sixti-
eth year of the reign of the judges,
Moronihah did succeed with his
armies in obtaining many parts of
the land; yea, they regained many
cities which had fallen into the
hands of the Lamanites.

10 And it came to pass in the sixty
and first year of the reign of the
judges they succeeded in regaining
even the half of all their possessions.

11 Now this great loss of the Neph-
ites, and the great slaughter which
was among them, “would not have
happened had it not been for their
b’wickedness and their abomination
which was among them; yea, and it
was among those also who professed
to belong to the church of God.

12 And it was because of the “pride
of their hearts, because of their ex-
ceeding "riches, yea, it was because
of their oppression to the ‘poor,
withholding their food from the
hungry, withholding their clothing
from the naked, and smiting their
humble brethren upon the cheek,
making a ¢mock of that which
was sacred, denying the spirit of
prophecy and of revelation, mur-
dering, plundering, lying, stealing,

committing adultery, rising up in
great contentions, and deserting
away into the land of Nephi, among
the Lamanites—

13 And because of this their great
wickedness, and their “boastings
in their own strength, they were
left in their own strength; therefore
they did not prosper, but were
afflicted and smitten, and driven
before the Lamanites, until they
had lost possession of almost all
their lands.

14 But behold, Moronihah did
“preach many things unto the peo-
ple because of their iniquity, and
also "Nephi and Lehi, who were
the sons of Helaman, did preach
many things unto the people, yea,
and did prophesy many things unto
them concerning their iniquities,
and what should come unto them
if they did not repent of their sins.

15 And it came to pass that they
did repent, and inasmuch as they
did repent they did begin to prosper.

16 For when Moronihah saw that
they did repent he did venture to
“lead them forth from place to place,
and from city to city, even until
they had regained the one-half of
their property and the one-half
of all their lands.

17 And thus ended the sixty and
first year of the reign of the judges.

18 And it came to pass in the sixty
and second year of the reign of the
judges, that Moronihah could ob-
tain no more possessions over the
Lamanites.

19 Therefore they did abandon
their design to obtain the remain-
der of their lands, for so numerous
were the Lamanites that it became
impossible for the Nephites to ob-
tain more power over them; there-
fore Moronihah did employ all his

 

376

armies in maintaining those parts
which he had taken.

20 And it came to pass, because of
the greatness of the number of the
Lamanites the Nephites were in great
fear, lest they should be overpow-
ered, and trodden down, and slain,
and destroyed.

21 Yea, they began to remember
the “prophecies of Alma, and also the
words of Mosiah; and they saw that
they had been a‘stiffnecked people,
and that they had set at ‘naught the
commandments of God;

22 And that they had altered and
trampled under their feet the “laws
of Mosiah, or that which the Lord
commanded him to give unto the
people; and they saw that their laws
had become corrupted, and that
they had become a wicked people,
insomuch that they were wicked
even like unto the Lamanites.

23 And because of their iniquity
the church had begun to “dwindle;
and they began to disbelieve in the
spirit of prophecy and in the spirit
of revelation; and the judgments of
God did stare them in the face.

24 And they saw that they had be-
come “weak, like unto their brethren,
the Lamanites, and that the Spirit of
the Lord did no more preserve them;
yea, it had withdrawn from them
because the Spirit of the Lord doth
not dwell in ‘unholy “temples—

25 Therefore the Lord did cease to
preserve them by his miraculous and
matchless power, for they had fallen
into a state of “unbelief and awful
wickedness; and they saw that the
Lamanites were exceedingly more
numerous than they, and except they
should ’cleave unto the Lord their
God they must unavoidably perish.

26 For behold, they saw that the
strength of the Lamanites was as

great as their strength, even man for
man. And thus had they fallen into
this great transgression; yea, thus
had they become “weak, because
of their transgression, in the space of
’not many years.

CHAPTER 5

Nephi and Lehi devote themselves to
preaching—Their names invite them to
pattern their lives after their forebears—
Christ redeems those who repent—
Nephi and Lehi make many converts
and are imprisoned, and fire encircles
them—A cloud of darkness overshad-
ows three hundred people—The earth
shakes, and a voice commands men to
repent—Nephi and Lehi converse with
angels, and the multitude is encircled
by fire. About 30 B.C.

AND it came to pass that in this same
year, behold, “Nephi ’delivered up
the judgment-seat to a man whose
name was °Cezoram.

2 For as their laws and their gov-
ernments were established by the
*voice of the people, and they who
’chose evil were ‘more numerous
than they who chose good, therefore
they were “ripening for destruction,
for the laws had become corrupted.

3 Yea, and this was not all; they
were a “stiffnecked people, inso-
much that they could not be gov-
erned by the law nor justice, save
it were to their destruction.

4 And it came to pass that Nephi
had become weary because of their
iniquity; and he yielded up the
judgment-seat, and took it upon
him to preach the word of God all
the remainder of his days, and his
brother Lehi also, all the remain-
der of his days;

 

HELAMAN 5:1-9

5 For they remembered the words
which their “father Helaman spake
unto them. And these are the words
which he spake:

6 Behold, my sons, I desire that
ye should remember to keep the
commandments of God; and I
would that ye should declare unto
the people these words. Behold, I
have given unto you the names of
our first “parents who came out
of the land of Jerusalem; and this
Ihave done that when you remem-
ber your names ye may remember
them; and when ye remember them
ye may remember their works; and
when ye remember their works ye
may know how that it is said, and
also written, that they were °good.

7 Therefore, my sons, I would that
ye should do that which is good,
that it may be said of you, and also
written, even as it has been said and
written of them.

8 And now my sons, behold I have
somewhat more to desire of you,
which desire is, that ye may not
do these things that ye may boast,
but that ye may do these things to
lay up for yourselves a “treasure in
heaven, yea, which is eternal, and
which fadeth not away; yea, that
ye may have that ’precious gift of
eternal life, which we have reason
to suppose hath been given to our

10 And remember also the words
which Amulek spake unto Zeez-
rom, “in the city of Ammonihah;
for he said unto him that the Lord
surely should come to redeem his
people, but that he should not come
to redeem them in their sins, but to
redeem them from their sins.

11 And he hath power given unto
him from the Father to redeem
them from their sins because of re-
pentance; therefore he hath “sent
his angels to declare the tidings
of the conditions of repentance,
which bringeth unto the power of
the Redeemer, unto the salvation of
their souls.

12 And now, my sons, remember,
remember that it is upon the “rock
of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the
Son of God, that ye must build your
’foundation; that when the devil
shall send forth his mighty winds,
yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea,
when all his hail and his mighty
‘storm shall beat upon you, it shall
have no power over you to drag you
down to the gulf of misery and end-
less wo, because of the rock upon
which ye are built, which is a sure
foundation, a foundation whereon
if men build they cannot fall.

13 And it came to pass that these
were the words which Helaman
*taught to his sons; yea, he did
teach them many things which are
not written, and also many things
which are written.

14 And they did remember his
words; and therefore they went
forth, keeping the commandments
of God, to teach the word of God
among all the people of Nephi, be-
ginning at the city Bountiful;

15 And from thenceforth to the

 

378

city of Gid; and from the city of
Gid to the city of Mulek;

16 And even from one city to an-
other, until they had gone forth
“among all the people of Nephi
who were in the land southward;
and from thence into the land of
Zarahemla, among the Lamanites.

17 And it came to pass that they
did “preach with great "power, inso-
much that they did confound many
of those ‘dissenters who had gone
over from the Nephites, insomuch
that they came forth and did con-
fess their sins and were baptized
unto repentance, and immediately
returned to the Nephites to endeavor
to repair unto them the wrongs
which they had done.

18 And it came to pass that Nephi
and Lehi did preach unto the Laman-
ites with such great power and author-
ity, for they had power and authority
given unto them that they might
“speak, and they also had what they
should speak given unto them—

19 Therefore they did speak unto
the great astonishment of the La-
manites, to the convincing them,
insomuch that there were eight thou-
sand of the Lamanites who were in
the land of Zarahemla and round
about “baptized unto repentance,
and were convinced of the ’wick-
edness of the ‘traditions of their
fathers.

20 And it came to pass that Nephi
and Lehi did proceed from thence
to go to the “land of Nephi.

21 And it came to pass that they
were taken by an army of the La-
manites and cast into “prison; yea,
even in that same prison in which
Ammon and his brethren were cast
by the servants of Limhi.

22 And after they had been cast
into prison many days without
food, behold, they went forth into
the prison to take them that they
might slay them.

23 And it came to pass that Nephi
and Lehi were encircled about “as
if by °fire, even insomuch that they
durst not lay their hands upon them
for fear lest they should be burned.
Nevertheless, Nephi and Lehi were
not burned; and they were as stand-
ing in the midst of fire and were
not burned.

24 And when they saw that they
were encircled about with a “pillar
of fire, and that it burned them not,
their hearts did take courage.

25 For they saw that the Laman-
ites durst not lay their hands upon
them; neither durst they come near
unto them, but stood as if they were
struck dumb with amazement.

26 And it came to pass that Nephi
and Lehi did stand forth and began
to speak unto them, saying: “Fear
not, for behold, it is God that has
shown unto you this marvelous
thing, in the which is shown unto
you that ye cannot lay your hands
on us to slay us.

27 And behold, when they had
said these words, the earth shook
exceedingly, and the walls of the
prison did shake as if they were
about to tumble to the earth; but
behold, they did not fall. And be-
hold, they that were in the prison
were Lamanites and Nephites who
were dissenters.

28 And it came to pass that they
were overshadowed with a cloud
of “darkness, and an awful solemn
fear came upon them.

29 And it came to pass that there
came a “voice as if it were above the
cloud of darkness, saying: Repent ye,

 

HELAMAN 5:22-36

repent ye, and seek no more to de-
stroy my "servants whom I have sent
unto you to declare good tidings.

30 And it came to pass when they
heard this ¢voice, and beheld that
it was not a voice of thunder, nei-
ther was it a voice of a great tu-
multuous noise, but behold, it was
a ’still voice of perfect mildness,
as if it had been a whisper, and it
did pierce even to the very soul—

31 And notwithstanding the mild-
ness of the voice, behold the earth
shook exceedingly, and the walls of
the prison trembled again, as if it
were about to tumble to the earth;
and behold the cloud of darkness,
which had overshadowed them, did
not disperse—

32 And behold the voice came
again, saying: *Repent ye, repent
ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at
hand; and seek no more to destroy
my servants. And it came to pass
that the earth shook again, and the
walls trembled.

33 And also again the third time the
voice came, and did speak unto them
marvelous words which “cannot be
uttered by man; and the walls did
tremble again, and the earth shook
as if it were about to divide asunder.

34 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites could not flee because
of the cloud of darkness which did
overshadow them; yea, and also they
were immovable because of the fear
which did come upon them.

35 Now there was one among them
who was a Nephite by birth, who
had once belonged to the church of
God but had dissented from them.

36 And it came to pass that he
turned him about, and behold, he
saw through the cloud of darkness
the faces of Nephi and Lehi; and be-
hold, they did “shine exceedingly,

even as the faces of angels. And
he beheld that they did lift their
eyes to heaven; and they were in
the attitude as if talking or lifting
their voices to some being whom
they beheld.

37 And it came to pass that this
man did cry unto the multitude,
that they might turn and look. And
behold, there was power given unto
them that they did turn and look;
and they did behold the faces of
Nephi and Lehi.

38 And they said unto the man:
Behold, what do all these things
mean, and who is it with whom
these men do converse?

39 Now the man’s name was
Aminadab. And Aminadab said
unto them: They do converse with
the angels of God.

40 And it came to pass that the La-
manites said unto him: “What shall
we do, that this cloud of darkness
may be removed from overshad-
owing us?

41 And Aminadab said unto them:
You must “repent, and cry unto the
voice, even until ye shall have *faith
in Christ, who was taught unto you
by Alma, and ‘Amulek, and Zeez-
rom; and when ye shall do this, the
cloud of darkness shall be removed
from overshadowing you.

42 And it came to pass that they
all did begin to cry unto the voice
of him who had shaken the earth;
yea, they did cry even until the
cloud of darkness was dispersed.

43 And it came to pass that when
they cast their eyes about, and saw
that the cloud of darkness was dis-
persed from overshadowing them,
behold, they saw that they were
“encircled about, yea every soul,
by a pillar of fire.

44 And “Nephi and °Lehi were in
the midst of them; yea, they were
encircled about; yea, they were as

 

380

if in the midst of a flaming fire, yet
it did harm them not, neither did
it take hold upon the walls of the
prison; and they were filled with
that ‘joy which is unspeakable and
full of glory.

45 And behold, the “Holy Spirit of
God did come down from heaven,
and did enter into their hearts, and
they were filled as if with fire,
and they could ’speak forth mar-
velous words.

46 And it came to pass that there
came a voice unto them, yea, a
pleasant voice, as if it were a whis-
per, saying:

47 “Peace, peace be unto you, be-
cause of your faith in my Well Be-
loved, who was from the foundation
of the world.

48 And now, when they heard this
they cast up their eyes as if to be-
hold from whence the voice came;
and behold, they saw the “heavens
open; and angels came down out
of heaven and ministered unto
them.

49 And there were about three
hundred souls who saw and heard
these things; and they were bidden
to go forth and marvel not, neither
should they doubt.

50 And it came to pass that they
did go forth, and did minister unto
the people, declaring throughout
all the regions round about all the
things which they had heard and
seen, insomuch that the more part
of the Lamanites were “convinced
of them, because of the great-
ness of the evidences which they
had received.

51 And as many as were “convinced
did lay down their weapons of
war, and also their hatred and the
tradition of their fathers.

52 And it came to pass that they
did “yield up unto the Nephites the
lands of their possession.

CHAPTER 6

The righteous Lamanites preach to the
wicked Nephites—Both peoples prosper
during an era of peace and plenty—
Lucifer, the author of sin, stirs up the
hearts of the wicked and the Gadianton
robbers in murder and wickedness—T he
robbers take over the Nephite govern-
ment. About 29-23 B.C.

AND it came to pass that when the
sixty and second year of the reign
of the judges had ended, all these
things had happened and the La-
manites had become, the more part
of them, a righteous people, inso-
much that their “righteousness did
exceed that of the Nephites, because
of their firmness and their steadi-
ness in the faith.

2 For behold, there were many of
the Nephites who had become ¢hard-
ened and impenitent and grossly
wicked, insomuch that they did
reject the word of God and all the
preaching and prophesying which
did come among them.

3 Nevertheless, the people of the
church did have great joy because
of the conversion of the Laman-
ites, yea, because of the church of
God, which had been established
among them. And they did “fellow-
ship one with another, and did re-
joice one with another, and did have
great joy.

4 And it came to pass that many
of the Lamanites did come down
into the land of Zarahemla, and
did declare unto the people of the
Nephites the manner of their ¢con-
version, and did exhort them to
faith and repentance.

5 Yea, and many did “preach with
exceedingly great power and author-
ity, unto the bringing down many

 

HELAMAN 6:1-12

of them into the depths of humil-
ity, to be the humble followers of
God and the Lamb.

6 And it came to pass that many of
the Lamanites did go into the land
northward; and also *Nephi and
’Lehi went into the ‘land northward,
to preach unto the people. And thus
ended the sixty and third year.

7 And behold, there was peace in
all the land, insomuch that the Neph-
ites did go into whatsoever part of
the land they would, whether among
the Nephites or the Lamanites.

8 And it came to pass that the La-
manites did also go whithersoever
they would, whether it were among
the Lamanites or among the Neph-
ites; and thus they did have free
intercourse one with another, to
“buy and to sell, and to get gain,
according to their desire.

9 And it came to pass that they
became exceedingly rich, both the
Lamanites and the Nephites; and
they did have an exceeding plenty
of “gold, and of silver, and of all
manner of precious metals, both in
the land south and in the land north.

10 Now the land south was called
“Lehi, and the land north was called
’Mulek, which was after the ‘son of
Zedekiah; for the Lord did bring
Mulek into the land north, and Lehi
into the land south.

11 And behold, there was all man-
ner of gold in both these lands, and
of silver, and of precious ore of ev-
ery kind; and there were also cu-
rious workmen, who did “work all
kinds of ore and did refine it; and
thus they did become rich.

12 They did raise grain in abun-
dance, both in the north and in the
south; and they did flourish exceed-
ingly, both in the north and in the

south. And they did multiply and
wax exceedingly strong in the land.
And they did raise many flocks and
herds, yea, many fatlings.

13 Behold their women did toil
and spin, and did ¢make all manner
of ’cloth, of fine-twined linen and
cloth of every kind, to clothe their
nakedness. And thus the sixty and
fourth year did pass away in peace.

14 And in the sixty and fifth year
they did also have great joy and peace,
yea, much preaching and many
prophecies concerning that which
was to come. And thus passed away
the sixty and fifth year.

15 And it came to pass that in the
sixty and sixth year of the reign of
the judges, behold, “Cezoram was
murdered by an unknown hand as
he sat upon the judgment-seat. And
it came to pass that in the same
year, that his son, who had been ap-
pointed by the people in his stead,
was also murdered. And thus ended
the sixty and sixth year.

16 And in the commencement
of the sixty and seventh year the
people began to grow exceedingly
wicked again.

17 For behold, the Lord had blessed
them so long with the “riches of
the world that they had not been
stirred up to anger, to wars, nor to
bloodshed; therefore they began to
set their hearts upon their riches;
yea, they began to seek to get gain
that they might be lifted up one
above another; therefore they began
to commit "secret murders, and to
rob and to plunder, that they might
get gain.

18 And now behold, those murder-
ers and plunderers were a band who
had been formed by Kishkumen and
*Gadianton. And now it had come
to pass that there were many, even
among the Nephites, of Gadianton’s

 

382

band. But behold, they were more
numerous among the more wicked
part of the Lamanites. And they
were called Gadianton’s robbers and
murderers,

19 And it was they who did mur-
der the chief judge “Cezoram, and
his son, while in the judgment-seat;
and behold, they were not found.

20 And now it came to pass that
when the Lamanites found that
there were robbers among them they
were exceedingly sorrowful; and
they did use every means in their
power to destroy them off the face
of the earth.

21 But behold, Satan did stir up
the “hearts of the more part of the
Nephites, insomuch that they did
unite with those bands of robbers,
and did enter into their covenants
and their oaths, that they would
protect and preserve one another in
whatsoever difficult circumstances
they should be placed, that they
should not suffer for their murders,
and their plunderings, and their
’stealings.

22 And it came to pass that they
did have their signs, yea, their “se-
cret signs, and their "secret words;
and this that they might distinguish
a brother who had entered into the
covenant, that whatsoever wicked-
ness his brother should do he should
not be injured by his brother, nor by
those who did belong to his band,
who had taken this covenant.

23 And thus they might murder,
and plunder, and steal, and commit
*4whoredoms and all manner of
wickedness, contrary to the laws
of their country and also the laws of
their God.

24 And whosoever of those who be-
longed to their band should reveal
unto the world of their “wickedness
and their abominations, should be

tried, not according to the laws of
their country, but according to the
laws of their wickedness, which
had been given by Gadianton and
Kishkumen.

25 Now behold, it is these secret
“oaths and covenants which Alma
commanded his son should not
go forth unto the world, lest they
should be a means of bringing down
the people unto destruction.

26 Now behold, those “secret oaths
and covenants did not come forth
unto Gadianton from the *records
which were delivered unto Helaman;
but behold, they were put into the
heart of ‘Gadianton by that “same be-
ing who did entice our first parents
to partake of the forbidden fruit—

27 Yea, that same being who did
plot with ¢Cain, that if he would
murder his brother Abel it should
not be known unto the world. And
he did plot with Cain and his fol-
lowers from that time forth.

28 And also it is that same being
who put it into the hearts of the
people to “build a tower sufficiently
high that they might get to heaven.
And it was that same being who led
on the people who came from that
tower into this land; who spread
the works of darkness and abomi-
nations over all the face of the land,
until he dragged the people down
to an ’entire destruction, and toan
everlasting hell.

29 Yea, it is that same being who
put it into the heart of “Gadianton
to still carry on the work of dark-
ness, and of secret murder; and he
has brought it forth from the begin-
ning of man even down to this time.

30 And behold, it is he who is the
“author of all sin, And behold, he
doth carry on his works of darkness

 

HELAMAN 6:25-36

and secret murder, and doth hand
down their plots, and their oaths,
and their covenants, and their plans
of awful wickedness, from genera-
tion to generation according as he
can get hold upon the hearts of the
children of men.

31 And now behold, he had got
great hold upon the hearts of the
Nephites; yea, insomuch that they
had become exceedingly wicked; yea,
the more part of them had turned
out of the *way of righteousness,
and did *trample under their feet
the commandments of God, and did
turn unto their own ways, and
did build up unto themselves ‘idols
of their gold and their silver.

32 And it came to pass that all
these iniquities did come unto them
in the space of *not many years,
insomuch that a more part of it had
come unto them in the sixty and
seventh year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi.

33 And they did grow in their in-
iquities in the sixty and eighth year
also, to the great sorrow and lam-
entation of the righteous.

34 And thus we see that the “Neph-
ites did begin to dwindle in unbe-
lief, and grow in wickedness and
abominations, while the Lamanites
began to grow exceedingly in the
knowledge of their God; yea, they
did begin to keep his statutes and
commandments, and to walk in
truth and uprightness before him.

35 And thus we see that the Spirit
of the Lord began to “withdraw
from the Nephites, because of the
wickedness and the hardness of
their hearts.

36 And thus we see that the Lord
began to pour out his “Spirit upon
the Lamanites, because of their

easiness and willingness to believe
in his words.

37 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites did hunt the band of
robbers of Gadianton; and they
did preach the word of God among
the more wicked part of them, in-
somuch that this band of robbers
was utterly destroyed from among
the Lamanites.

38 And it came to pass on the
other hand, that the Nephites did
build them up and support them,
beginning at the more wicked part
of them, until they had overspread
all the land of the Nephites, and
had seduced the more part of the
righteous until they had come down
to believe in their works and par-
take of their spoils, and to join with
them in their secret murders and
combinations.

39 And thus they did obtain the
sole management of the govern-
ment, insomuch that they did tram-
ple under their feet and smite and
rend and turn their backs upon the
“poor and the meek, and the hum-
ble followers of God.

40 And thus we see that they were
in an awful state, and “ripening for
an everlasting destruction.

41 And it came to pass that thus
ended the sixty and eighth year
of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

THE PROPHECY OF NEPHI, THE SON OF
HELAMAN—God threatens the people
of Nephi that he will visit them in
his anger, to their utter destruction
except they repent of their wick-
edness. God smiteth the people of
Nephi with pestilence; they repent
and turn unto him. Samuel, a Laman-
ite, prophesies unto the Nephites.

Comprising chapters 7 through 16.

CHAPTER 7

Nephi is rejected in the north and returns
to Zarahemla—He prays upon his gar-
den tower and then calls upon the people
to repent or perish. About 23-21 B.c.

BEHOLD, now it came to pass in the
sixty and ninth year of the reign of
the judges over the people of the
Nephites, that Nephi, the son of
Helaman, “returned to the land of
Zarahemla from the land northward.

2 For he had been forth among the
people who were in the land north-
ward, and did preach the word of
God unto them, and did prophesy
many things unto them;

3 And they did “reject all his words,
insomuch that he could not stay
among them, but returned again
unto the land of his nativity.

4 And seeing the people ina state
of such awful wickedness, and
those Gadianton robbers filling the
judgment-seats—having “usurped
the power and authority of the land;
laying aside the commandments
of God, and not in the least aright
before him; doing no justice unto
the children of men;

5 Condemning the righteous be-
cause of their righteousness; letting
the guilty and the wicked go “un-
punished because of their "money;
and moreover to be held in office
at the head of government, to rule
and do according to their wills,
that they might get gain and glory
of the ‘world, and, moreover, that
they might the more easily commit
adultery, and steal, and kill, and
do according to their own wills—

6 Now this great iniquity had come
upon the Nephites, in the space of
“not many years; and when Nephi
saw it, his heart was swollen with
sorrow within his breast; and he did
exclaim in the agony of his soul:

7 Oh, that I could have had my
days in the days when my father
Nephi first came out of the land of
Jerusalem, that I could have “joyed
with him in the promised land; then
were his people easy to be entreated,
‘firm to keep the commandments
of God, and slow to be led to do iniq-
uity; and they were quick to hearken
unto the words of the Lord—

8 Yea, if my days could have been
in those days, then would my soul
have had joy in the righteousness
of my brethren.

9 But behold, I am consigned that
these are my days, and that my soul
shall be filled with “sorrow because of
this the wickedness of my brethren.

10 And behold, now it came to pass
that it was upon a tower, which was
in the “garden of Nephi, which
was by the highway which led to
the chief market, which was in the
city of Zarahemla; therefore, Nephi
had bowed himself upon the tower
which was in his garden, which
tower was also near unto the garden
gate by which led the highway.

11 And it came to pass that there
were certain men passing by and
saw Nephi as he was pouring out his
soul unto God upon the “tower; and
they ran and told the people what
they had seen, and the people came
together in multitudes that they
might know the cause of so great
mourning for the wickedness of
the people.

12 And now, when Nephi arose he
beheld the multitudes of people
who had gathered together.

13 And it came to pass that he
opened his mouth and said unto
them: Behold, ¢why have ye gath-
ered yourselves together? That I
may tell you of your iniquities?

 

HELAMAN 7:7-22

14 Yea, because I have got upon
my tower that I might pour out
my soul unto my God, because of
the exceeding sorrow of my heart,
which is because of your iniquities!

15 And because of my “mourning
and lamentation ye have gathered
yourselves together, and do mar-
vel; yea, and ye have great need
to marvel; yea, ye ought to marvel
because ye are given away that the
devil has got so great hold upon
your hearts.

16 Yea, how could you have given
way to the enticing of him who
is seeking to hurl away your souls
down to “everlasting misery and
endless wo?

17 O repent ye, repent ye! “Why
will ye die? Turn ye, turn ye unto
the Lord your God. Why has he
forsaken you?

18 It is because you have hard-
ened your hearts; yea, ye will not
“hearken unto the voice of the good
shepherd; yea, ye have ‘provoked
him to anger against you.

19 And behold, instead of “gath-
ering you, except ye will repent,
behold, he shall scatter you forth
that ye shall become meat for dogs
and wild beasts.

20 O, how could you have “forgot-
ten your God in the very day that
he has delivered you?

21 But behold, it is to get “gain, to
be "praised of men, yea, and that
ye might get gold and silver. And
ye have set your hearts upon the
‘riches and the vain things of this
world, for the which ye do murder,
and plunder, and steal, and bear
“false witness against your neigh-
bor, and do all manner of iniquity.

22 And for this cause “wo shall come
unto you except ye shall repent.

For if ye will not repent, behold,
this 'great city, and also all those
great cities which are round about,
which are in the land of our pos-
session, shall be taken away that
ye shall have no place in them; for
behold, the Lord will not grant unto
you ‘strength, as he has hitherto
done, to withstand against your
enemies.

23 For behold, thus saith the Lord:
I will not show unto the wicked of
my strength, to one more than the
other, save it be unto those who
repent of their sins, and hearken
unto my words. Now therefore, I
would that ye should behold, my
brethren, that it shall be “better for
the Lamanites than for you except
ye shall repent.

24 For behold, they are more righ-
teous than you, for they have not
sinned against that great knowledge
which ye have received; therefore
the Lord will be merciful unto them;
yea, he will “lengthen out their days
and increase their seed, even when
thou shalt be utterly "destroyed ex-
cept thou shalt repent.

25 Yea, wo be unto you because
of that great abomination which
has come among you; and ye have
united yourselves unto it, yea, to
that ¢secret band which was estab-
lished by Gadianton!

26 Yea, “wo shall come unto you
because of that pride which ye have
suffered to enter your hearts, which
has lifted you up beyond that which
is good because of your exceedingly
great riches!

27 Yea, wo be unto you because of
your wickedness and abominations!

28 And except ye repent ye shall
perish; yea, even your lands shall
be taken from you, and ye shall be
destroyed from off the face of the
earth.

29 Behold now, I do not say that

 

386

these things shall be, of myself,
because it is not of myself that
I ¢know these things; but behold, I
’know that these things are true be-
cause the Lord God has made them
known unto me, therefore I testify
that they shall be.

CHAPTER 8

Corrupt judges seek to incite the peo-
ple against Nephi—Abraham, Moses,
Zenos, Zenock, Evias, Isaiah, Jere-
miah, Lehi, and Nephi all testified
of Christ—By inspiration Nephi an-
nounces the murder of the chief judge.
About 23-21 B.c.

AND now it came to pass that when
Nephi had said these words, behold,
there were men who were judges,
who also belonged to the secret
band of Gadianton, and they were
angry, and they cried out against
him, saying unto the people: Why
do ye not seize upon this man and
bring him forth, that he may be
condemned according to the crime
which he has done?

2 Why seest thou this man, and
hearest him revile against this peo-
ple and against our law?

3 For behold, Nephi had spoken
unto them concerning the corrupt-
ness of their law; yea, many things
did Nephi speak which cannot be
written; and nothing did he speak
which was contrary to the com-
mandments of God.

4 And those judges were angry
with him because he “spake plainly
unto them concerning their secret
works of darkness; nevertheless,
they durst not lay their own hands
upon him, for they feared the peo-
ple lest they should cry out against
them.

5 Therefore they did cry unto the
people, saying: Why do you suffer
this man to revile against us? For

behold he doth condemn all this
people, even unto destruction; yea,
and also that these our “great cit-
ies shall be taken from us, that we
shall have no place in them.

6 And now we know that this is
impossible, for behold, we are “pow-
erful, and our cities great, therefore
our enemies can have no power
over us.

7 And it came to pass that thus
they did “stir up the people to anger
against Nephi, and raised conten-
tions among them; for there were
some who did cry out: "Let this man
alone, for he is a good man, and
those things which he saith will
surely come to pass except we repent;

8 Yea, behold, all the judgments
will come upon us which he has
testified unto us; for we know that
he has testified aright unto us con-
cerning our iniquities. And behold
they are many, and he “knoweth as
well all things which shall befall
us as he knoweth of our iniquities;

9 Yea, and behold, if he had not
been a prophet he could not have
“testified concerning those things.

10 And it came to pass that those
people who sought to destroy Nephi
were compelled because of their fear,
that they did not lay their hands
on him; therefore he began again
to speak unto them, seeing that
he had gained favor in the eyes of
some, insomuch that the remainder
of them did fear.

11 Therefore he was constrained
to speak more unto them saying:
Behold, my brethren, have ye not
read that God gave power unto one
man, even Moses, to smite upon the
waters of the “Red Sea, and they
parted hither and thither, insomuch

 

HELAMAN 8:6-18

that the Israelites, who were our
fathers, came through upon dry
ground, and the waters closed upon
the armies of the Egyptians and
swallowed them up?

12 And now behold, if God gave
unto this man such power, then
why should ye dispute among your-
selves, and say that he hath given
unto me no power whereby I may
*know concerning the judgments
that shall come upon you except
ye repent?

13 But, behold, ye not only deny
my words, but ye also deny all the
words which have been spoken
by our fathers, and also the words
which were spoken by this man,
Moses, who had such great power
given unto him, yea, the words
which he hath spoken concerning
the coming of the Messiah.

14 Yea, did he not bear record that
the Son of God should come? And
as he “lifted up the brazen serpent
in the wilderness, even so shall he
be lifted up who should come.

15 And as many as should look
upon that serpent should “live, even
so as many as should look upon the
Son of God with faith, having a con-
trite spirit, might live, even unto
that life which is eternal.

16 And now behold, Moses did
not only testify of these things, but
also “all the holy prophets, from his
days even to the days of Abraham.

17 Yea, and behold, “Abraham saw
of his coming, and was filled with
gladness and did rejoice.

18 Yea, and behold I say unto you,
that Abraham not only knew of
these things, but there were “many
before the days of Abraham who
were called by the order of God;

yea, even after the order of his Son;
and this that it should be shown
unto the people, a great many
thousand years before his coming,
that even redemption should come
unto them.

19 And now I would that ye should
know, that even since the days of
Abraham there have been many
prophets that have testified these
things; yea, behold, the prophet
*Zenos did testify boldly; for the
which he was slain.

20 And behold, also *Zenock, and
also °Ezias, and also ‘Isaiah, and
“Jeremiah, (Jeremiah being that
same prophet who testified of the
destruction of “‘Jerusalem) and
now we Know that Jerusalem was
destroyed according to the words
of Jeremiah. O then why not the
Son of God come, according to his
prophecy?

21 And now will you dispute that
4Jerusalem was destroyed? Will ye
say that the "sons of Zedekiah were
not slain, all except it were “Mulek?
Yea, and do ye not behold that the
seed of Zedekiah are with us, and
they were driven out of the land
of Jerusalem? But behold, this is
not all—

22 Our father Lehi was driven
out of Jerusalem because he “tes-
tified of these things. Nephi also
testified of these things, and also
almost all of our fathers, even down
to this time; yea, they have testified
of the "coming of Christ, and have
looked forward, and have rejoiced
in his day which is to come.

23 And behold, he is God, and he

 

388

is ¢with them, and he did manifest
himself unto them, that they were
redeemed by him; and they gave
unto him glory, because of that
which is to come.

24 And now, seeing ye know these
things and cannot deny them ex-
cept ye shall lie, therefore in this
ye have sinned, for ye have rejected
all these things, notwithstanding
so many “evidences which ye have
received; yea, even ye have received
ball things, both things in heaven,
and all things which are in the
earth, as a witness that they are
true.

25 But behold, ye have rejected the
truth, and “rebelled against your
holy God; and even at this time,
instead of laying up for yourselves
’treasures in heaven, where nothing
doth corrupt, and where nothing can
come which is unclean, ye are heap-
ing up for yourselves wrath against
the day of ‘judgment.

26 Yea, even at this time ye are
ripening, because of your murders
and your “fornication and wicked-
ness, for everlasting destruction;
yea, and except ye repent it will
come unto you soon.

27 Yea, behold it is now even at
your doors; yea, go ye in unto the
judgment-seat, and search; and be-
hold, your judge is murdered, and
he “lieth in his blood; and he hath
been murdered "by his brother, who
seeketh to sit in the judgment-seat.

28 And behold, they both belong
to your secret band, whose “author
is Gadianton and the evil one who
seeketh to destroy the souls of men.

CHAPTER 9

Messengers find the chief judge dead
at the judgment seat—They are impris-
oned and later released—By inspiration
Nephi identifies Seantum as the mur-
derer—Nephi is accepted by some as a
prophet. About 23-21 B.c.

BEHOLD, now it came to pass that
when Nephi had spoken these
words, certain men who were among
them ran to the judgment-seat; yea,
even there were “five who went,
and they said among themselves, as
they went:

2 Behold, now we will know of a
surety whether this man be a prophet
and God hath commanded him to
prophesy such marvelous things
unto us. Behold, we do not “believe
that he hath; yea, we do not believe
that he is a prophet; nevertheless,
if this thing which he has said con-
cerning the chief judge be true, that
he be dead, then will we believe
that the other words which he has
spoken are true.

3 And it came to pass that they ran
in their might, and came in unto
the judgment-seat; and behold, the
chief judge had fallen to the earth,
and did “lie in his blood.

4 And now behold, when they saw
this they were astonished exceed-
ingly, insomuch that they fell to
the earth; for they had not believed
the words which Nephi had spoken
concerning the chief judge.

5 But now, when they saw they
believed, and fear came upon them
lest all the judgments which Nephi
had spoken “should come upon the
people; therefore they did quake,
and had fallen to the earth.

6 Now, immediately when the
judge had been murdered—he being
stabbed by his brother by a garb of
secrecy, and he fled, and the servants
ran and told the people, raising the
cry of murder among them;

7 And behold the people did gather

 

HELAMAN 9:1-14

themselves together unto the place
of the judgment-seat—and behold,
to their astonishment they saw
those “five men who had fallen to
the earth.

8 And now behold, the people
knew nothing concerning the mul-
titude who had gathered together
at the “garden of Nephi; therefore
they said among themselves: These
men are they who have murdered
the judge, and God has smitten them
that they could not flee from us.

9 And it came to pass that they laid
hold on them, and bound them and
cast them into prison. And there
was a proclamation sent abroad
that the judge was slain, and that
the murderers had been taken and
were cast into prison.

10 And it came to pass that on the
morrow the people did assemble
themselves together to “mourn and
to ’fast, at the burial of the great
chief judge who had been slain.

11 And thus also those judges who
were at the garden of Nephi, and
heard his words, were also gathered
together at the burial.

12 And it came to pass that they
inquired among the people, saying:
Where are the five who were sent to
inquire concerning the chief judge
whether he was dead? And they an-
swered and said: Concerning this
five whom ye say ye have sent, we
know not; but there are five who are
the murderers, whom we have cast
into prison.

13 And it came to pass that the
judges desired that they should be
brought; and they were brought,
and behold they were the five who
were sent; and behold the judges in-
quired of them to know concerning
the matter, and they told them all
that they had done, saying:

14 We ran and came to the place
of the judgment-seat, and when
we saw all things even as Nephi
had testified, we were astonished

insomuch that we fell to the earth;
and when we were recovered from
our astonishment, behold they cast
us into “prison.

15 Now, as for the murder of this
man, we know not who has done
it; and only this much we Know,
we ran and came “according as ye
desired, and behold he was dead,
according to the words of Nephi.

16 And now it came to pass that
the judges did expound the matter
unto the people, and did cry out
against Nephi, saying: Behold, we
know that this Nephi must have
agreed with some one to slay the
judge, and then he might declare
it unto us, that he might convert us
unto his faith, that he might raise
himself to be a great man, chosen
of God, and a prophet.

17 And now behold, we will detect
this man, and he shall confess his
fault and make known unto us the
true murderer of this judge.

18 And it came to pass that the
five were liberated on the day of
the burial. Nevertheless, they did
rebuke the judges in the words
which they had spoken against
Nephi, and did contend with them
one by one, insomuch that they did
confound them.

19 Nevertheless, they caused that
Nephi should be taken and bound
and brought before the multitude,
and they began to question him in
divers ways that they might cross
him, that they might accuse him
to death—

20 Saying unto him: Thou art con-
federate; who is this man that hath
done this murder? Now tell us, and
acknowledge thy fault; saying, Be-
hold here is “money; and also we
will grant unto thee thy life if thou
wilt tell us, and acknowledge the
agreement which thou hast made
with him.

21 But Nephi said unto them: O ye

 

390

“fools, ye uncircumcised of heart, ye
blind, and ye °’stiffnecked people,
do ye know how long the Lord your
God will suffer you that ye shall go
on in this your way of sin?

22 O ye ought to begin to howl
and “mourn, because of the great
destruction which at this time doth
await you, except ye shall repent.

23 Behold ye say that I have agreed
with a man that he should murder
Seezoram, our chief judge. But be-
hold, I say unto you, that this is
because I have testified unto you
that ye might know concerning this
thing; yea, even for a witness unto
you, that I did know of the wicked-
ness and abominations which are
among you.

24 And because I have done this,
ye say that I have agreed with a
man that he should do this thing;
yea, because I showed unto you this
sign ye are angry with me, and seek
to destroy my life.

25 And now behold, I will show
unto you another sign, and see if
ye will in this thing seek to de-
stroy me.

26 Behold I say unto you: Go to
the house of Seantum, who is the
“brother of Seezoram, and say unto
him—

27 Has Nephi, the pretended
prophet, who doth prophesy so much
evil concerning this people, agreed
with thee, in the which ye have
murdered Seezoram, who is your
brother?

28 And behold, he shall say unto
you, Nay.

29 And ye shall say unto him: Have
ye murdered your brother?

30 And he shall stand with fear,
and wist not what to say. And be-
hold, he shall deny unto you; and
he shall make as if he were aston-
ished; nevertheless, he shall declare
unto you that he is innocent.

31 But behold, ye shall examine

him, and ye shall find blood upon
the skirts of his cloak.

32 And when ye have seen this,
ye shall say: From whence cometh
this blood? Do we not know that it
is the blood of your brother?

33 And then shall he tremble, and
shall look pale, even as if death had
come upon him.

34 And then shall ye say: Because
of this fear and this paleness which
has come upon your face, behold,
we know that thou art guilty.

35 And then shall greater fear
come upon him; and then shall he
confess unto you, and deny no more
that he has done this murder.

36 And then shall he say unto
you, that I, Nephi, know nothing
concerning the matter save it were
given unto me by the power of God.
And then shall ye know that I am
an honest man, and that Iam sent
unto you from God.

37 And it came to pass that they
went and did, even according as
Nephi had said unto them. And be-
hold, the words which he had said
were true; for according to the words
he did deny; and also according to
the words he did confess.

38 And he was brought to prove
that he himself was the very mur-
derer, insomuch that the five were
set at liberty, and also was Nephi.

39 And there were some of the
Nephites who believed on the words
of Nephi; and there were some
also, who believed because of the
testimony of the five, for they had
been converted while they were
in prison.

40 And now there were some
among the people, who said that
Nephi was a prophet.

41 And there were others who said:
Behold, he is a god, for except he
was a god he could not “know of
all things. For behold, he has told

 

HELAMAN 9:32-10:5

us the thoughts of our hearts, and
also has told us things; and even
he has brought unto our knowl-
edge the true murderer of our chief
judge.

CHAPTER 10

The Lord gives Nephi the sealing
power—He is empowered to bind and
loose on earth and in heaven—He com-
mands the people to repent or perish—
The Spirit carries him from multitude
to multitude. About 21-20 B.c.

AND it came to pass that there arose
a division among the people, inso-
much that they divided hither and
thither and went their ways, leaving
Nephi alone, as he was standing in
the midst of them.

2 And it came to pass that Nephi
went his way towards his own house,
“pondering upon the things which
the Lord had shown unto him.

3 And it came to pass as he was
thus pondering—being much cast
down because of the wickedness of
the people of the Nephites, their
secret works of darkness, and their
murderings, and their plunderings,
and all manner of iniquities—and
it came to pass as he was thus pon-
dering in his heart, behold, a “voice
came unto him saying:

4 "Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those
things which thou hast done; for
I have beheld how thou hast with
bunwearyingness declared the word,
which I have given unto thee, unto
this people. And thou hast not feared
them, and hast not sought thine
‘own life, but hast sought my @will,
and to keep my commandments.

5 And now, because thou hast done
this with such unwearyingness, be-
hold, I will bless thee forever; and I
will make thee mighty in word and
in deed, in faith and in works; yea,
even that “all things shall be "done

unto thee according to thy ‘word,
for thou shalt “not ask that which
is contrary to my will.

6 Behold, thou art Nephi, and I
am God. Behold, I declare it unto
thee in the presence of mine angels,
that ye shall have power over this
people, and shall smite the earth
with “famine, and with pestilence,
and destruction, according to the
wickedness of this people.

7 Behold, I give unto you “power,
that whatsoever ye shall ’seal on
earth shall be sealed in heaven;
and whatsoever ye shall loose on
earth shall be loosed in heaven; and
thus shall ye have power among
this people.

8 And thus, if ye shall say unto this
temple it shall be rent in twain, it
shall be done.

9 And if ye shall say unto this
“mountain, Be thou cast down and
become smooth, it shall be done.

10 And behold, if ye shall say that
God shall smite this people, it shall
come to pass.

11 And now behold, I command
you, that ye shall go and declare
unto this people, that thus saith the
Lord God, who is the Almighty: Ex-
cept ye repent ye shall be smitten,
even unto “destruction.

12 And behold, now it came to
pass that when the Lord had spoken
these words unto Nephi, he did stop
and did not go unto his own house,
but did return unto the multitudes
who were scattered about upon
the face of the land, and began to
declare unto them the word of the
Lord which had been spoken unto
him, concerning their destruction
if they did not repent.

13 Now behold, ‘notwithstanding
that great miracle which Nephi
had done in telling them concern-
ing the death of the chief judge,

 

392

they did harden their hearts and
did not hearken unto the words of
the Lord.

14 Therefore Nephi did declare
unto them the word of the Lord,
saying: Except ye repent, thus saith
the Lord, ye shall be “smitten even
unto destruction.

15 And it came to pass that when
Nephi had declared unto them the
word, behold, they did still harden
their hearts and would not hearken
unto his words; therefore they did
“revile against him, and did seek to
lay their hands upon him that they
might cast him into prison.

16 But behold, the power of God
was with him, and they could not
take him to cast him into prison,
for he was taken by the Spirit and
“conveyed away out of the midst
of them.

17 And it came to pass that thus
he did go forth in the Spirit, from
multitude to multitude, declaring
the word of God, even until he had
declared it unto them all, or sent it
forth among all the people.

18 And it came to pass that they
would not hearken unto his words;
and there began to be contentions,
insomuch that they were divided
against themselves and began to
slay one another with the sword.

19 And thus ended the seventy and
first year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi.

CHAPTER 11

Nephi persuades the Lord to replace
their war with a famine—Many people
perish—They repent, and Nephi impor-
tunes the Lord for rain—Nephi and
Lehi receive many revelations—The
Gadianton robbers entrench themselves
in the land. About 20-6 B.c.

AND now it came to pass in the sev-
enty and second year of the reign
of the judges that the contentions
did increase, insomuch that there
were wars throughout all the land
among all the people of Nephi.

2 And it was this “secret band of
robbers who did carry on this work
of destruction and wickedness. And
this war did last all that year; and
in the seventy and third year it did
also last.

3 And it came to pass that in this
year Nephi did cry unto the Lord,
saying:

40 Lord, do not suffer that this
people shall be destroyed by the
sword; but O Lord, rather “let there
be a °famine in the land, to stir
them up in remembrance of the
Lord their God, and perhaps they
will repent and turn unto thee.

5 And so it was done, according
to the words of Nephi. And there
was a great famine upon the land,
among all the people of Nephi. And
thus in the seventy and fourth year
the famine did continue, and the
work of destruction did cease by the
sword but became sore by famine.

6 And this work of destruction did
also continue in the seventy and
fifth year. For the earth was smitten
that it was ¢dry, and did not yield
forth grain in the season of grain;
and the whole earth was smitten,
even among the Lamanites as well
as among the Nephites, so that they
were smitten that they did perish
by thousands in the more wicked
parts of the land.

7 And it came to pass that the
people saw that they were about to
perish by famine, and they began
to “remember the Lord their God;
and they began to remember the
words of Nephi.

8 And the people “began to plead
with their chief judges and their

 

HELAMAN 11:1-15

leaders, that they would say unto
Nephi: Behold, we know that thou
art a man of God, and therefore
cry unto the Lord our God that he
turn away from us this famine, lest
all the words which thou hast spo-
ken concerning our ’destruction
be fulfilled.

9 And it came to pass that the
judges did say unto Nephi, accord-
ing to the words which had been
desired. And it came to pass that
when Nephi saw that the people
had “repented and did humble
themselves in sackcloth, he cried
again unto the Lord, saying:

10 O Lord, behold this people re-
penteth; and they have swept away
the band of Gadianton from amongst
them insomuch that they have be-
come extinct, and they have con-
cealed their secret plans in the earth.

11 Now, O Lord, because of this
their humility wilt thou turn away
thine anger, and let thine anger
be appeased in the destruction of
those wicked men whom thou hast
already destroyed.

12 O Lord, wilt thou turn away
thine anger, yea, thy fierce anger, and
cause that this famine may cease in
this land.

13 O Lord, wilt thou hearken unto
me, and cause that it may be done ac-
cording to my words, and send forth
“rain upon the face of the earth,
that she may bring forth her fruit,
and her grain in the season of grain.

14 OLord, thou didst hearken unto
4my words when I said, Let there
be a famine, that the pestilence of
the sword might cease; and I know
that thou wilt, even at this time,
hearken unto my words, for thou
saidst that: If this people repent I
will spare them.

15 Yea, O Lord, and thou seest
that they have repented, because of
the famine and the pestilence and

destruction which has come unto
them.

16 And now, O Lord, wilt thou
turn away thine anger, and try
again if they will serve thee? And
if so, O Lord, thou canst bless them
according to thy words which thou
hast said.

17 And it came to pass that in the
seventy and sixth year the Lord did
turn away his anger from the peo-
ple, and caused that “rain should
fall upon the earth, insomuch that
it did bring forth her fruit in the
season of her fruit. And it came to
pass that it did bring forth her grain
in the season of her grain.

18 And behold, the people did re-
joice and glorify God, and the whole
face of the land was filled with re-
joicing; and they did no more seek to
destroy Nephi, but they did esteem
him as a “great prophet, and a man
of God, having great power and au-
thority given unto him from God.

19 And behold, Lehi, his brother,
was not a “whit behind him as to
things pertaining to righteousness.

20 And thus it did come to pass
that the people of Nephi began to
prosper again in the land, and be-
gan to build up their waste places,
and began to multiply and spread,
even until they did “cover the whole
face of the land, both on the north-
ward and on the southward, from
the sea west to the sea east.

21 And it came to pass that the
seventy and sixth year did end in
peace. And the seventy and seventh
year began in peace; and the “church
did spread throughout the face of all
the land; and the more part of the
people, both the Nephites and the
Lamanites, did belong to the church;
and they did have exceedingly great
peace in the land; and thus ended
the seventy and seventh year.

22 And also they had peace in the

 

394

seventy and eighth year, save it were
a few contentions concerning the
points of doctrine which had been
laid down by the prophets.

23 And in the seventy and ninth
year there began to be much strife.
But it came to pass that Nephi and
Lehi, and many of their brethren
who knew concerning the true
points of doctrine, having many
“revelations daily, therefore they
did preach unto the people, inso-
much that they did put an end to
their strife in that same year.

24 And it came to pass that in the
eightieth year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi,
there were a certain number of the
dissenters from the people of Nephi,
who had some years before gone
over unto the Lamanites, and taken
upon themselves the name of La-
manites, and also acertain number
who were real descendants of the
Lamanites, being stirred up to anger
by them, or by those dissenters,
therefore they commenced a “war
with their brethren.

25 And they did commit murder
and plunder; and then they would
retreat back into the mountains,
and into the wilderness and secret
places, hiding themselves that they
could not be discovered, receiving
daily an addition to their numbers,
inasmuch as there were dissenters
that went forth unto them.

26 And thus in time, yea, even in
the space of *not many years, they
became an exceedingly great band
of robbers; and they did search out
all the ’secret plans of Gadianton;
and thus they became robbers of
Gadianton.

27 Now behold, these robbers did
make great havoc, yea, even great
destruction among the people of
Nephi, and also among the people
of the Lamanites.

28 And it came to pass that it was
expedient that there should be a
stop put to this work of destruc-
tion; therefore they sent an army
of strong men into the wilderness
and upon the mountains to search
out this band of robbers, and to
destroy them.

29 But behold, it came to pass that
in that same year they were driven
back even into their own lands.
And thus ended the eightieth year
of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

30 And it came to pass in the
commencement of the eighty and
first year they did go forth again
against this band of robbers, and
did destroy many; and they were
also visited with much destruction.

31 And they were again obliged to
return out of the wilderness and out
of the “mountains unto their own
lands, because of the exceeding
greatness of the numbers of those
robbers who infested the mountains
and the wilderness.

32 And it came to pass that thus
ended this year. And the robbers
did still increase and wax strong,
insomuch that they did defy the
whole armies of the Nephites, and
also of the Lamanites; and they did
cause great fear to come unto the
people upon all the face of the land.

33 Yea, for they did visit many
parts of the land, and did do great
destruction unto them; yea, did kill
many, and did carry away others
captive into the wilderness, yea,
and more especially their women
and their children.

34 Now this great evil, which came
unto the people because of their
iniquity, did stir them up again in
“remembrance of the Lord their God.

35 And thus ended the eighty and
first year of the reign of the judges.

 

HELAMAN 11:28-12:2

36 And in the eighty and second
year they began again to “forget the
Lord their God. And in the eighty
and third year they began to wax
strong in iniquity. And in the eighty
and fourth year they did not mend
their ways.

37 And it came to pass in the eighty
and fifth year they did wax stron-
ger and stronger in their pride, and
in their wickedness; and thus they
were “ripening again for destruction.

38 And thus ended the eighty and
fifth year.

CHAPTER 12

Men are unstable and foolish and
quick to do evil—The Lord chastens
His people—The nothingness of men is
compared with the power of God—in
the day of judgment, men will gain ev-
erlasting life or everlasting damnation.
About 6 B.C.

AND thus we can behold how false,
and also the unsteadiness of the
hearts of the children of men; yea,
we can see that the Lord in his
great infinite goodness doth bless
and “prosper those who put their
’trust in him.

2 Yea, and we may see at the very
“time when he doth "prosper his
people, yea, in the increase of their
fields, their flocks and their herds,
and in gold, and in silver, and in all
manner of ‘precious things of every
kind and art; sparing their lives,
and delivering them out of the
hands of their enemies; softening
the hearts of their enemies that they
should not declare wars against
them; yea, and in fine, doing all
things for the welfare and happiness
of his people; yea, then is the time
that they do “harden their hearts,
and do “forget the Lord their God,
and do ‘trample under their feet the

Holy One—yea, and this because of
their ease, and their exceedingly
great prosperity.

3 And thus we see that except the
Lord doth ¢chasten his people with
many afflictions, yea, except he doth
visit them with °death and with ter-
ror, and with famine and with all
manner of pestilence, they will not
‘remember him.

40 how “foolish, and how vain,
and how evil, and devilish, and how
’quick to do iniquity, and how slow
to do good, are the children of men;
yea, how quick to hearken unto the
words of the evil one, and to set
their “hearts upon the vain things of
the world!

5 Yea, how quick to be lifted up
in “pride; yea, how quick to "boast,
and do all manner of that which is
iniquity; and how slow are they to
remember the Lord their God, and
to give ear unto his counsels, yea,
how slow to ‘walk in wisdom’s paths!

6 Behold, they do not desire that
the Lord their God, who hath “cre-
ated them, should ’rule and reign
over them; notwithstanding his
great goodness and his mercy to-
wards them, they do set at “naught
his counsels, and they will not that
he should be their guide.

7 O how great is the ‘nothingness of
the children of men; yea, even they
are “less than the dust of the earth.

8 For behold, the dust of the earth
moveth hither and thither, to the
dividing asunder, at the command
of our great and everlasting God.

9 Yea, behold at his ¢voice do the

 

396

hills and the mountains tremble
and quake.

10 And by the “power of his voice
they are broken up, and become
smooth, yea, even like unto a valley.

11 Yea, by the power of his voice
doth the «whole earth shake;

12 Yea, by the power of his voice,
do the foundations rock, even to
the very center.

13 Yea, and if he say unto the
earth—Move—it is moved.

14 Yea, if he say unto the “earth—
Thou shalt °go back, that it “lengthen
out the day for many hours—it is
done;

15 And thus, according to his
word the “earth goeth back, and it
appeareth unto man that the "sun
standeth still; yea, and behold, this
is so; for surely it is the earth that
moveth and not the sun.

16 And behold, also, if he say unto
the ‘waters of the great deep—’Be
thou dried up—it is done.

17 Behold, if he say unto this
mountain—Be thou raised up, and
“come over and fall upon that city,
that it be buried up—behold it is
done.

18 And behold, ifa man “hide upa
treasure in the earth, and the Lord
shall say—Let it be ’accursed, be-
cause of the iniquity of him who
hath hid it up—behold, it shall be
accursed,

19 And if the Lord shall say—Be
thou accursed, that no man shall
find thee from this time henceforth
and forever—behold, no man getteth
it henceforth and forever.

20 And behold, if the Lord shall
say unto a man—Because of thine
iniquities, thou shalt be accursed
*forever—it shall be done.

21 And if the Lord shall say—Be-
cause of thine iniquities thou shalt
be “cut off from my presence—he
will cause that it shall be so.

22 And wo unto him to whom he
shall say this, for it shall be unto
him that will do iniquity, and he
cannot be “saved; therefore, for this
cause, that men might be saved, hath
repentance been declared.

23 Therefore, blessed are they who
will repent and hearken unto the
voice of the Lord their God; for these
are they that shall be saved.

24 And may God grant, in his great
fulness, that men might be brought
unto repentance and good works, that
they might be restored unto grace
for “grace, according to their works.

25 And I would that all men might
be saved. But we read that in the
*ereat and last day there are some
who shall be cast out, yea, who shall
be cast off from the "presence of
the Lord;

26 Yea, who shall be consigned to
a state of endless misery, fulfilling
the words which say: They that have
done good shall have “everlasting
life; and they that have done evil
shall have everlasting 'damnation.
And thus it is. Amen.

The prophecy of Samuel, the
Lamanite, to the Nephites.
Comprising chapters 13 through 15.

CHAPTER 13

Samuel the Lamanite prophesies the
destruction of the Nephites unless

 

HELAMAN 12:20-13:6

they repent—They and their riches
dare cursed—They reject and stone the
prophets, are encircled about by de-
mons, and seek for happiness in doing
iniquity. About 6 B.C.

AND now it came to pass in the
eighty and sixth year, the Nephites
did still remain in wickedness, yea,
in great wickedness, while the *La-
manites did observe strictly to keep
the commandments of God, accord-
ing to the law of Moses.

2 And it came to pass that in this
year there was one “Samuel, a °La-
manite, came into the land of Zara-
hemla, and began to preach unto the
people. And it came to pass that he
did preach, many days, repentance
unto the people, and they did ‘cast
him out, and he was about to “return
to his own land.

3 But behold, the “voice of the Lord
came unto him, that he should re-
turn again, and prophesy unto the
people whatsoever things should
come into his heart.

4 And it came to pass that they
would not suffer that he should en-
ter into the city; therefore he went

stretched forth his hand and cried
with a loud voice, and "prophesied
unto the people whatsoever things
the Lord put into his heart.

5 And he said unto them: Behold,
I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the
words of the Lord which he doth put
into my heart; and behold he hath
put it into my heart to say unto this
people that the “sword of justice
hangeth over this people; and four
hundred years pass not away save
the sword of justice falleth upon
this people.

this people, and it surely cometh
unto this people, and nothing can
save this people save it be repentance
and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ,
who surely shall come into the
world, and shall suffer many things
and shall be slain for his people.

7 And behold, an “angel of the Lord
hath declared it unto me, and he
did bring "glad tidings to my soul.
And behold, I was sent unto you
to declare it unto you also, that ye
might have glad tidings; but behold
ye would ‘not receive me.

8 Therefore, thus saith the Lord:
Because of the hardness of the
hearts of the people of the Neph-
ites, except they repent I will take
away my word from them, and I will
*withdraw my Spirit from them, and
I will suffer them no longer, and I
will turn the hearts of their brethren
against them.

9 And “four hundred years shall
not pass away before I will cause
that they shall be smitten; yea, I
will visit them with the sword and
with famine and with pestilence.

10 Yea, I will visit them in my
fierce anger, and there shall be
those of the “fourth generation
who shall live, of your enemies, to
behold your utter destruction; and
this shall surely come except ye re-
pent, saith the Lord; and those of the
fourth generation shall visit your
destruction.

11 But if ye will repent and “return
unto the Lord your God I will turn
away mine anger, saith the Lord;
yea, thus saith the Lord, blessed
are they who will repent and turn
unto me, but wo unto him that re-
penteth not.

12 Yea, “wo unto this great city of
Zarahemla; for behold, it is because
of those who are righteous that it

 

398

is saved; yea, wo unto this great
city, for I perceive, saith the Lord,
that there are many, yea, even the
more part of this great city, that
will harden their hearts against
me, saith the Lord.

13 But blessed are they who will
repent, for them will I spare. But
behold, if it were not for the righ-
teous who are in this great city, be-
hold, I would cause that “fire should
come down out of heaven and
’destroy it.

14 But behold, it is for the righ-
teous’ sake that it is spared. But
behold, the time cometh, saith the
Lord, that when ye shall cast out
the righteous from among you, then
shall ye be “ripe for destruction; yea,
wo be unto this great city, because
of the wickedness and abominations
which are in her.

15 Yea, and wo be unto the city
of Gideon, for the wickedness and
abominations which are in her.

16 Yea, and wo be unto all the
cities which are in the land round
about, which are possessed by the
Nephites, because of the wicked-
ness and abominations which are
in them.

17 And behold, a “curse shall
come upon the land, saith the Lord
of Hosts, because of the people’s
sake who are upon the land, yea,
because of their wickedness and
their abominations.

18 And it shall come to pass, saith
the Lord of Hosts, yea, our great and
true God, that whoso shall “hide
up treasures in the earth shall find
them again no more, because of the
great curse of the land, save he be
a righteous man and shall hide it
up unto the Lord.

19 For I will, saith the Lord, that
they shall hide up their “treasures

unto me; and cursed be they who
hide not up their treasures unto me;
for none hideth up their treasures
unto me save it be the righteous; and
he that hideth not up his treasures
unto me, cursed is he, and also the
treasure, and none shall redeem it
because of the curse of the land.

20 And the day shall come that
they shall hide up their treasures,
because they have set their hearts
upon riches; and because they have
set their hearts upon their riches,
and will hide up their treasures
when they shall flee before their
enemies; because they will not
hide them up unto me, cursed be
they and also their treasures; and
in that day shall they be smitten,
saith the Lord.

21 Behold ye, the people of this
great city, and hearken unto my
words; yea, hearken unto the words
which the Lord saith; for behold, he
saith that ye are “cursed because
of your riches, and also are your
riches cursed because ye have set
your hearts upon them, and have
not "hearkened unto the words of
him who gave them unto you.

22 Ye do not remember the Lord
your God in the things with which
he hath blessed you, but ye do al-
ways remember your “riches, not to
thank the Lord your God for them;
yea, your hearts are not drawn out
unto the Lord, but they do swell
with great pride, unto "boasting,
and unto great ‘swelling, “envy-
ings, strifes, malice, persecutions,
and murders, and all manner of
iniquities.

23 For this cause hath the Lord
God caused that a curse should come
upon the land, and also upon your

 

HELAMAN 13:20-28

riches, and this because of your
iniquities.

24 Yea, wo unto this people, be-
cause of this time which has arrived,
that ye do “cast out the prophets,
and do mock them, and cast stones
at them, and do slay them, and do
all manner of iniquity unto them,
even as they did of old time.

25 And now when ye talk, ye say:
If our days had been in the days of
our “fathers of old, we would not
have ’slain the prophets; we would
not have stoned them, and cast
them out.

26 Behold ye are worse than they;
for as the Lord liveth, if a “prophet
come among you and declareth unto
you the word of the Lord, which tes-
tifieth of your "sins and iniquities,
ye are ‘angry with him, and cast him
out and seek all manner of ways to
destroy him; yea, you will say that
he is a “false ‘prophet, and that he
is a sinner, and of the devil, be-
cause he ‘testifieth that your deeds
are evil.

27 But behold, if a man shall come
among you and shall say: Do this,
and there is no iniquity; do that and
ye shall not suffer; yea, he will say:
“Walk after the pride of your own
hearts; yea, walk after the pride of
your eyes, and do whatsoever your
heart desireth—and if a man shall
come among you and say this, ye
will receive him, and say that he
is a "prophet.

28 Yea, ye will lift him up, and ye
will give unto him of your substance;
ye will give unto him of your gold,
and of your silver, and ye will clothe
him with costly apparel; and be-
cause he speaketh “flattering words
unto you, and he saith that all is

well, then ye will not find fault
with him.

29 O ye wicked and ye perverse
generation; ye hardened and ye
4stiffnecked people, how long will ye
suppose that the Lord will suffer you?
Yea, how long will ye suffer your-
selves to be led by *foolish and ‘blind
guides? Yea, how long will ye “choose
darkness rather than ‘light?

30 Yea, behold, the anger of the
Lord is already kindled against you;
behold, he hath cursed the land be-
cause of your iniquity.

31 And behold, the time cometh
that he curseth your riches, that
they become “slippery, that ye can-
not hold them; and in the days of
your poverty ye cannot retain them.

32 And in the days of your poverty
ye shall cry unto the Lord; and in
vain shall ye cry, for your desolation
is already come upon you, and your
destruction is made sure; and then
shall ye weep and howl in that day,
saith the Lord of Hosts. And then
shall ye lament, and say:

33 O *that I had repented, and
had not killed the prophets, and
’stoned them, and cast them out.
Yea, in that day ye shall say: O
that we had remembered the Lord
our God in the day that he gave us
our riches, and then they would
not have become slippery that we
should lose them; for behold, our
riches are gone from us.

34 Behold, we lay a tool here and
on the morrow it is gone; and be-
hold, our swords are taken from us
in the day we have sought them for
battle.

35 Yea, we have hid up our “trea-
sures and they have slipped away
from us, because of the curse of
the land.

36 O that we had repented in the

 

400

day that the word of the Lord came
unto us; for behold the land is
cursed, and all things are become
slippery, and we cannot hold them.

37 Behold, we are surrounded by
*demons, yea, we are encircled about
by the angels of him who hath
sought to destroy our souls. Behold,
our iniquities are great. O Lord,
canst thou not turn away thine an-
ger from us? And this shall be your
language in those days.

38 But behold, your “days of pro-
bation are past; ye have ’procras-
tinated the day of your salvation
until it is everlastingly too late, and
your destruction is made sure; yea,
for ye have sought all the days of
your lives for that which ye could
not obtain; and ye have sought for
‘happiness in doing iniquity, which
thing is “contrary to the nature of
that righteousness which is in our
great and Eternal Head.

39 O ye people of the land, that
ye would hear my words! And I
pray that the anger of the Lord be
turned away from you, and that ye
would repent and be saved.

redeems men from temporal and spir-

include three days of darkness, the rend-
ing of the rocks, and great upheavals
of nature. About 6 B.C.

AND now it came to pass that *“Sam-
uel, the Lamanite, did prophesy
a great many more things which
cannot be written.

to redeem all those who shall be-
lieve on his name.

3 And behold, this will I give unto
you for a “sign at the time of his
coming; for behold, there shall be
great lights in heaven, insomuch
that in the night before he cometh
there shall be no darkness, insomuch
that it shall appear unto man as if
it was day.

4 Therefore, there shall be one
“day and a night and a day, as if
it were one day and there were no
night; and this shall be unto you
for a sign; for ye shall know of the
rising of the sun and also of its set-
ting; therefore they shall know ofa
surety that there shall be two days
and a night; nevertheless the night
shall not be darkened; and it shall
be the night before he is "born.

5 And behold, there shall a new
“star arise, such an one as ye never
have beheld; and this also shall be
a sign unto you.

6 And behold this is not all, there
shall be many “signs and wonders
in heaven.

7 And it shall come to pass that ye
shall all be amazed, and wonder, inso-
much that ye shall “fall to the earth.

8 And it shall come to pass that
whosoever shall “believe on the Son
of God, the same shall have ever-
lasting life.

9 And behold, thus hath the Lord
commanded me, by his angel, that
I should come and tell this thing
unto you; yea, he hath commanded
that Ishould prophesy these things
unto you; yea, he hath said unto
me: Cry unto this people, repent
and prepare the way of the Lord.

 

HELAMAN 14:3-16

10 And now, because I am a La-
manite, and have spoken unto you
the words which the Lord hath
commanded me, and because it was
hard against you, ye are angry with
me and do seek to destroy me, and
have “cast me out from among you.

11 And ye shall “hear my words,
for, for this intent have I come up
upon the walls of this city, that ye
might hear and know of the judg-
ments of God which do await you
because of your iniquities, and also
that ye might know the conditions
of repentance;

12 And also that ye might know of
the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son
of God, the “Father of heaven and of
earth, the Creator of all things from
the beginning; and that ye might
know of the signs of his coming,
to the intent that ye might believe
on his name.

13 And if ye “believe on his name
ye will repent of all your sins, that
thereby ye may have a remission of
them through his merits.

14 And behold, again, another
sign I give unto you, yea, a sign of
his ¢death.

15 For behold, he surely must
die that “salvation may come; yea,
it behooveth him and becometh
expedient that he ’dieth, to bring to
pass the ‘resurrection of the dead,
that thereby men may be brought
into the “presence of the Lord.

16 Yea, behold, this death bringeth
to pass the “resurrection, and ’re-
deemeth all mankind from the first
death—that spiritual death; for all
mankind, by the ‘fall of Adam be-
ing ‘cut off from the presence of

the Lord, are considered as ‘dead,
both as to things temporal and to
things spiritual.

17 But behold, the resurrection of
Christ *“redeemeth mankind, yea,
even all mankind, and bringeth
them back into the presence of the
Lord.

18 Yea, and it bringeth to pass
the condition of repentance, that
whosoever repenteth the same is
not “hewn down and cast into the
fire; but whosoever repenteth not is
hewn down and cast into the fire;
and there cometh upon them again
a spiritual death, yea, a second
death, for they are cut off again as to
things pertaining to righteousness.

19 Therefore repent ye, repent ye,
lest by knowing these things and
not doing them ye shall suffer your-
selves to come under condemnation,
and ye are brought down unto this
second death.

20 But behold, as I said unto you
concerning another “sign, a sign of
his death, behold, in that day that
he shall suffer death the sun shall
be darkened and refuse to give his
‘light unto you; and also the moon
and the stars; and there shall be no
light upon the face of this land, even
from the time that he shall suffer
death, for the space of ‘three days,
to the time that he shall rise again
from the dead.

21 Yea, at the time that he shall
yield up the “ghost there shall be
*thunderings and lightnings for the
space of many hours, and the earth
shall shake and tremble; and the
‘rocks which are upon the face of
this earth, which are both above the
earth and beneath, which ye know
at this time are solid, or the more

 

402

part of it is one solid mass, shall be
“broken up;

22 Yea, they shall be rent in twain,
and shall ever after be “found in
seams and in cracks, and in bro-
ken fragments upon the face of the
whole earth, yea, both above the
earth and beneath.

23 And behold, there shall be
great *tempests, and there shall be
many mountains laid low, like unto
a valley, and there shall be many
places which are now called >val-
leys which shall become mountains,
whose height is great.

24 And “many highways shall be
broken up, and many cities shall
become desolate.

25 And many “graves shall be
opened, and shall yield up many of
their dead; and many saints shall
appear unto many.

26 And behold, thus hath the 7an-
gel spoken unto me; for he said unto
me that there should be thunder-
ings and lightnings for the space
of many hours.

27 And he said unto me that while
the thunder and the lightning
lasted, and the tempest, that these
things should be, and that “darkness
should cover the face of the whole
earth for the space of three days.

28 And the angel said unto me
that many shall see greater things
than these, to the intent that they
might believe that “these signs and
these wonders should come to pass
upon all the face of this land, to
the intent that there should be no
cause for unbelief among the chil-
dren of men—

29 And this to the intent that who-
soever will believe might be saved,
and that whosoever will not believe,

a “righteous judgment might come
upon them; and also if they are con-
demned they bring upon themselves
their own condemnation.

30 And now remember, remember,
my brethren, that whosoever perish-
eth, perisheth unto “himself; and
whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it
unto himself; for behold, ye are *free;
ye are permitted to act for your-
selves; for behold, God hath given
unto you a ‘knowledge and he hath
made you free.

31 He hath given unto you that ye
might “know good from evil, and he
hath given unto you that ye might
’choose life or death; and ye can
do good and be ‘restored unto that
which is good, or have that which is
good restored unto you; or ye can
do evil, and have that which is evil
restored unto you.

CHAPTER 15

The Lord chastened the Nephites because
He loved them—Converted Lamanites
are firm and steadfast in the faith—The
Lord will be merciful unto the Lamanites
in the latter days. About 6 B.C.

AND now, my beloved brethren, be-
hold, I declare unto you that except
ye shall repent your houses shall
be left unto you “desolate.

2 Yea, except ye repent, your women
shall have great cause to mourn in
the day that they shall give suck; for
ye shall attempt to flee and there
shall be no place for “refuge; yea,
and wo unto them which are °with
child, for they shall be heavy and
cannot flee; therefore, they shall
be trodden down and shall be left
to perish.

3 Yea, wo unto this “people who

 

HELAMAN 14:30-15:7

are called the *people of Nephi ex-
cept they shall repent, when they
shall see all these signs and wonders
which shall be showed unto them;
for behold, they have been a chosen
people of the Lord; yea, the people
of Nephi hath he loved, and also
hath he ‘chastened them; yea, in
the days of their iniquities hath he
chastened them because he loveth
them.

4 But behold my brethren, the
*Lamanites hath he hated because
their deeds have been evil continu-
ally, and this because of the iniquity
of the "tradition of their fathers.
But behold, salvation hath come
unto them through the preaching
of the Nephites; and for this in-
tent hath the Lord ‘prolonged their
days.

5 And I would that ye should be-
hold that the “more part of them
are in the path of their duty, and
they do walk circumspectly before
God, and they do observe to keep
his commandments and his statutes
and his judgments according to the
law of Moses.

6 Yea, Isay unto you, that the more
part of them are doing this, and
they are striving with “unwearied
diligence that they may bring the
remainder of their brethren to the
knowledge of the truth; therefore
there are many who do add to their
numbers daily.

7 And behold, ye do know of your-
selves, for ye have witnessed it, that
as many of them as are brought to
the knowledge of the truth, and to
know of the wicked and abominable
traditions of their fathers, and are
led to believe the holy scriptures,
yea, the prophecies of the holy
prophets, which are written, which

and repentance bringeth a “change
of heart unto them—

8 Therefore, as many as have come
to this, ye know of yourselves are
“firm and steadfast in the faith, and
in the thing wherewith they have
been made free.

9 And ye know also that they have
*buried their weapons of war, and
they fear to take them up lest by
any means they should sin; yea, ye
can see that they fear to sin—for
behold they will suffer themselves
that they be trodden down and slain
by their enemies, and will not lift
their swords against them, and this
because of their ’faith in Christ.

10 And now, because of their
“steadfastness when they do believe
in that thing which they do believe,
for because of their firmness when
they are once enlightened, behold,
the Lord shall bless them and pro-
long their days, notwithstanding
their iniquity—

11 Yea, even if they should dwindle
in unbelief the Lord shall ¢prolong
their days, until the time shall come
which hath been spoken of by our
fathers, and also by the prophet
’Zenos, and many other prophets,
concerning the ‘restoration of our
brethren, the Lamanites, again to
the knowledge of the truth—

12 Yea, Isay unto you, that in the
latter times the “promises of the
Lord have been extended to our
brethren, the Lamanites; and not-
withstanding the many afflictions
which they shall have, and notwith-
standing they shall be ’driven to
and fro upon the face of the earth,
and be hunted, and shall be smit-
ten and scattered abroad, having no

 

404

place for ‘refuge, the Lord shall be
4merciful unto them.

13 And this is according to the
prophecy, that they shall again be
*brought to the true knowledge,
which is the knowledge of their
Redeemer, and their great and true
’shepherd, and be numbered among
his ‘sheep.

14 Therefore 1 say unto you, it
shall be “better for them than for
you except ye repent.

15 For behold, “had the mighty
works been shown unto them which
have been shown unto you, yea,
unto them who have dwindled in
unbelief because of the traditions
of their fathers, ye can see of your-
selves that they never would again
have dwindled in unbelief.

16 Therefore, saith the Lord: I will
not utterly destroy them, but I
will cause that in the day of my
wisdom they shall “return again
unto me, saith the Lord.

17 And now behold, saith the
Lord, concerning the people of the
Nephites: If they will not repent,
and observe to do my will, I will ut-
terly “destroy them, saith the Lord,
because of their unbelief notwith-
standing the many mighty works
which I have done among them;
and as surely as the Lord liveth
shall these things be, saith the Lord.

AND now, it came to pass that there
were many who heard the words
of Samuel, the Lamanite, which he
spake upon the “walls of the city.
And as many as believed on his word
went forth and sought for Nephi;
and when they had come forth and
found him they confessed unto him
their sins and denied not, desiring
that they might be "baptized unto
the Lord.

2 But as many as there were who
did not believe in the words of Sam-
uel were ‘angry with him; and they
cast stones at him upon the wall,
and also many shot arrows at him
as he stood upon the wall; but the
Spirit of the Lord was with him,
insomuch that they could not hit
him with their stones neither with
their arrows.

3 Now when they saw that they
could not hit him, there were many
more who did believe on his words,
insomuch that they went away unto
Nephi to be baptized.

4 For behold, Nephi was baptizing,
and prophesying, and preaching,
crying repentance unto the people,
showing signs and wonders, working
“miracles among the people, that
they might know that the Christ
must "shortly come—

5 Telling them of things which
must shortly come, that they might
know and remember at the time of
their coming that they had been
made known unto them beforehand,
to the intent that they might believe;
therefore as many as believed on the
words of Samuel went forth unto
him to be baptized, for they came
repenting and confessing their sins.

6 But the ¢more part of them did
not believe in the words of Samuel;
therefore when they saw that they
could not hit him with their stones
and their arrows, they cried unto
their captains, saying: "Take this
fellow and bind him, for behold

 

HELAMAN 16:1-15

he ‘hath a devil; and because of the
power of the devil which is in him
we cannot hit him with our stones
and our arrows; therefore take him
and bind him, and away with him.

7 And as they went forth to lay
their hands on him, behold, he did
cast himself down from the wall,
and did flee out of their lands, yea,
even unto his own country, and
began to preach and to prophesy
“among his own people.

8 And behold, he was never heard
of more among the Nephites; and
thus were the affairs of the people.

9 And thus ended the eighty and
sixth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi.

10 And thus ended also the eighty
and seventh year of the reign of the
judges, the more part of the people
remaining in their pride and wick-
edness, and the lesser part walking
more circumspectly before God.

11 And these were the conditions
also, in the eighty and eighth year
of the reign of the judges.

12 And there was but little altera-
tion in the affairs of the people,
save it were the people began to be
more hardened in iniquity, and do
more and more of that which was
“contrary to the commandments of
God, in the eighty and ninth year
of the reign of the judges.

13 But it came to pass in the nine-
tieth year of the reign of the judges,
there were “great signs given unto
the people, and wonders; and the
words of the prophets "began to
be fulfilled.

14 And 4angels did appear unto
men, wise men, and did declare
unto them glad tidings of great joy;
thus in this year the scriptures be-
gan to be fulfilled.

15 Nevertheless, the people began
to harden their hearts, all save it
were the most believing part of them,
both of the Nephites and also of the

Lamanites, and began to depend
upon their own strength and upon
their own wisdom, saying:

16 Some things they may have
guessed right, among so many; but
behold, we know that all these great
and marvelous works cannot come
to pass, of which has been spoken.

17 And they began to reason and to
contend among themselves, saying:

18 That it is “not reasonable that
such a being as a Christ shall come;
if so, and he be the Son of God, the
Father of heaven and of earth, as it
has been spoken, why will he not
show himself unto us as well as unto
them who shall be at Jerusalem?

19 Yea, why will he not show him-
self in this land as well as in the
land of Jerusalem?

20 But behold, we know that this is
a wicked “tradition, which has been
handed down unto us by our fathers,
to cause us that we should believe
in some great and marvelous thing
which should come to pass, but not
among us, but in a land which is
far distant, a land which we know
not; therefore they can Keep us in
ignorance, for we cannot ’witness
with our own eyes that they are true.

21 And they will, by the cunning
and the mysterious arts of the evil

 

406

one, work some great mystery which
we cannot understand, which will
keep us down to be servants to
their words, and also servants unto
them, for we depend upon them to
teach us the word; and thus will
they keep us in ignorance if we will
yield ourselves unto them, all the
days of our lives.

22 And many more things did the
people “imagine up in their hearts,
which were foolish and °vain; and
they were much disturbed, for Sa-
tan did stir them up to do iniquity
continually; yea, he did go about
spreading ‘rumors and contentions
upon all the face of the land, that
he might harden the hearts of the
people against that which was good
and against that which should come.

23 And notwithstanding the
signs and the wonders which were
wrought among the people of the
Lord, and the many miracles which
they did, Satan did get great hold
upon the hearts of the people upon
all the face of the land.

24 And thus ended the ninetieth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi.

25 “And thus ended the book of
Helaman, according to the record
of Helaman and his sons.

THIRD NEPHI
THE BOOK OF NEPHI

THE SON OF NEPHI, WHO WAS THE SON OF HELAMAN

And Helaman was the son of Helaman, who was the son of Alma, who was the
son of Alma, being a descendant of Nephi who was the son of Lehi, who came
out of Jerusalem in the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, the king of Judah.

new star arises—Lyings and deceivings
increase, and the Gadianton robbers
slaughter many. About A.D. 1-4.

OW it came to pass that the

ninety and first year had

passed away and it was 4six
hundred years from the time that
Lehi left Jerusalem; and it was in
the year that "Lachoneus was the
chief judge and the governor over
the land.

2 And *Nephi, the son of Hela-
man, had departed out of the land
of Zarahemla, giving charge unto
his son "Nephi, who was his eldest
son, concerning the ‘plates of brass,
and “all the records which had been
kept, and all those things which
had been kept sacred from the de-
parture of Lehi out of Jerusalem.

3 Then he “departed out of the
land, and whither he went, no man
knoweth; and his son Nephi did
keep the records in his stead, yea,
the record of this people.

4 And it came to pass that in the
commencement of the ninety and
second year, behold, the prophecies
of the prophets began to be fulfilled
more fully; for there began to be
*ereater signs and greater miracles
wrought among the people.

5 But there were some who began
to say that the time was past for the
words to be fulfilled, which were
*spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite.

6 And they began to “rejoice over
their brethren, saying: Behold the
time is past, and the words of Sam-
uel are not fulfilled; therefore, your
joy and your faith concerning this
thing hath been vain.

7 And it came to pass that they did
make a great uproar throughout the

 

3 NEPHI 1:1-14

land; and the people who believed
began to be very sorrowful, lest
by any means those things which
had been spoken might not come
to pass.

8 But behold, they did watch stead-
fastly for “that day and that night
and that day which should be as
one day as if there were no night,
that they might know that their
faith had not been vain.

9 Now it came to pass that there
was a day set apart by the “unbe-
lievers, that all those who believed
in those traditions should be "put to
death except the ‘sign should come
to pass, which had been given by
Samuel the prophet.

10 Now it came to pass that when
Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw this
wickedness of his people, his heart
was exceedingly sorrowful.

11 And it came to pass that he
went out and bowed himself down
upon the earth, and cried mightily
to his God in behalf of his people,
yea, those who were about to be
destroyed because of their faith in
the tradition of their fathers.

12 And it came to pass that he
cried mightily unto the Lord all
that day; and behold, the ’voice of
the Lord came unto him, saying:

13 Lift up your head and be of
good cheer; for behold, the time is
at hand, and on this night shall the
“sign be given, and on the "morrow
come I into the world, to show unto
the world that I will fulfil all that
which I have caused to be ‘spoken
by the mouth of my holy prophets.

14 Behold, I “come unto my own,
to fulfil all things which I have
made known unto the children of
men from the ‘foundation of the

world, and to do the will, °both ‘of
the Father and of the Son—of the
Father because of me, and of the
Son because of my flesh. And be-
hold, the time is at hand, and this
night shall the sign be given.

15 And it came to pass that the
words which came unto Nephi
were fulfilled, according as they
had been spoken; for behold, at the
going down of the “sun there was
’no darkness; and the people began
to be astonished because there was
no darkness when the night came.

16 And there were many, who
had not believed the words of the
prophets, who “fell to the earth and
became as if they were dead, for
they knew that the great "plan of
destruction which they had laid for
those who believed in the words of
the prophets had been frustrated;
for the sign which had been given
was already at hand.

17 And they began to know that
the Son of God must shortly appear;
yea, in fine, all the people upon the
face of the whole earth from the
“west to the east, both in the land
north and in the land south, were
so exceedingly astonished that they
fell to the earth.

18 For they knew that the proph-
ets had testified of these things for
many years, and that the sign which
had been given was already at hand;
and they began to fear because of
their iniquity and their unbelief.

19 And it came to pass that there
was no darkness in all that night,
but it was as light as though it was
mid-day. And it came to pass that the
sun did rise in the morning again,
according to its proper order; and
they knew that it was the day that
the Lord should be “born, because
of the ’sign which had been given.

 

408

20 And it had come to pass, yea,
all things, every whit, according to
the words of the prophets.

21 And it came to pass also that
a new ‘star did appear, according
to the word.

22 And it came to pass that from
this time forth there began to be
“lyings sent forth among the people,
by Satan, to harden their hearts, to
the intent that they might not be-
lieve in those ’signs and wonders
which they had seen; but notwith-
standing these lyings and deceivings
the ‘more part of the people did
believe, and were converted unto
the Lord.

23 And it came to pass that Nephi
went forth among the people, and
also many others, baptizing unto
repentance, in the which there was
a great “remission of sins. And thus
the people began again to have
peace in the land.

24 And there were no contentions,
save it were a few that began to
preach, endeavoring to prove by
the “scriptures that it was no more
expedient to observe the law of
Moses. Now in this thing they did
err, having not understood the
scriptures.

25 But it came to pass that they
soon became converted, and were
convinced of the error which they
were in, for it was made known
unto them that the law was not yet
“fulfilled, and that it must be ful-
filled in every whit; yea, the word
came unto them that it must be
fulfilled; yea, that one jot or tittle
should not pass away till it should
all be fulfilled; therefore in this
same year were they brought toa
knowledge of their error and did
’confess their faults.

year did pass away, bringing “glad
tidings unto the people because of
the signs which did come to pass,
according to the words of the proph-
ecy of all the holy prophets.

27 And it came to pass that the
ninety and third year did also pass
away in peace, save it were for the
Gadianton robbers, who dwelt upon
the “mountains, who did infest the
land; for so strong were their holds
and their secret places that the
people could not overpower them;
therefore they did commit many
murders, and did do much slaugh-
ter among the people.

28 And it came to pass that in the
ninety and fourth year they began
to increase in a great degree, be-
cause there were many dissenters
of the Nephites who did flee unto
them, which did cause much sor-
row unto those Nephites who did
remain in the land.

29 And there was also a cause of
much sorrow among the Lamanites;
for behold, they had many children
who did grow up and began to wax
strong in years, that they became for
themselves, and were “led away by
some who were °Zoramites, by their
lyings and their flattering words,
to join those Gadianton robbers.

30 And thus were the Lamanites
afflicted also, and began to decrease
as to their faith and righteousness,
because of the wickedness of the
“rising generation.

CHAPTER 2

Wickedness and abominations increase
among the people—The Nephites and
Lamanites unite to defend themselves
against the Gadianton robbers—Con-
verted Lamanites become white and
are called Nephites. About A.D. 5-16.

AND it came to pass that thus
passed away the ninety and fifth

 

3 NEPHI 1:27-2:8

year also, and the people began to
forget those “signs and wonders
which they had heard, and began
to be less and less astonished at a
sign or a wonder from heaven, in-
somuch that they began to be hard
in their hearts, and blind in their
minds, and began to disbelieve all
which they had heard and seen—

2 “Imagining up some vain thing
in their hearts, that it was wrought
by men and by the power of the
devil, to lead away and *deceive
the hearts of the people; and thus
did Satan get possession of the
hearts of the people again, inso-
much that he did blind their eyes
and lead them away to believe that
the doctrine of Christ was a ‘foolish
and a vain thing.

3 And it came to pass that the
people began to wax strong in wick-
edness and abominations; and they
did not believe that there should be
any more signs or wonders given;
and Satan did “go about, leading
away the hearts of the people,
tempting them and causing them
that they should do great wickedness
in the land.

4 And thus did pass away the
ninety and sixth year; and also
the ninety and seventh year; and
also the ninety and eighth year;
and also the ninety and ninth year;

5 And also an hundred years
had passed away since the days of
*Mosiah, who was king over the
people of the Nephites.

6 And six hundred and nine years
had passed away since Lehi left
Jerusalem.

7 And nine years had passed away
from the time when the sign was
given, which was spoken of by the
prophets, that Christ should come
into the world.

8 Now the Nephites began to
*reckon their time from this period

when the sign was given, or from
the coming of Christ; therefore, nine
years had passed away.

9 And Nephi, who was the father
of Nephi, who had the charge of the
records, “did not return to the land
of Zarahemla, and could nowhere
be found in all the land.

10 And it came to pass that the peo-
ple did still *remain in wickedness,
notwithstanding the much preach-
ing and prophesying which was
sent among them; and thus passed
away the tenth year also; and the
eleventh year also passed away in
iniquity.

11 And it came to pass in the
thirteenth year there began to be
wars and contentions throughout
all the land; for the “Gadianton rob-
bers had become so "numerous, and
did slay so many of the people,
and did lay waste so many cities, and
did spread so much death and
carnage throughout the land, that
it became expedient that all the
people, both the Nephites and the
Lamanites, should take up arms
against them.

12 Therefore, all the Lamanites
who had become converted unto the
Lord did unite with their brethren,
the Nephites, and were compelled,
for the ‘safety of their lives and their
women and their children, to take
up arms against those Gadianton
robbers, yea, and also to maintain
their rights, and the privileges of
their church and of their worship,
and their freedom and their “liberty.

13 And it came to pass that before
this thirteenth year had passed away
the Nephites were threatened with
utter destruction because of this
war, which had become exceedingly
sore.

14 And it came to pass that those
Lamanites who had united with the
Nephites were numbered among
the Nephites;

 

410

15 And their “curse was taken from
them, and their skin became ’white
like unto the Nephites;

16 And their young men and their
daughters became exceedingly fair,
and they were numbered among
the Nephites, and were called Neph-
ites. And thus ended the thirteenth
year.

17 And it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the fourteenth year,
the war between the robbers and
the people of Nephi did continue
and did become exceedingly sore;
nevertheless, the people of Nephi
did gain some advantage of the
robbers, insomuch that they did
drive them back out of their lands
into the mountains and into their
secret places.

18 And thus ended the fourteenth
year. And in the fifteenth year they
did come forth against the people
of Nephi; and because of the wick-
edness of the people of Nephi, and
their many contentions and dissen-
sions, the Gadianton robbers did
gain many advantages over them.

19 And thus ended the fifteenth
year, and thus were the people in
a state of many afflictions; and the
4¢sword of destruction did hang over
them, insomuch that they were
about to be smitten down by it,
and this because of their iniquity.

AND now it came to pass that in the

words which were written, saying:

governor of the land, behold, I write
this epistle unto you, and do give
unto you exceedingly great praise
because of your firmness, and also
the firmness of your people, in
*maintaining that which ye suppose
to be your right and "liberty; yea,
ye do stand well, as if ye were sup-
ported by the hand of a god, in the
defence of your liberty, and your
property, and your country, or that
which ye do call so.

3 And it seemeth a pity unto me,
most noble Lachoneus, that ye
should be so foolish and vain as to
suppose that ye can stand against
so many brave men who are at my
command, who do now at this time
stand in their arms, and do await
with great anxiety for the word—
Go down upon the Nephites and
“destroy them.

4 And I, knowing of their uncon-
querable spirit, having proved them
in the field of battle, and knowing of
their everlasting hatred towards you
because of the many wrongs which
ye have done unto them, therefore
if they should come down against
you they would visit you with utter
destruction.

5 Therefore I have written this
epistle, sealing it with mine own
hand, feeling for your welfare, be-
cause of your firmness in that which
ye believe to be right, and your noble
spirit in the field of battle.

6 Therefore I write unto you, desir-
ing that ye would yield up unto this
my people, your cities, your lands,
and your possessions, rather than
that they should visit you with the
sword and that destruction should
come upon you.

7 Or in other words, yield your-

 

3 NEPHI 3:2-12

selves up unto us, and unite with
us and become acquainted with
our “secret works, and become our
brethren that ye may be like unto
us—not our slaves, but our brethren
and partners of all our substance.

8 And behold, I “swear unto you,
if ye will do this, with an oath, ye
shall not be destroyed; but if ye will
not do this, I swear unto you with
an oath, that on the morrow month I
will command that my armies shall
come down against you, and they
shall not stay their hand and shall
spare not, but shall slay you, and
shall let fall the sword upon you
even until ye shall become extinct.

9 And behold, I am *Giddianhi;
and I am the governor of this the
’secret society of Gadianton; which
society and the works thereof I
know to be ‘good; and they are of
4ancient date and they have been
handed down unto us.

10 And I write this epistle unto
you, Lachoneus, and I hope that ye
will deliver up your lands and your
possessions, without the shedding
of blood, that this my people may
recover their rights and “govern-
ment, who have dissented away
from you because of your wicked-
ness in retaining from them their
rights of government, and except ye
do this, I will avenge their wrongs.
Lam Giddianhi.

11 And now it came to pass when
Lachoneus received this epistle he
was exceedingly astonished, be-
cause of the boldness of Giddianhi
demanding the possession of the
land of the Nephites, and also of
threatening the people and aveng-
ing the wrongs of those that had
received no wrong, save it were
they had “wronged themselves by
dissenting away unto those wicked
and abominable robbers.

12 Now behold, this Lachoneus,

the governor, was a just man, and
could not be frightened by the
demands and the threatenings of
a “robber; therefore he did not
hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi,
the governor of the robbers, but he
did cause that his people should cry
unto the Lord for ’strength against
the time that the robbers should
come down against them.

13 Yea, he sent a proclamation
among all the people, that they
should “gather together their women,
and their children, their flocks and
their herds, and all their substance,
save it were their land, unto one place.

14 And he caused that “fortifica-
tions should be built round about
them, and the strength thereof
should be exceedingly great. And
he caused that armies, both of the
Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of
all them who were numbered among
the Nephites, should be placed as
guards round about to watch them,
and to guard them from the robbers
day and night.

15 Yea, he said unto them: As the
Lord liveth, except ye repent of all
your iniquities, and cry unto the
Lord, ye will in nowise be “delivered
out of the hands of those Gadianton
robbers.

16 And so great and marvelous
were the words and prophecies of
Lachoneus that they did cause fear
to come upon all the people; and
they did exert themselves in their
might to do according to the words
of Lachoneus.

17 And it came to pass that La-
choneus did appoint chief captains
over all the armies of the Nephites,
to command them at the time that
the robbers should come down out
of the wilderness against them.

18 Now the chiefest among all the

 

412

chief captains and the great com-
mander of all the armies of the
Nephites was appointed, and his
name was “Gidgiddoni.

19 Now it was the custom among
all the Nephites to appoint for their
chief captains, (save it were in their
times of wickedness) some one that
had the “spirit of revelation and
also prophecy; therefore, this Gid-
giddoni was a great prophet among
them, as also was the chief judge.

20 Now the people said unto Gid-
giddoni: “Pray unto the Lord, and let
us go up upon the mountains and
into the wilderness, that we may
fall upon the robbers and destroy
them in their own lands.

21 But Gidgiddoni saith unto them:
The Lord “forbid; for if we should
go up against them the Lord would
’deliver us into their hands; there-
fore we will prepare ourselves in
the center of our lands, and we will
gather all our armies together, and
we will not go against them, but we
will wait till they shall come against
us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if
we do this he will deliver them into
our hands.

22 And it came to pass in the sev-
enteenth year, in the latter end of
the year, the proclamation of La-
choneus had gone forth throughout
all the face of the land, and they
had taken their “horses, and their
chariots, and their cattle, and all
their flocks, and their herds, and
their grain, and all their substance,
and did march forth by thousands
and by tens of thousands, until they
had all gone forth to the "place
which ‘had been appointed that
they should gather themselves to-
gether, to defend themselves against
their enemies.

appointed was the land of Zara-
hemla, and the land which was
between the land Zarahemla and
the land °Bountiful, yea, to the
line which was between the ‘land
Bountiful and the land Desolation.

24 And there were a great many
thousand people who were called
Nephites, who did gather them-
selves together in this land. Now
Lachoneus did cause that they
should gather themselves together
in the land “southward, because of
the great curse which was upon the
*land northward.

25 And they did fortify themselves
against their enemies; and they did
dwell in one land, and in one body,
and they did fear the words which
had been spoken by Lachoneus,
insomuch that they did repent of
all their sins; and they did put up
their “prayers unto the Lord their
God, that he would deliver them in
the time that their enemies should
come down against them to battle.

26 And they were exceedingly sor-
rowful because of their enemies.
And Gidgiddoni did cause that they
should make “weapons of war of ev-
ery kind, and they should be strong
with armor, and with shields, and
with bucklers, after the manner of
his instruction.

CHAPTER 4

The Nephite armies defeat the Gadian-
ton robbers—Giddianhi is slain, and his
successor, Zemnarihah, is hanged—The
Nephites praise the Lord for their vic-
tories. About A.D. 19-22.

AND it came to pass that in the lat-
ter end of the eighteenth year those
armies of “robbers had prepared
for battle, and began to come down
and to sally forth from the hills,
and out of the mountains, and the

 

3 NEPHI 3:24—4:6

wilderness, and their strongholds,
and their "secret places, and be-
gan to take possession of the lands,
both which were in the land south
and which were in the land north,
and began to take possession of all
the lands which had been “deserted
by the Nephites, and the cities which
had been left desolate.

2 But behold, there were no wild
beasts nor “game in those lands
which had been deserted by the
Nephites, and there was no game
for the robbers save it were in the
wilderness.

3 And the robbers could not exist
save it were in the wilderness, for
the want of food; for the Nephites
had left their lands desolate, and
had gathered their flocks and their
herds and all their substance, and
they were in one body.

4 Therefore, there was no chance
for the robbers to plunder and to
obtain food, save it were to come
up in open battle against the Neph-
ites; and the Nephites being in one
body, and having so great a num-
ber, and having reserved for them-
selves provisions, and “horses and
cattle, and flocks of every kind, that
they might subsist for the space
of seven years, in the which time
they did hope to destroy the rob-
bers from off the face of the land;
and thus the eighteenth year did
pass away.

5 And it came to pass that in the
nineteenth year Giddianhi found
that it was expedient that he should
go up to battle against the Neph-
ites, for there was “no way that they
could subsist save it were to plun-
der and rob and murder.

6 And they durst not spread them-
selves upon the face of the land in-
somuch that they could raise grain,
lest the Nephites should come upon

them and slay them; therefore Gid-
dianhi gave commandment unto
his armies that in this year they
should go up to battle against the
Nephites.

7 And it came to pass that they did
come up to battle; and it was in the
sixth month; and behold, great and
terrible was the day that they did
come up to battle; and they were
girded about after the manner of
robbers; and they had a lamb-skin
about their loins, and they were
dyed in blood, and their heads were
shorn, and they had head-plates
upon them; and great and terrible
was the appearance of the armies of
Giddianhi, because of their armor,
and because of their being dyed
in blood.

8 And it came to pass that the
armies of the Nephites, when they
saw the appearance of the army
of Giddianhi, had all fallen to the
earth, and did lift their cries to the
Lord their God, that he would spare
them and deliver them out of the
hands of their enemies.

9 And it came to pass that when
the armies of Giddianhi saw this
they began to shout with a loud
voice, because of their joy, for they
had supposed that the Nephites had
fallen with fear because of the ter-
ror of their armies.

10 But in this thing they were
disappointed, for the Nephites did
not “fear them; but they did fear
their God and did supplicate him
for "protection; therefore, when the
armies of Giddianhi did rush upon
them they were prepared to meet
them; yea, in the strength of the
Lord they did receive them.

11 And the battle commenced in
this the sixth month; and great and
terrible was the battle thereof, yea,
great and terrible was the ‘slaughter
thereof, insomuch that there never
was known so great a slaughter
among all the people of Lehi since
he left Jerusalem.

 

414

12 And notwithstanding the
*threatenings and the oaths which
Giddianhi had made, behold, the
Nephites did beat them, insomuch
that they did fall back from before
them.

13 And it came to pass that *Gid-
giddoni commanded that his armies
should pursue them as far as the
borders of the wilderness, and that
they should not spare any that
should fall into their hands by the
way; and thus they did pursue them
and did slay them, to the borders
of the wilderness, even until they
had fulfilled the commandment of
Gidgiddoni.

14 And it came to pass that Gid-
dianhi, who had stood and fought
with boldness, was pursued as he
fled; and being weary because of
his much fighting he was overtaken
and slain. And thus was the end of
Giddianhi the robber.

15 And it came to pass that the
armies of the Nephites did return
again to their place of security. And
it came to pass that this nineteenth
year did pass away, and the rob-
bers did not come again to battle;
neither did they come again in the
twentieth year.

16 And in the twenty and first year
they did not come up to battle, but
they came up on all sides to lay siege
round about the people of Nephi;
for they did suppose that if they
should cut off the people of Nephi
from their “lands, and should hem
them in on every side, and if they
should cut them off from all their
outward privileges, that they could
cause them to yield themselves up
according to their wishes.

17 Now they had appointed unto
themselves another leader, whose
name was Zemnarihah; therefore
it was Zemnarihah that did cause
that this siege should take place.

18 But behold, this was an ad-
vantage to the Nephites; for it was
impossible for the robbers to lay

siege sufficiently long to have any
effect upon the Nephites, because
of their “much "provision which
they had laid up in store,

19 And because of the scantiness
of provisions among the robbers;
for behold, they had nothing save
it were meat for their subsistence,
which meat they did obtain in the
wilderness;

20 And it came to pass that the
“wild game became scarce in the wil-
derness insomuch that the robbers
were about to perish with hunger.

21 And the Nephites were continu-
ally marching out by day and by
night, and falling upon their armies,
and cutting them off by thousands
and by tens of thousands.

22 And thus it became the desire of
the people of Zemnarihah to with-
draw from their design, because of
the great destruction which came
upon them by night and by day.

23 And it came to pass that Zem-
narihah did give command unto his
people that they should withdraw
themselves from the siege, and
march into the furthermost parts
of the land northward.

24 And now, Gidgiddoni being
aware of their design, and knowing
of their weakness because of the
want of food, and the great slaugh-
ter which had been made among
them, therefore he did send out his
armies in the night-time, and did
cut off the way of their retreat, and
did place his armies in the way of
their retreat.

25 And this did they do in the
night-time, and got on their march
beyond the robbers, so that on the
morrow, when the robbers began
their march, they were met by the
armies of the Nephites both in their
front and in their rear.

26 And the robbers who were on
the south were also cut off in their

 

3 NEPHI 4:19-33

places of retreat. And all these
things were done by command of
Gidgiddoni.

27 And there were many thou-
sands who did yield themselves up
prisoners unto the Nephites, and
the remainder of them were slain.

28 And their leader, Zemnarihah,
was taken and hanged upon atree,
yea, even upon the top thereof un-
til he was dead. And when they
had hanged him until he was dead
they did fell the tree to the earth,
and did cry with a loud voice,
saying:

29 May the Lord preserve his peo-
ple in righteousness and in holiness
of heart, that they may cause to be
felled to the earth all who shall seek
to slay them because of power and
secret combinations, even as this
man hath been felled to the earth.

30 And they did rejoice and cry
again with one voice, saying: May
the *God of Abraham, and the God
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, pro-
tect this people in righteousness, so
long as they shall ’call on the name
of their God for ‘protection.

31 And it came to pass that they
did break forth, all as one, in sing-
ing, and “praising their God for
the great thing which he had done
for them, in preserving them from
falling into the hands of their
enemies.

32 Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to
the Most High God. And they did
cry: Blessed be the name of the Lord
God “Almighty, the Most High God.

33 And their hearts were swollen
with joy, unto the gushing out of
many tears, because of the great
goodness of God in delivering them
out of the hands of their enemies;
and they knew it was because of
their repentance and their humility
that they had been delivered from
an everlasting destruction.

CHAPTER 5

The Nephites repent and forsake their
sins—Mormon writes the history of his
people and declares the everlasting word
to them—lIsrael will be gathered in from
her long dispersion. About A.D. 22-26.

AND now behold, there was not a
living soul among all the people
of the Nephites who did “doubt in
the least the words of all the holy
prophets who had spoken; for they
knew that it must needs be that
they must be fulfilled.

2 And they knew that it must be
expedient that Christ had come, be-
cause of the many signs which had
been given, according to the words
of the prophets; and because of the
things which had come to pass al-
ready they knew that it must needs
be that all things should come to
pass according to that which had
been spoken.

3 Therefore they did forsake all
their sins, and their abominations,
and their whoredoms, and did serve
God with all diligence day and night.

4 And now it came to pass that
when they had taken all the rob-
bers prisoners, insomuch that none
did escape who were not slain, they
did cast their prisoners into prison,
and did cause the word of God to be
preached unto them; and as many
as would repent of their sins and
“enter into a °covenant that they
would murder no more were set at
‘liberty.

5 But as many as there were who
did not enter into a covenant, and
who did still continue to have those
secret murders in their hearts, yea,
as many as were found breathing
out threatenings against their breth-
ren were condemned and punished
according to the law.

6 And thus they did put an end

 

416

to all those wicked, and secret,
and abominable combinations,
in the which there was so much
wickedness, and so many murders
committed.

7 And thus had the “twenty and
second year passed away, and the
twenty and third year also, and the
twenty and fourth, and the twenty
and fifth; and thus had twenty and
five years passed away.

8 And there had many things tran-
spired which, in the eyes of some,
would be great and marvelous; nev-
ertheless, they cannot all be written
in this book; yea, this book cannot
contain even a “hundredth part
of what was done among so many
people in the space of twenty and
five years;

9 But behold there are “records
which do contain “all the proceed-
ings of this people; and a ‘shorter
but true account was given by
Nephi.

10 Therefore I have made my
“record of these things according
to the record of Nephi, which was
engraven on the plates which were
called the "plates of Nephi.

11 And behold, I do make the
record on plates which I have made
with mine own hands.

12 And behold, Iam called *Mor-
mon, being called after the "land of
Mormon, the land in which Alma
did establish the church among the
people, yea, the first church which
was established among them after
their transgression.

13 Behold, lama disciple of Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, I have been
“called of him to declare his word
among his people, that they might
have everlasting life.

14 And it hath become expedient
that I, according to the will of God,
that the prayers of those who have

gone hence, who were the holy ones,
should be fulfilled according to their
faith, should make a “record of these
things which have been done—

15 Yea, a“small record of that which
hath taken place from the time that
Lehi left Jerusalem, even down un-
til the present time.

16 Therefore I do make my record
from the accounts which have been
given by those who were before me,
until the commencement of my day;

17 And then Ido make a “record of
the things which I have seen with
mine own eyes.

18 And I know the record which I
make to be a just and a true record;
nevertheless there are many things
which, according to our “language,
we are not able to write.

19 And now I make an end of my
saying, which is of myself, and
proceed to give my account of the
things which have been before me.

20 1am Mormon, and a pure @de-
scendant of Lehi. I have reason to
bless my God and my Savior Jesus
Christ, that he brought our fathers
out of the land of Jerusalem, (and
’no one knew it save it were him-
self and those whom he brought
out of that land) and that he hath
given me and my people so much
knowledge unto the salvation of
our souls.

21 Surely he hath “blessed the
house of "Jacob, and hath been
‘merciful unto the seed of Joseph.

22 And “insomuch as the children
of Lehi have kept his command-
ments he hath blessed them and
prospered them according to his
word.

3 NEPHI 5:15-6:1

23 Yea, and surely shall he again
bring a “remnant of the seed of Jo-
seph to the "knowledge of the Lord
their God.

24 And as surely as the Lord liv-
eth, will he ¢gather in from the four
quarters of the earth all the rem-
nant of the "seed of Jacob, who are
scattered abroad upon all the face
of the earth.

25 And as he hath “covenanted with
all the house of Jacob, even so shall
the covenant wherewith he hath
covenanted with the house of Jacob
be fulfilled in his own due time,
unto the ’restoring all the house
of Jacob unto the knowledge of the
covenant that he hath covenanted
with them.

26 And then shall they “know their
Redeemer, who is Jesus Christ, the
Son of God; and then shall they be
gathered in from the four quarters
of the earth unto their own lands,
from whence they have been dis-
persed; yea, as the Lord liveth so
shall it be. Amen.

CHAPTER 6

The Nephites prosper—Pride, wealth,
and class distinctions arise—The
Church is rent with dissensions—Sa-
tan leads the people in open rebellion—
Many prophets cry repentance and are
slain—T heir murderers conspire to take
over the government. About A.D. 26-30.

AND now it came to pass that the
people of the Nephites did all return

and sixth year, every man, with

things whatsoever did belong unto
them.

2 And it came to pass that they had
“not eaten up all their provisions;
therefore they did take with them
all that they had not devoured, of
all their grain of every kind, and
their gold, and their silver, and all
their precious things, and they did
return to their own lands and their
possessions, both on the north and
on the south, both on the land north-
ward and on the land southward.

3 And they granted unto those
robbers who had “entered into a
covenant to keep the peace of the
land, who were desirous to remain
Lamanites, lands, according to their
numbers, that they might have, with
their labors, wherewith to subsist
upon; and thus they did establish
peace in all the land.

4 And they began again to prosper
and to wax great; and the twenty
and sixth and seventh years passed
away, and there was great “order
in the land; and they had formed
their laws according to equity and
justice.

5 And now there was nothing in
all the land to hinder the people
from prospering continually, except
they should fall into transgression.

6 And now it was *Gidgiddoni, and
the judge, "Lachoneus, and those
who had been appointed leaders,
who had established this great peace
in the land.

7 And it came to pass that there
were many cities built anew, and
there were many old cities repaired.

8 And there were many “highways
cast up, and many roads made,
which led from city to city, and
from land to land, and from place
to place.

 

418

9 And thus passed away the twenty
and eighth year, and the people had
continual peace.

10 But it came to pass in the twenty
and ninth year there began to be
some disputings among the people;
and some were lifted up unto pride
and “boastings because of their ex-
ceedingly great riches, yea, even
unto great persecutions;

11 For there were many “mer-
chants in the land, and also many
’lawyers, and many officers.

12 And the people began to be
distinguished by ranks, according
to their “riches and their chances
for learning; yea, some were ’igno-
rant because of their poverty, and
others did receive great ‘learning
because of their riches.

13 Some were lifted up in pride, and
others were exceedingly humble;
some did return railing for railing,
while others would receive railing
and “persecution and all manner
of ’afflictions, and would not turn
and ‘revile again, but were humble
and penitent before God.

14 And thus there became a great
inequality in all the land, insomuch
that the church began to be broken
up; yea, insomuch that in the thirti-
eth year the church was broken up
in all the land save it were among
a few of the Lamanites who were
converted unto the true faith; and
*they would not depart from it, for
they were firm, and steadfast, and
immovable, willing with all 'dili-
gence to keep the commandments
of the Lord.

15 Now the cause of this iniquity
of the people was this—*Satan had
great "power, unto the stirring up
of the people to do all manner of
iniquity, and to the puffing them up

with pride, tempting them to seek
for power, and authority, and ‘riches,
and the vain things of the world.

16 And thus Satan did lead away
the hearts of the people to do all
manner of iniquity; therefore they
had enjoyed peace but a few years.

17 And thus, in the commencement
of the thirtieth year—the people
having been ‘delivered up for the
space of a long time to be carried
about by the "temptations of the
devil whithersoever he desired to
carry them, and to do whatsoever
iniquity he desired they should—
and thus in the commencement of
this, the thirtieth year, they were in
a state of awful wickedness.

18 Now they did not sin “igno-
rantly, for they knew the >will of God
concerning them, for it had been
taught unto them; therefore they
did wilfully ‘rebel against God.

19 And now it was in the days of
Lachoneus, the son of “Lachoneus,
for Lachoneus did fill the seat of his
father and did govern the people
that year.

20 And there began to be men “in-
spired from heaven and sent forth,
standing among the people in all
the land, preaching and testifying
boldly of the sins and iniquities of
the people, and testifying unto them
concerning the redemption which
the Lord would make for his peo-
ple, or in other words, the resurrec-
tion of Christ; and they did testify
boldly of his "death and sufferings.

21 Now there were many of the
people who were exceedingly an-
gry because of those who testified
of these things; and those who were
angry were chiefly the chief judges,
and they who thad been high priests
and lawyers; yea, all those who were

 

3 NEPHI 6:16-28

lawyers were angry with those who
testified of these things.

22 Now there was no lawyer nor
judge nor high priest that could
have power to condemn any one to
death save their condemnation was
signed by the governor of the land.

23 Now there were many of those
*who testified of the things pertain-
ing to Christ who testified boldly,
who were taken and put to death
’secretly by the judges, that the
knowledge of their death came not
unto the governor of the land until
after their death.

24 Now behold, this was contrary
to the laws of the land, that any
man should be put to death except
they had power from the governor
of the land—

25 Therefore a complaint came up
unto the land of Zarahemla, to the
governor of the land, against these
judges who had condemned the
prophets of the Lord unto “death,
not according to the law.

26 Now it came to pass that they
were taken and brought up before
the judge, to be judged of the crime
which they had done, according to
the “law which had been given by
the people.

27 Now it came to pass that those
judges had many friends and kin-
dreds; and the remainder, yea, even
almost all the lawyers and the high
priests, did gather themselves to-
gether, and unite with the kindreds
of those judges who were to be tried
according to the law.

28 And they did enter into a “cov-
enant one with another, yea, even
into that covenant which was given
by them of old, which covenant was
given and administered by the "devil,
to combine against all righteousness.

29 Therefore they did combine
against the people of the Lord, and
enter into a covenant to destroy
them, and to deliver those who were
guilty of murder from the grasp of
justice, which was about to be ad-
ministered according to the law.

30 And they did set at defiance the
law and the rights of their country;
and they did covenant one with an-
other to destroy the governor, and
to establish a “king over the land,
that the land should no more be
at “liberty but should be subject
unto kings.

CHAPTER 7

The chief judge is murdered, the gov-
ernment is destroyed, and the people
divide into tribes—Jacob, an anti-
Christ, becomes king of a secret com-
bination—Nephi preaches repentance
and faith in Christ—Angels minister
to him daily, and he raises his brother
from the dead—Many repent and are
baptized. About A.D. 30-33.

Now behold, I will show unto you
that they did not establish a king
over the land; but in this same year,
yea, the thirtieth year, they did
destroy upon the judgment-seat,
yea, did murder the chief judge of
the land.

2 And the people were divided one
against another; and they did “sepa-
rate one from another into tribes,
every man according to his family
and his kindred and friends; and
thus they did destroy the govern-
ment of the land.

3 And every tribe did appoint a
chief or a leader over them; and
thus they became tribes and lead-
ers of tribes.

4 Now behold, there was no man
among them save he had much fam-
ily and many kindreds and friends;
therefore their tribes became ex-
ceedingly great.

 

420

5 Now all this was done, and there
were no wars as yet among them;
and all this iniquity had come upon
the people “because they did yield
themselves unto the power of Satan.

6 And the regulations of the gov-
ernment were destroyed, because
of the “secret combination of the
friends and kindreds of those who
murdered the prophets.

7 And they did cause a great con-
tention in the land, insomuch that
the more righteous part of the peo-
ple had nearly all become wicked;
yea, there were but few righteous
men among them.

8 And thus six years had not passed
away since the more part of the
people had turned from their righ-
teousness, like the dog to his “vomit,
or like the sow to her wallowing
in the mire.

9 Now this secret combination,
which had brought so great iniq-
uity upon the people, did gather
themselves together, and did place
at their head a man whom they did
call Jacob;

10 And they did call him their
king; therefore he became a king
over this wicked band; and he was
one of the chiefest who had given
his voice against the prophets who
testified of Jesus.

11 And it came to pass that they
were not so strong in number as
the tribes of the people, who were
united together save it were their
leaders did establish their laws,
every one according to his tribe;
nevertheless they were enemies; not-
withstanding they were not a righ-
teous people, yet they were united
in the hatred of those who had en-
tered into a covenant to “destroy the
government.

12 Therefore, Jacob seeing that
their enemies were more numerous
than they, he being the king of the
band, therefore he commanded his

people that they should take their
flight into the northernmost part of
the land, and there build up unto
themselves a “kingdom, until they
were joined by dissenters, (for he
flattered them that there would be
many dissenters) and they become
sufficiently strong to contend with
the tribes of the people; and they
did so.

13 And so speedy was their march
that it could not be impeded until
they had gone forth out of the reach
of the people. And thus ended the
thirtieth year; and thus were the
affairs of the people of Nephi.

14 And it came to pass in the
thirty and first year that they were
divided into tribes, every man
according to his family, kindred
and friends; nevertheless they had
come to an agreement that they
would not go to war one with an-
other; but they were not united as
to their laws, and their manner of
government, for they were estab-
lished according to the minds of
those who were their chiefs and
their leaders. But they did estab-
lish very strict laws that one tribe
should not trespass against another,
insomuch that in some degree they
had peace in the land; nevertheless,
their hearts were turned from the
Lord their God, and they did stone
the “prophets and did cast them
out from among them.

15 And it came to pass that
*Nephi—having been visited by an-
gels and also the voice of the Lord,
therefore having seen angels, and
being eye-witness, and having had
power given unto him that he might
know concerning the ministry of
Christ, and also being eye-witness
to their quick return from righ-
teousness unto their wickedness and
abominations;

 

3 NEPHI 7:13-22

16 Therefore, being “grieved for
the hardness of their hearts and
the blindness of their minds—went
forth among them in that same
year, and began to testify, boldly,
repentance and remission of sins
through faith on the Lord Jesus
Christ.

17 And he did minister many
things unto them; and all of them
cannot be written, and a part of
them would not suffice, therefore
they are not written in this book.
And Nephi did minister with “power
and with great authority.

18 And it came to pass that they
were angry with him, even because
he had greater power than they,
for it were “not possible that they
could disbelieve his words, for so
great was his faith on the Lord Jesus
Christ that angels did minister unto
him daily.

19 And in the name of Jesus did he
cast out devils and “unclean spirits;
and even his *brother did he ‘raise
from the dead, after he had been
stoned and suffered death by the
people.

20 And the people saw it, and did
witness of it, and were angry with
him because of his power; and he
did also do “many more miracles,
in the sight of the people, in the
name of Jesus.

21 And it came to pass that the
thirty and first year did pass away,
and there were but few who were
converted unto the Lord; but as
many as were converted did truly
signify unto the people that they
had been “visited by the power and
’Spirit of God, which was in Jesus
Christ, in whom they believed.

22 And as many as had devils cast
out from them, and were “healed
of their sicknesses and their infir-
mities, did truly manifest unto the

people that they had been wrought
upon by the Spirit of God, and had
been healed; and they did show
forth signs also and did do some
miracles among the people.

23 Thus passed away the thirty
and second year also. And Nephi
did cry unto the people in the com-
mencement of the thirty and third
year; and he did preach unto them
repentance and remission of sins.

24 Now I would have you to re-
member also, that there were none
who were brought unto “repentance
who were not baptized with water.

25 Therefore, there were ordained
of Nephi, men unto this ministry,
that all such as should come unto
them should be “baptized with wa-
ter, and this as a witness and a tes-
timony before God, and unto the
people, that they had repented and
received a ’remission of their sins.

26 And there were many in the
commencement of this year that
were baptized unto repentance;
and thus the more part of the year
did pass away.

CHAPTER 8

Tempests, earthquakes, fires, whirl-
winds, and physical upheavals attest
the crucifixion of Christ—Many people
dare destroyed—Darkness covers the
land for three days—Those who remain
bemoan their fate. About A.D. 33-34.

AND now it came to pass that ac-
cording to our record, and we know
our record to be “true, for behold,
it was a "just man who did keep
the record—for he truly did “many
4miracles in the ‘name of Jesus; and

 

422

there was not any man who could
do a miracle in the name of Jesus
save he were cleansed every whit
from his iniquity—

2 And now it came to pass, if
there was no mistake made by
this man in the reckoning of our
time, the “thirty and third year had
passed away;

3 And the people began to look
with great earnestness for the sign
which had been given by the prophet
Samuel, the Lamanite, yea, for the
time that there should be ¢darkness
for the space of three days over the
face of the land.

4 And there began to be great
“doubtings and ’disputations among
the people, notwithstanding so
many signs had been given.

5 And it came to pass in the “thirty
and fourth year, in the first month,
on the fourth day of the month,
there arose a great ’storm, such an
one as never had been known in all
the land.

6 And there was also a great and
terrible tempest; and there was ter-
rible “thunder, insomuch that it did
’shake the whole earth as if it was
about to divide asunder.

7 And there were exceedingly
sharp lightnings, such as never had
been known in all the land.

8 And the “city of Zarahemla did
take fire.

9 And the city of “Moroni did "sink
into the depths of the sea, and the
inhabitants thereof were drowned.

10 And the earth was carried up
upon the city of “*Moronihah, that in
the place of the city there became
a great ’mountain.

11 And there was a great and ter-
rible destruction in the land south-
ward.

12 But behold, there was a more
great and terrible destruction in
the land northward; for behold,
the “whole face of the land was
changed, because of the tempest
and the whirlwinds, and the thun-
derings and the lightnings, and the
exceedingly great quaking of the
whole earth;

13 And the “highways were bro-
ken up, and the level roads were
spoiled, and many smooth places
became rough.

14 And many “great and notable
cities were "sunk, and many were
‘burned, and many were shaken
till the buildings thereof had fallen
to the earth, and the inhabitants
thereof were slain, and the places
were left desolate.

15 And there were some cities
which remained; but the damage
thereof was exceedingly great, and
there were many in them who were
slain.

16 And there were some who were
carried away in the “whirlwind; and
whither they went no man knoweth,
save they know that they were car-
ried away.

17 And thus the face of the whole
earth became deformed, because of
the tempests, and the thunderings,
and the lightnings, and the quaking
of the earth.

18 And behold, the rocks were
rent in twain; they were broken up
upon the face of the whole earth,
insomuch that they were “found
in broken fragments, and in seams
and in cracks, upon all the face of
the land.

19 And it came to pass that when
the thunderings, and the lightnings,
and the storm, and the tempest,

 

3 NEPHI 8:11-25

and the quakings of the earth did
cease—for behold, they did last for
about the space of “three "hours;
and it was said by some that the
time was greater; nevertheless, all
these great and terrible things were
done in about the space of three
hours—and then behold, there was
‘darkness upon the face of the land.

20 And it came to pass that there
was thick darkness upon all the face
of the land, insomuch that the in-
habitants thereof who had not fallen
could “feel the vapor of darkness;

21 And there could be no light, be-
cause of the darkness, neither can-
dles, neither torches; neither could
there be fire kindled with their fine
and exceedingly dry wood, so that
there could not be any light at all;

22 And there was not any light
seen, neither fire, nor glimmer, nei-
ther the sun, nor the moon, nor the
stars, for so great were the mists of
darkness which were upon the face
of the land.

23 And it came to pass that it did
last for the space of three days that
there was no light seen; and there
was great mourning and “howling
and weeping among all the people
continually; yea, great were the
groanings of the people, because of
the darkness and the great destruc-
tion which had come upon them.

24 And in one place they were
heard to cry, saying: O that we had
repented “before this great and
terrible day, and then would our
brethren have been spared, and
they would not have been *burned
in that great city Zarahemla.

25 And in another place they were
heard to cry and mourn, saying: O
that we had repented before this
great and terrible day, and had
not killed and stoned the prophets,
and cast them out; then would our

mothers and our fair daughters, and

not have been buried up in that
great city “Moronihah. And thus
were the howlings of the people
great and terrible.

CHAPTER 9

In the darkness, the voice of Christ pro-
claims the destruction of many people
and cities for their wickedness—He
also proclaims His divinity, announces
that the law of Moses is fulfilled, and
invites men to come unto Him and be
saved. About A.D. 34.

AND it came to pass that there was a
*voice heard among all the inhabi-
tants of the earth, upon all the face
of this land, crying:

2 Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo
unto the inhabitants of the whole
earth except they shall “repent; for
the devil "laugheth, and his angels
rejoice, because of the slain of the
fair sons and daughters of my peo-
ple; and it is because of their iniq-
uity and abominations that they
are fallen!

3 Behold, that great city Zarahemla
have I ¢burned with fire, and the
inhabitants thereof.

4 And behold, that great city Mo-
roni have I caused to be “sunk in the
depths of the sea, and the inhabi-
tants thereof to be drowned.

5 And behold, that great city *Mo-
ronihah have I covered with earth,
and the inhabitants thereof, to hide
their iniquities and their abomina-
tions from before my face, that the
blood of the prophets and the saints
shall not come any more unto me
against them.

 

424

6 And behold, the city of Gilgal
have I caused to be sunk, and the
inhabitants thereof to be buried up
in the depths of the earth;

7 Yea, and the city of Onihah and
the inhabitants thereof, and the
city of Mocum and the inhabitants
thereof, and the city of “Jerusalem
and the inhabitants thereof; and
waters have I caused to come up
in the stead thereof, to hide their
wickedness and abominations from
before my face, that the ‘blood of
the prophets and the saints shall
4not come up any more unto me
against them.

8 And behold, the city of Gadiandi,
and the city of Gadiomnah, and
the city of Jacob, and the city of
Gimgimno, all these have I caused
to be sunk, and made “hills and val-
leys in the places thereof; and the
inhabitants thereof have I "buried
up in the depths of the earth, to
hide their wickedness and abomi-
nations from before my face, that
the blood of the prophets and the
saints should not come up any more
unto me against them.

9 And behold, that great city
Jacobugath, which was inhabited
by the people of king Jacob, have I
caused to be burned with fire be-
cause of their sins and their ¢wick-
edness, which was above all the
wickedness of the whole earth, be-
cause of their °secret murders and
combinations; for it was they that did
‘destroy the peace of my people and
the government of the land; there-
fore I did cause them to be burned,
to ‘destroy them from before my
face, that the blood of the prophets

10 And behold, the city of Laman,
and the city of Josh, and the city
of Gad, and the city of Kishkumen,
have I caused to be burned with
fire, and the inhabitants thereof,
because of their wickedness in cast-
ing out the prophets, and stoning
those whom I did send to declare
unto them concerning their wick-
edness and their abominations.

11 And because they did cast
them all out, that there were none
righteous among them, I did send
down “fire and destroy them, that
their wickedness and abominations
might be hid from before my ’face,
that the blood of the prophets and
the saints whom I sent among them
might not cry unto me ‘from the
ground against them.

12 And “many great destructions
have I caused to come upon this land,
and upon this people, because of
their wickedness and their abomi-
nations.

13 Oall ye that are “spared because
ye were more *righteous than they,
will ye not now return unto me, and
repent of your sins, and be con-
verted, that I may ‘heal you?

14 Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye
will “come unto me ye shall have
’eternal life. Behold, mine ‘arm of
mercy is extended towards you, and
whosoever will come, him will I
receive; and blessed are those who
come unto me.

and the Father in me; and in me
hath the Father glorified his name.

own “received me not. And the

are fulfilled.

17 And as many as have received
me, to them have I given to become
the sons of God; and even so will I
to as many as shall believe on my
name, for behold, by me ’redemp-
tion cometh, and ‘in me is the ‘law
of Moses fulfilled.

18 I am the “light and the life of

19 And ye shall offer up unto me
“no more the shedding of blood;
yea, your sacrifices and your burnt
offerings shall be done away, for I
will accept none of your sacrifices
and your burnt offerings.

20 And ye shall offer for a “sacri-
fice unto me a broken heart anda
contrite spirit. And whoso cometh
unto me with a broken heart anda
contrite spirit, him will 1 "baptize
with fire and with the Holy Ghost,
even as the Lamanites, because of
their faith in me at the time of their
conversion, were baptized with fire
and with the Holy Ghost, and they
knew it not.

21 Behold, I have come unto the
world to bring “redemption unto
the world, to save the world from sin.

CHAPTER 10

There is silence in the land for many
hours—The voice of Christ promises to
gather His people as a hen gathers her
chickens—The more righteous part of
the people have been preserved. About
A.D. 34-35.

AND now behold, it came to pass
that all the people of the land did
“hear these sayings, and did witness
of it. And after these sayings there
was silence in the land for the space
of many hours;

2 For so great was the astonishment
of the people that they did cease la-
menting and howling for the loss of
their kindred which had been slain;
therefore there was silence in all the
land for the space of many hours.

3 And it came to pass that there
came a voice again unto the people,
and all the people did hear, and did
witness of it, saying:

40 ye people of these “great cit-
ies which have fallen, who are de-
scendants of Jacob, yea, who are of
the house of Israel, how oft have I
bsathered you as a hen gathereth
her chickens under her wings, and
have ‘nourished you.

5 And again, “how oft would I have
gathered you as a hen gathereth
her chickens under her wings, yea,
O ye people of the house of Israel,
who have fallen; yea, O ye people

 

426

of the house of Israel, ye that dwell
at Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen;
yea, how oft would I have gathered
you as a hen gathereth her chick-
ens, and ye would not.

6 Oye house of Israel whom I have
“spared, how oft will I gather you
as a hen gathereth her chickens
under her wings, if ye will repent
and ’return unto me with full pur-
pose of ‘heart.

7 But if not, O house of Israel,
the places of your dwellings shall
become “desolate until the time of
the fulfilling of the "covenant to
your fathers.

8 And now it came to pass that
after the people had heard these
words, behold, they began to weep
and how] “again because of the loss
of their kindred and friends.

9 And it came to pass that thus did
the three days pass away. And it was
in the morning, and the “darkness
dispersed from off the face of the
land, and the earth did cease to
tremble, and the *rocks did cease
to rend, and the dreadful groanings
did cease, and all the tumultuous
noises did pass away.

10 And the earth did cleave to-
gether again, that it stood; and the
“mourning, and the weeping, and
the wailing of the people who were
spared alive did cease; and their
mourning was turned into joy, and
their lamentations into the "praise
and thanksgiving unto the Lord
Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.

11 And thus far were the “scrip-
tures fulfilled which had been
spoken by the prophets.

12 And it was the “more righteous
part of the people who were saved,
and it was they who received the

prophets and stoned them not; and it
was they who had not shed the blood
of the saints, who were spared—

13 And they were spared and were
not sunk and buried up in the earth;
and they were not drowned in the
depths of the sea; and they were not
burned by fire, neither were they
fallen upon and crushed to death;
and they were not carried away in
the whirlwind; neither were they
overpowered by the vapor of smoke
and of darkness.

14 And now, whoso readeth, let him
understand; he that hath the scrip-
tures, let him “search them, and see
and behold if all these deaths and
destructions by fire, and by smoke,
and by *tempests, and by whirl-
winds, and by the ‘opening of the
earth to receive them, and all these
things are not unto the fulfilling
of the prophecies of many of the
holy prophets.

15 Behold, I say unto you, Yea,
many have testified of these things
at the coming of Christ, and were
4slain because they testified of these
things.

16 Yea, the prophet *Zenos did
testify of these things, and also
Zenock spake 'concerning these
things, because they testified par-
ticularly concerning us, who are the
remnant of their seed.

17 Behold, our father Jacob also
testified concerning a “remnant of
the seed of Joseph. And behold, are
not we a remnant of the seed of
Joseph? And these things which tes-
tify of us, are they not written upon
the plates of brass which our father
Lehi brought out of Jerusalem?

18 And it came to pass that in the
ending of the thirty and fourth year,
behold, I will show unto you that the
people of Nephi who were spared,
and also those who had been called

 

3 NEPHI 10:13-11:2

*Lamanites, who had been spared,
did have great favors shown unto
them, and great "blessings poured
out upon their heads, insomuch that
soon after the ‘ascension of Christ
into heaven he did truly manifest
himself unto them—

19 *Showing his body unto them,
and ministering unto them; and
an account of his ministry shall be
given hereafter. Therefore for this
time I make an end of my sayings.

Jesus Christ did show himself unto
the people of Nephi, as the multi-
tude were gathered together in the
land Bountiful, and did minister
unto them; and on this wise did he
show himself unto them.

Comprising chapters 11 through 26.

CHAPTER 11

The Father testifies of His Beloved
Son—Christ appears and proclaims
His Atonement—The people feel the
wound marks in His hands and feet
and side—They cry Hosanna—He sets
forth the mode and manner of baptism
—The spirit of contention is of the
devil—Christ’s doctrine is that men
should believe and be baptized and re-
ceive the Holy Ghost. About A.D. 34.

AND now it came to pass that there
were a great multitude “gathered
together, of the people of Nephi,
round about the temple which was
in the land "Bountiful; and they
were marveling and wondering one
with another, and were showing one
to another the ‘great and marvel-
ous change which had taken place.

2 And they were also conversing
about this Jesus Christ, of whom
the “sign had been given concern-
ing his death.

3 And it came to pass that while
they were thus conversing one with
another, they heard a “voice as if it
came out of heaven; and they cast
their eyes round about, for they
understood not the voice which
they heard; and it was not a harsh
voice, neither was it a loud voice;
nevertheless, and notwithstanding
it being a ’small voice it did ‘pierce
them that did hear to the center,
insomuch that there was no part
of their frame that it did not cause
to quake; yea, it did pierce them to
the very soul, and did cause their
hearts to burn.

4 And it came to pass that again
they heard the voice, and they “un-
derstood it not.

5 And again the third time they did
hear the voice, and did “open their
ears to hear it; and their eyes were
towards the sound thereof; and they
did look steadfastly towards heaven,
from whence the sound came.

6 And behold, the third time they
did understand the voice which
they heard; and it said unto them:

7 Behold my “Beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased, in whom
I have glorified my name—hear
ye him.

8 And it came to pass, as they un-
derstood they cast their eyes up
again towards heaven; and behold,
they “saw a Man *descending out
of heaven; and he was clothed ina
white robe; and he came down and
stood in the midst of them; and the
eyes of the whole multitude were
turned upon him, and they durst
not open their mouths, even one to

 

428

another, and wist not what it meant,
for they thought it was an angel that
had appeared unto them.

9 And it came to pass that he
stretched forth his hand and spake
unto the people, saying:

10 Behold, lam Jesus Christ, whom
the prophets testified shall come
into the world.

11 And behold, I am the “light
and the life of the world; and I
have drunk out of that bitter ’cup
which the Father hath given me, and
have glorified the Father in ‘taking
upon me the sins of the world, in
the which I have suffered the “will
of the Father in all things from the
beginning.

12 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had spoken these words the
whole multitude “fell to the earth;
for they remembered that it had
been ’prophesied among them
that Christ should ‘show himself
unto them after his ascension into
heaven.

13 And it came to pass that the
*Lord spake unto them saying:

14 Arise and come forth unto me,
that ye may “thrust your hands
into my side, and also that ye may
’feel the prints of the nails in my
hands and in my feet, that ye may
know that I am the ‘God of Israel,
and the God of the whole “earth,
and have been slain for the sins of
the world.

15 And it came to pass that the
multitude went forth, and thrust
their hands into his side, and “did
feel the prints of the nails in his
hands and in his feet; and this they

did do, going forth one by one un-
til they had all gone forth, and did
see with their eyes and did feel
with their hands, and did know of
a surety and did bear record, that
it was he, of whom it was written
by the prophets, that should come.

16 And when they had all gone
forth and had witnessed for them-
selves, they did cry out with one
accord, saying:

17 Hosanna! Blessed be the name
of the Most High God! And they did
fall down at the feet of Jesus, and
did “worship him.

18 And it came to pass that he
spake unto “Nephi (for Nephi was
among the multitude) and he com-
manded him that he should come
forth.

19 And Nephi arose and went forth,
and “bowed himself before the Lord
and did °kiss his feet.

20 And the Lord commanded him
that he should Zarise. And he arose
and stood before him.

21 And the Lord said unto him: I
give unto you “power that ye shall
*baptize this people when I am again
ascended into heaven.

22 And again the Lord called “oth-
ers, and said unto them likewise;
and he gave unto them power to
baptize. And he said unto them: On
this wise shall ye baptize; and there
shall be *no disputations among you.

23 Verily Lsay unto you, that whoso
repenteth of his sins through your
«words, and ’desireth to be baptized

 

3 NEPHI 11:16-30

in my name, on this wise shall ye
baptize them—Behold, ye shall go
down and ‘stand in the water, and
in my name shall ye baptize them.

24 And now behold, these are the
words which ye shall say, calling
them by name, saying:

25 Having “authority given me of
Jesus Christ, | baptize you in the
name of the "Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

26 And then shall ye “immerse
them in the water, and come forth
again out of the water.

27 And after this manner shall ye
“baptize in my name; for behold, ver-
ily I say unto you, that the Father,
and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are
bone; and I am in the Father, and
the Father in me, and the Father
and I are one.

28 And according as I have com-
manded you thus shall ye baptize.
And there shall be no “disputations
among you, as there have hitherto
been; neither shall there be dispu-
tations among you concerning the
points of my doctrine, as there have
hitherto been.

29 For verily, verily Lsay unto you,

tion is not of me, but is of the °devil,
who is the father of contention, and

to contend with anger, one with

31 Behold, verily, verily, I say
unto you, I will declare unto you
my “doctrine.

32 And this is my “doctrine, and
it is the doctrine which the Father
hath given unto me; and I bear
’record of the Father, and the Father
beareth record of me, and the “Holy
Ghost beareth record of the Father
and me; and I bear record that the
Father commandeth all men, every-
where, to repent and believe in me.

33 And whoso believeth in me,
and is “baptized, the same shall be
’saved; and they are they who shall
‘inherit the kingdom of God.

34 And whoso believeth not in
me, and is not “baptized, shall be
damned.

35 Verily, verily, | say unto you,
that this is my doctrine, and I bear
record of it from the Father; and
whoso “believeth in me believeth
in the Father also; and unto him
will the Father bear record of me,
for he will visit him °with fire and
with the ‘Holy Ghost.

36 And thus will the Father bear
record of me, and the “Holy Ghost
will bear record unto him of the
Father and me; for the Father, and
I, and the Holy Ghost are "one.

37 And again I say unto you, ye
must repent, and “become as a “little
child, and be baptized in my name,
or ye can in nowise receive these
things.

38 And again I say unto you, ye

that this is my “doctrine, and whoso
’buildeth upon this buildeth upon
my rock, and the ‘gates of hell shall
not prevail against them.

40 And whoso shall ¢declare more
or less than this, and establish it
for my doctrine, the same cometh
of evil, and is not built upon my
rock; but he buildeth upon a ’sandy
foundation, and the gates of hell
stand open to receive such when
the floods come and the winds beat
upon them.

people, and declare the words which
I have spoken, unto the ends of

Jesus calls and commissions the twelve
disciples—He delivers to the Nephites a

Mount—He speaks the Beatitudes—His

and His Father are perfect—Compare

and cried unto them, saying: “Blessed
are ye if ye shall give heed unto the
words of these twelve whom I have
‘chosen from among you to minis-
ter unto you, and to be your ser-
vants; and unto them I have given
power that they may baptize you
with water; and after that ye are
baptized with water, behold, I will
baptize you with fire and with the
Holy Ghost; therefore blessed are
ye if ye shall believe in me and be
baptized, after that ye have seen me
and know that I am.

2 And again, more blessed are they
who shall “believe in your words
because that ye shall testify that
ye have seen me, and that ye know
that Lam. Yea, blessed are they who
shall "believe in your ‘words, and
4come down into the depths of hu-
mility and be baptized, for they
shall be visited ‘with fire and with
the Holy Ghost, and shall receive a
remission of their sins.

3 Yea, blessed are the “poor in spirit
who ’come unto me, for theirs is
the kingdom of heaven.

4 And again, blessed are all they that
“mourn, for they shall be ’comforted.

5 And blessed are the *meek, for
they shall inherit the "earth.

6 And blessed are all they who
do “hunger and "thirst after ‘righ-
teousness, for they shall be “filled
with the Holy Ghost.

7 And blessed are the “merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy.

 

3 NEPHI 12:2-17

8 And blessed are all the “pure in
heart, for they shall "see God.

9 And blessed are all the “peace-
makers, for they shall be called the
’children of God.

10 And blessed are all they who
are “persecuted for my name’s sake,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

11 And blessed are ye when men
shall ¢revile you and persecute, and
shall say all manner of evil against
you falsely, for my sake;

12 For “ye shall have great joy and
be exceedingly glad, for great shall
be your "reward in heaven; for so
‘persecuted they the prophets who
were before you.

13 Verily, verily, | say unto you, I
give unto you to be the “salt of the
earth; but if the salt shall lose its
savor wherewith shall the earth be
salted? The salt shall be thenceforth
good for nothing, but to be cast out
and to be trodden under foot of men.

14 Verily, verily, | say unto you, I
give unto you to be the light of this
people. A city that is set on a hill
cannot be hid.

15 Behold, do men light a “candle
and put it under a bushel? Nay, but
on acandlestick, and it giveth light
to all that are in the house;

16 Therefore let your “light so
shine before this people, that they
may see your good works and "’glo-
rify your Father who is in heaven.

17 Think not that I am come to
destroy the law or the prophets.

I am not come to destroy but to
fulfil;

18 For verily I say unto you, “one
jot nor one tittle hath not passed
away from the “law, but in me it
hath all been fulfilled.

19 And behold, I have given you
the law and the commandments
of my Father, that ye shall believe
in me, and that ye shall repent of
your sins, and come unto me witha
“broken heart and a contrite spirit.
Behold, ye have the command-
ments before you, and the "law is
fulfilled.

20 Therefore “come unto me and
be ye saved; for verily I say unto
you, that except ye shall keep my
’commandments, which I have com-
manded you at this time, ye shall
in no case enter into the kingdom
of heaven,

21 Ye have heard that it hath been
said by them of old time, and it is
also written before you, that thou
shalt not “kill, and whosoever shall
kill shall be in danger of the judg-
ment of God;

22 But I say unto you, that whoso-
ever is “angry with his brother shall
be in danger of his judgment. And
whosoever shall say to his brother,
Raca, shall be in danger of the
council; and whosoever shall say,
Thou fool, shall be in danger of
hell fire.

23 Therefore, “if ye shall come
unto me, or shall desire to come
unto me, and rememberest that thy
brother hath aught against thee—

24 Gothy way unto thy brother, and
first be “reconciled to thy brother,

 

432

and then come unto me with full
’ourpose of heart, and I will re-
ceive you.

25 “Agree with thine adversary
quickly while thou art in the way
with him, lest at any time he shall
get thee, and thou shalt be cast into
prison.

26 Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
thou shalt by no means come out
thence until thou hast paid the ut-
termost senine. And while ye are in
prison can ye pay even one “senine?
Verily, verily, | say unto you, Nay.

27 Behold, it is written by them of
old time, that thou shalt not com-
mit “adultery;

28 But Isay unto you, that whoso-
ever looketh on a woman, to “lust
after her, hath committed adultery
already in his heart.

29 Behold, I give unto you a com-
mandment, that ye suffer “none
of these things to enter into your
bheart;

30 For it is better that ye should
deny yourselves of these things,
wherein ye will take up your “cross,
than that ye should be cast into
hell.

31 It hath been written, that whoso-
ever shall put away his wife, let him
give her a writing of “divorcement.

32 Verily, verily, | say unto you,
that whosoever shall “put away his
wife, saving for the cause of *for-
nication, causeth her to commit
‘adultery; and whoso shall marry
her who is divorced committeth
adultery.

shalt not “*forswear thyself, but

shalt *perform unto the Lord thine
‘oaths;

34 But verily, verily, I say unto
you, “swear not at all; neither by
heaven, for it is God’s throne;

35 Nor by the earth, for it is his
footstool,

36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy
head, because thou canst not make
one hair black or white;

37 But let your “communication be
’Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever
cometh of more than these is evil.

38 And behold, it is written, an “eye
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;

39 But I say unto you, that ye shall
not “resist evil, but whosoever shall
smite thee on thy right °cheek, ‘turn
to him the other also;

40 And if any man will sue thee at
the law and take away thy coat, “let
him have thy cloak also;

41 And whosoever shall compel
thee to “goa mile, go with him twain.

42 “Give to him that asketh thee,
and from him that would "borrow
of thee turn thou not away.

43 And behold it is written also,
that thou shalt love thy neighbor and
hate thine enemy;

44 But behold I say unto you, love
your “enemies, bless them that curse
you, do good to them that hate you,
and ‘pray for them who despitefully
use you and persecute you;

45 That ye may be the children of
your Father who is in heaven; for
he maketh his sun to rise “on the
evil and on the good.

3 NEPHI 12:34-13:5

46 Therefore those things which
were of old time, which were un-
der the law, in me are all “fulfilled.

47 “Old things are done away, and
all things have become °new.

48 Therefore I would that ye should
be “perfect even as I, or your Father
who is in heaven is perfect.

CHAPTER 13

Jesus teaches the Nephites the Lord’s
Prayer—tThey are to lay up treasures in
heaven—The twelve disciples in their
ministry are commanded to take no
thought for temporal things—Compare
Matthew 6. About A.D. 34.

"VERILY, verily, I say that I would
that ye should do alms unto the
poor; but take heed that ye do not
your alms before men to be seen of
them; otherwise ye have no reward
of your Father who is in heaven.

2 Therefore, when ye shall do your
alms do not sound a trumpet before
you, as will hypocrites do in the
synagogues and in the streets, that
they may have “glory of men. Ver-
ily I say unto you, they have their
reward.

3 But when thou doest alms let
not thy left hand know what thy
right hand doeth;

4 That thine alms may be in se-
cret; and thy Father who seeth in
secret, himself shall reward thee
openly.

shalt not do as the "hypocrites, for

they love to pray, standing in the
synagogues and in the corners of
the streets, that they may be seen
of men. Verily I say unto you, they
have their reward.

6 But thou, when thou prayest,
enter into thy closet, and when
thou hast “shut thy door, pray to
thy Father who is in secret; and thy
Father, who ’seeth in secret, shall
reward thee openly.

7 But when ye pray, use not “vain
repetitions, as the "heathen, for they
think that they shall be heard for
their much speaking.

8 Be not ye therefore like unto
them, for your Father “knoweth
what things ye have need of before
ye ’ask him.

9 After this “manner therefore
’oray ye: Our ‘Father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

10 Thy will be done on earth as it
is in heaven.

11 And forgive us our debts, as we
forgive our debtors.

12 And “lead us not into tempta-
tion, but deliver us from evil.

13 For thine is the kingdom, and the
power, and the glory, forever. Amen.

14 For, if ye “forgive men their
trespasses your heavenly Father
will also forgive you;

15 But if ye forgive not men their
trespasses neither will your Father
forgive your trespasses.

16 Moreover, when ye “fast be not
as the "hypocrites, of a sad counte-
nance, for they disfigure their faces
that they may appear unto men to
fast. Verily Lsay unto you, they have
their reward.

 

434

17 But thou, when thou fastest,
anoint thy head, and “wash thy face;

18 That thou appear not unto
men to fast, but unto thy Father, who
is in “secret; and thy Father, who
seeth in secret, shall reward thee
openly.

19 Lay not up for yourselves trea-
sures upon earth, where “moth and
rust doth corrupt, and thieves break
through and steal;

20 But lay up for yourselves “trea-
sures in heaven, where neither moth
nor rust doth corrupt, and where
thieves do not break through nor
steal.

21 For where your treasure is, there
will your heart be also.

22 The “light of the body is the "eye;
if, therefore, thine eye be ‘single,
thy whole body shall be full of
light.

23 But if thine eye be evil, thy
whole body shall be full of dark-
ness. If, therefore, the light that is in
thee be darkness, how great is that
darkness!

24 No man can 4serve "two masters;
for either he will hate the one and
love the other, or else he will hold
to the one and despise the other.
Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.

25 And now it came to pass that
when Jesus had spoken these words
he looked upon the “twelve whom
he had chosen, and said unto them:
Remember the words which I have
spoken. For behold, ye are they
whom I have chosen to °minister
unto this people. Therefore I say
unto you, ‘take no thought for your
life, what ye shall eat, or what ye

shall drink; nor yet for your body,
what ye shall put on. Is not the life
more than meat, and the body than
4raiment?

26 Behold the “fowls of the air,
for they sow not, neither do they
reap nor gather into barns; yet your
heavenly Father feedeth them. Are
ye not much better than they?

27 Which of you by taking thought
can add one cubit unto his stature?

28 And why take ye thought for
raiment? Consider the lilies of the
field how they grow; they toil not,
neither do they spin;

29 And yet I say unto you, that
even Solomon, in all his glory, was
not arrayed like one of these.

30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the
grass of the field, which today is,
and tomorrow is cast into the oven,
even so will he clothe you, if ye are
not of little faith.

31 Therefore take no thought, say-
ing, What shall we eat? or, What
shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall
we be clothed?

32 For your heavenly Father know-
eth that ye have need of all these
things.

33 But ‘seek ye first the "kingdom
of God and his righteousness, and
all these things shall be added
unto you.

34 Take therefore no thought for
the morrow, for the morrow shall
take thought for the things of it-
self. “Sufficient is the day unto the
evil thereof.

CHAPTER 14

Jesus commands: Judge not; ask of God;
beware of false prophets—He prom-
ises salvation to those who do the will
of the Father—Compare Matthew 7.
About A.D. 34.

2AND now it came to pass that when

 

3 NEPHI 13:26-14:12

Jesus had spoken these words he
turned again to the multitude,
and did open his mouth unto them
again, saying: Verily, verily, I say
unto you, Judge not, that ye be not
judged.

2 “For with what judgment ye
judge, ye shall be judged; and with
what measure ye mete, it shall be
measured to you again.

3 And why beholdest thou the
mote that is in thy brother’s eye,
but considerest not the beam that
is in thine own eye?

4 Or how wilt thou say to thy
brother: Let me pull the mote out
of thine eye—and behold, a beam
is in thine own eye?

5 Thou “hypocrite, first cast the
beam out of thine own eye; and
then shalt thou see clearly to cast the
mote out of thy brother’s eye.

6 Give not that which is “holy
unto the dogs, neither cast ye your
pearls before swine, lest they tram-
ple them under their feet, and turn
again and rend you.

7 “Ask, and it shall be given unto
you; "seek, and ye shall find; knock,
and it shall be opened unto you.

8 For every one that asketh, receiv-
eth; and he that seeketh, findeth;
and to him that knocketh, it shall
be opened.

9 Or what man is there of you,
who, if his son ask bread, will give
him a stone?

10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give
him a serpent?

11 If ye then, being evil, know how
to give good gifts unto your chil-
dren, how much more shall your
Father who is in heaven give good
things to them that ask him?

12 Therefore, all things whatsoever
ye would that men should do to
you, “do ye even so to them, for this
is the law and the prophets.

13 Enter ye in at the “strait gate;
for wide is the gate, and "broad is
the way, which leadeth to destruc-
tion, and many there be who go in
thereat;

14 Because strait is the “gate, and
’narrow is the way, which leadeth
unto life, and ‘few there be that
find it.

15 Beware of “false prophets, who
come to you in sheep’s clothing, but
inwardly they are ravening wolves.

16 Ye shall know them by their
“fruits. Do men gather grapes of
thorns, or figs of thistles?

17 Even so every “good tree bring-
eth forth good fruit; but a corrupt
tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

18 A good tree cannot bring forth
evil fruit, neither a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit.

19 Every tree that “bringeth not
forth good fruit is hewn down, and
cast into the fire.

20 Wherefore, by their “fruits ye
shall know them.

21 Not every one that saith unto
me, Lord, Lord, shall “enter into
the kingdom of heaven; but he that
doeth the will of my Father who is
in heaven.

22 Many will say to me in that day:
Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
in thy name, and in thy name have
cast out devils, and in thy name
done many wonderful works?

23 And then will “I profess unto
them: I never ’knew you; ‘depart
from me, ye that work iniquity.

24 Therefore, whoso heareth these
sayings of mine and doeth them,

 

436

I will liken him unto a wise man,
who built his house upon a “rock—

25 And the “rain descended, and
the floods came, and the winds blew,
and beat upon that house; and it
’fell not, for it was founded upon
a rock,

26 And every one that heareth
these sayings of mine and doeth
them not shall be likened unto a
“foolish man, who built his house
upon the ’sand—

27 And the rain descended, and
the floods came, and the winds
blew, and beat upon that house; and
it fell, and great was the fall of it.

CHAPTER 15

Jesus announces that the law of Moses
is fulfilled in Him—The Nephites are
the other sheep of whom He spoke in
Jerusalem—Because of iniquity, the
Lord’s people in Jerusalem do not know
of the scattered sheep of Israel. About
A.D. 34.

AND now it came to pass that when
Jesus had ended these sayings he
cast his eyes round about on the
multitude, and said unto them:
Behold, ye have heard the things
which I “taught before I ascended
to my Father; therefore, whoso re-
membereth these sayings of mine
and ’doeth them, him will I ‘raise
up at the last day.

2 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had said these words he per-
ceived that there were some among
them who marveled, and wondered
what he would concerning the law

of Moses; for they understood not
the saying that “old things had
passed away, and that all things
had become new.

3 And he said unto them: Marvel
not that I said unto you that old
things had passed away, and that
all things had become “new.

4 Behold, I say unto you that the
“Jaw is fulfilled that was given unto
Moses.

5 Behold, “I am he that gave the
law, and I am he who covenanted
with my people Israel; therefore,
the law in me is fulfilled, for I have
come to >fulfil the law; therefore it
hath an end.

6 Behold, I do “not destroy the
prophets, for as many as have not
been fulfilled in me, verily lsay unto
you, shall all be fulfilled.

7 And because I said unto you that
old things have passed away, I do not
destroy that which hath been spoken
concerning things which are to come.

8 For behold, the “covenant which
I have made with my people is not
all fulfilled; but the law which was
given unto Moses hath an end in me.

9 Behold, I am the “law, and the
‘light. Look unto me, and endure to
the end, and ye shall ‘live; for unto
him that “endureth to the end will
I give eternal life.

10 Behold, I have given unto you
the “commandments; therefore keep
my commandments. And this is the
law and the prophets, for they truly
testified of me.

 

3 NEPHI 15:3-19

11 And now it came to pass that
when Jesus had spoken these words,
he “said unto those twelve whom
he had chosen:

12 Ye are my “disciples; and ye are
a light unto this people, who are a
remnant of the house of ‘Joseph.

13 And behold, this is the “land of
your inheritance; and the Father
hath given it unto you.

14 And not at any time hath the
Father given me commandment that
I should tell it unto your brethren
at Jerusalem.

15 Neither at any time hath the
Father given me commandment that
I should tell unto them concerning
the “other tribes of the house of
Israel, whom the Father hath led
away out of the land.

16 This much did the Father *com-
mand me, that I should tell unto
them:

17 That other sheep I have which
are not of this fold; them also I
must bring, and they shall hear my
voice; and there shall be one fold,
and one “shepherd.

18 And now, because of ¢stiff-
neckedness and °unbelief they ‘un-
derstood not my word; therefore I
was commanded to say no more of
the “Father concerning this thing
unto them.

19 But, verily, lsay unto you that
the Father hath commanded me,
and I tell it unto you, that ye were
“separated from among them be-
cause of their iniquity; therefore it

is because of their iniquity that
they know not of you.

20 And verily, lsay unto you again
that the other tribes hath the Father
separated from them; and it is be-
cause of their iniquity that they
know not of them.

21 And verily I say unto you, that
ye are they of whom I said: “Other
sheep I have which are not of this
fold; them also I must bring, and
they shall hear my voice; and there
shall be one fold, and one "shepherd.

22 And they understood me not,
for they supposed it had been the
"Gentiles; for they understood not
that the Gentiles should be "con-
verted through their preaching.

23 And they understood me not
that I said they shall hear my voice;
and they understood me not that
the “Gentiles should not at any time
hear my voice—that I should not
manifest myself unto them save it
were by the "Holy Ghost.

24 But behold, ye have both heard
4my voice, and seen me; and ye are
my sheep, and ye are numbered
among those whom the Father hath
’siven me.

CHAPTER 16

Jesus will visit others of the lost sheep
of Israel—tin the latter days the gospel
will go to the Gentiles and then to the
house of Israel—The Lord’s people will
see eye to eye when He brings again
Zion. About A.D. 34.

AND verily, verily, I say unto you
that I have “other sheep, which are
not of this land, neither of the land

 

438

of Jerusalem, neither in any parts
of that land round about whither
I have been to minister.

2 For they of whom I speak are
they who have not as yet heard my
voice; neither have I at any time
manifested myself unto them.

3 But [have received a “command-
ment of the Father that I shall go
unto them, and that they shall "hear
my voice, and shall be numbered
among my sheep, that there may be
one fold and one shepherd; there-
fore I go to show myself unto them.

4 And I command you that ye shall
*write these sayings after lam gone,
that if it so be that my people at
Jerusalem, they who have seen me
and been with me in my ministry,
do not ask the Father in my name,
that they may receive a knowledge
of you by the Holy Ghost, and also
of the other tribes whom they know
not of, that these sayings which ye
shall write shall be kept and shall
be manifested unto the °Gentiles,
that through the fulness of the Gen-
tiles, the remnant of their seed, who
shall be scattered forth upon the
face of the earth because of their
‘unbelief, may be brought in, or
may be brought to a “knowledge
of me, their Redeemer.

5 And then will 1 ¢gather them in
from the four quarters of the earth;
and then will I fulfil the ’covenant
which the Father hath made unto
all the people of the ‘house of Israel.

6 And blessed are the “Gentiles,
because of their belief in me, in and
of the Holy Ghost, which witnesses
unto them of me and of the Father.

7 Behold, because of their belief
in me, saith the Father, and because
of the unbelief of you, O house of
Israel, in the “latter day shall the
truth come unto the Gentiles, that
the fulness of these things shall be
made known unto them.

8 But wo, saith the Father, unto the
“unbelieving of the Gentiles—for
notwithstanding they have come
forth upon the face of this land,
and have ’scattered my people who
are of the house of Israel; and my
people who are of the house of Is-
rael have been ‘cast out from among
them, and have been trodden under
feet by them;

9 And because of the mercies of the
Father unto the Gentiles, and also
the judgments of the Father upon
my people who are of the house of
Israel, verily, verily, lsay unto you,
that after all this, and I have caused
my people who are of the house of
Israel to be smitten, and to be af-
flicted, and to be “slain, and to be
cast out from among them, and to
become "hated by them, and to be-
come a hiss and a byword among
them—

10 And thus commandeth the
Father that I should say unto you:
At that day when the Gentiles shall
4sin against my gospel, and shall re-
ject the fulness of my gospel, and
shall be “lifted up in the pride of
their hearts above all nations, and
above all the people of the whole
earth, and shall be filled with all
manner of lyings, and of deceits,
and of mischiefs, and all manner

 

3 NEPHI 16:7-16

of hypocrisy, and “murders, and
4priestcrafts, and whoredoms, and
of secret abominations; and if they
shall do all those things, and shall
“reject the fulness of my gospel,
behold, saith the Father, I will
bring the fulness of my gospel from
among them.

11 And then will 1¢remember my
covenant which I have made unto
my people, O house of Israel, and
I will bring my gospel unto them.

12 And I will show unto thee, O
house of Israel, that the Gentiles
shall not have power over you; but
I will remember my covenant unto
you, O house of Israel, and ye shall
come unto the “knowledge of the
fulness of my gospel.

13 But if the Gentiles will repent
and return unto me, saith the
Father, behold they shall be ¢“num-
bered among my people, O house
of Israel.

14 And I will not suffer my people,
who are of the house of Israel, to
go through among them, and tread
them down, saith the Father.

15 But if they will not turn unto
me, and hearken unto my voice, I
will suffer them, yea, I will suffer
my people, O house of Israel, that
they shall go through among them,
and shall “tread them down, and
they shall be as salt that hath lost
its savor, which is thenceforth good
for nothing but to be cast out, and
to be trodden under foot of my
people, O house of Israel.

people this land for their inheri-
tance.

17 And then the “words of the
prophet Isaiah shall be fulfilled,
which say:

18 ¢Thy ’watchmen shall lift up
the voice; with the voice together
shall they sing, for they shall see
eye to eye when the Lord shall bring
again Zion.

CHAPTER 17

Jesus directs the people to ponder His
words and pray for understanding—
He heals their sick—He prays for the
people, using language that cannot be
written—Angels minister to and fire
encircles their little ones. About A.D. 34.

BEHOLD, now it came to pass that
when Jesus had spoken these words
he looked round about again on the
multitude, and he said unto them:
Behold, my “time is at hand.

21 “perceive that ye are weak,
that ye cannot ’understand all my
words which | am commanded of
the Father to speak unto you at
this time.

3 Therefore, go ye unto your homes,
and “ponder upon the things which
Lhave said, and ask of the Father, in
my name, that ye may understand,

 

440

and "prepare your minds for the
“morrow, and I come unto you again.

4 But now I “go unto the Father,
and also to show myself unto the
lost tribes of Israel, for they are not
‘lost unto the Father, for he knoweth
whither he hath taken them.

5 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his
eyes round about again on the
multitude, and beheld they were
“in tears, and did look steadfastly
upon him as if they would ask
him to tarry a little longer with
them.

6 And he said unto them: Behold,
my bowels are filled with “compas-
sion towards you.

7 Have ye any that are “sick among
you? Bring them hither. Have ye
any that are lame, or blind, or halt,
or maimed, or "leprous, or that are
withered, or that are deaf, or that
are afflicted in any manner? Bring
them hither and I will ‘heal them,
for 1 have compassion upon you;
my bowels are filled with mercy.

8 For I perceive that ye desire that
Ishould show unto you what I have
done unto your brethren at Jeru-
salem, for I see that your “faith is
’sufficient that I should heal you.

9 And it came to pass that when he
had thus spoken, all the multitude,
with one accord, did go forth with
their sick and their afflicted, and
their lame, and with their “blind,
and with their dumb, and with all
them that were afflicted in any
manner; and he did heal them ev-
ery one as they were brought forth
unto him.

10 And they did all, both they who
had been healed and they who were
whole, bow down at his feet, and
did worship him; and as many as
could come for the multitude did
*kiss his feet, insomuch that they
did bathe his feet with their tears.

11 And it came to pass that he
commanded that their “little chil-
dren should be brought.

12 So they brought their little
children and set them down upon
the ground round about him, and
Jesus stood in the midst; and the
multitude gave way till they had
all been brought unto him.

13 And it came to pass that when
they had all been brought, and Jesus
stood in the midst, he commanded
the multitude that they should
“kneel down upon the ground.

14 And it came to pass that when
they had knelt upon the ground,
Jesus groaned within himself, and
said: Father, lam “troubled because
of the wickedness of the people of
the house of Israel.

15 And when he had said these
words, he himself also “knelt upon
the earth; and behold he ’prayed
unto the Father, and the things
which he prayed cannot be written,
and the multitude did bear record
who heard him.

16 And after this manner do they
bear record: The “eye hath never
seen, neither hath the ear heard,
before, so great and marvelous
things as we saw and heard Jesus
speak unto the Father;

17 And no “tongue can speak, nei-
ther can there be written by any
man, neither can the hearts of men
conceive so great and marvelous
things as we both saw and heard

 

3 NEPHI 17:10-25

Jesus speak; and no one can conceive
of the joy which filled our souls at
the time we heard him pray for us
unto the Father.

18 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had made an end of praying
unto the Father, he arose; but so
great was the “joy of the multitude
that they were overcome.

19 And it came to pass that Jesus
spake unto them, and bade them
arise.

20 And they arose from the earth,
and he said unto them: Blessed are
ye because of your faith. And “now
behold, my joy is full.

21 And when he had said these
words, he “wept, and the multitude
bare record of it, and he took their
little children, one by one, and
’blessed them, and prayed unto the
Father for them.

22 And when he had done this he
wept again;

23 And he spake unto the multi-
tude, and said unto them: Behold
your little ones.

24 And as they looked to behold
they cast their eyes towards heaven,
and they saw the heavens open, and
they saw angels descending out of
heaven as it were in the midst of fire;
and they came down and “encircled
those little ones about, and they
were encircled about with fire; and
the angels did minister unto them.

25 And the multitude did see and
*hear and bear record; and they
know that their record is true for
they all of them did see and hear,
every man for himself; and they
were in number about two thou-
sand and five hundred souls; and
they did consist of men, women,
and children.

CHAPTER 18

Jesus institutes the sacrament among
the Nephites—They are commanded to
pray always in His name—Those who
eat His flesh and drink His blood un-
worthily are damned—tThe disciples are
given power to confer the Holy Ghost.
About A.D. 34.

AND it came to pass that Jesus com-
manded his disciples that they
should bring forth some “bread and
wine unto him.

2 And while they were gone for
bread and wine, he commanded
the multitude that they should sit
themselves down upon the earth.

3 And when the disciples had come
with “bread and wine, he took of
the bread and brake and blessed it;
and he gave unto the disciples and
commanded that they should eat.

4 And when they had eaten and
were filled, he commanded that
they should give unto the multitude.

5 And when the multitude had
eaten and were filled, he said unto
the disciples: Behold there shall one
be “ordained among you, and to
him will I give power that he shall
>break “bread and bless it and give
it unto the people of my ¢church,
unto all those who shall believe and
be baptized in my name.

6 And this shall ye always observe
to ¢do, even as I have done, even as
I have broken bread and blessed it
and given it unto you.

7 And this shall ye do in “remem-
brance of my body, which I have
shown unto you. And it shall be
a testimony unto the Father that
ye do always remember me. And if ye
do always remember me ye shall
have my Spirit to be with you.

8 And it came to pass that when

 

442

he said these words, he commanded
his disciples that they should take
of the “wine of the cup and drink
of it, and that they should also give
unto the multitude that they might
drink of it.

9 And it came to pass that they
did so, and did drink of it and were
filled; and they gave unto the mul-
titude, and they did drink, and they
were filled.

10 And when the disciples had
done this, Jesus said unto them:
Blessed are ye for this thing which
ye have done, for this is fulfilling
my commandments, and this doth
witness unto the Father that ye are
*willing to do that which I have
commanded you.

11 And this shall ye always do to
those who repent and are baptized
in my name; and ye shall do it in
“remembrance of my "blood, which
I have shed for you, that ye may
witness unto the Father that ye do
always remember me. And if ye
do always remember me ye shall
have my Spirit to be with you.

12 And I give unto you a com-
mandment that ye shall do these
things. And if ye shall always do
these things blessed are ye, for ye
are built upon my “rock.

13 But whoso among you shall
do “more or less than these are not
built upon my rock, but are built
upon a sandy foundation; and when
the rain descends, and the floods
come, and the winds blow, and beat
upon them, they shall ’fall, and the
‘gates of hell are ready open to re-
ceive them.

14 Therefore blessed are ye if ye
shall keep my commandments,
which the Father hath commanded
me that I should give unto you.

be led away captive by him.

16 And as I have prayed among
you even so shall ye pray in my
“church, among my people who
do repent and are baptized in my
name. Behold Iam the “light; I have
set an ‘example for you.

17 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had spoken these words unto
his disciples, he turned again unto
the multitude and said unto them:

18 Behold, verily, verily, lsay unto
you, ye must watch and pray always
lest ye enter into temptation; for
“Satan desireth to have you, that
he may sift you as wheat.

19 Therefore ye must always pray
unto the Father in my name;

20 And ¢whatsoever ye shall ask
the Father in my name, which is
right, believing that ye shall receive,
behold it shall be given unto you.

21 *Pray in your families unto the
Father, always in my name, that
your wives and your children may
be blessed.

22 And behold, ye shall *meet to-
gether oft; and ye shall not forbid
any man from coming unto you
when ye shall meet together, but
suffer them that they may come
unto you and forbid them not;

23 But ye shall “pray for them, and
shall not cast them out; and if it so
be that they come unto you oft ye
shall pray for them unto the Father,
in my name.

24 Therefore, hold up your “light

 

3 NEPHI 18:15-30

that it may shine unto the world.
Behold I am the "light which ye
shall hold up—that which ye have
seen me do. Behold ye see that I
have prayed unto the Father, and
ye all have witnessed.

25 And ye see that I have com-
manded that @none of you should go
away, but rather have commanded
that ye should come unto me, that
ye might ’feel and see; even so shall
ye do unto the world; and whoso-
ever breaketh this commandment
suffereth himself to be led into
temptation.

26 And now it came to pass that
when Jesus had spoken these words,
he turned his eyes again upon the
“disciples whom he had chosen, and
said unto them:

27 Behold verily, verily, lsay unto
you, I give unto you another com-
mandment, and then I must go
unto my “Father that I may fulfil
bother commandments which he
hath given me.

28 And now behold, this is the
commandment which I give unto
you, that ye shall not suffer any
one knowingly to “partake of my
flesh and blood "unworthily, when
ye shall minister it;

29 For whoso eateth and drinketh
my flesh and “blood 'unworthily
eateth and drinketh damnation to
his soul; therefore if ye know that
aman is unworthy to eat and drink
of my flesh and blood ye shall for-
bid him.

30 Nevertheless, ye shall not “cast
him out from among you, but ye

shall ’minister unto him and shall
pray for him unto the Father, in
my name; and if it so be that he re-
penteth and is baptized in my name,
then shall ye receive him, and shall
minister unto him of my flesh and
blood.

31 But if he repent not he shall
not be numbered among my people,
that he may not destroy my people,
for behold I “know 'my sheep, and
they are numbered.

32 Nevertheless, ye shall not cast
him out of your “synagogues, or
your places of worship, for unto
such shall ye continue to minister;
for ye know not but what they will
return and repent, and come unto
me with full purpose of heart, and
I shall "heal them; and ye shall be
the means of bringing salvation
unto them.

33 Therefore, keep these sayings
which I have commanded you that
ye come not under “condemnation;
for wo unto him whom the Father
condemneth.

34 And I give you these command-
ments because of the disputations
which have been among you. And
blessed are ye if ye have “no dispu-
tations among you.

35 And now I go unto the Father,
because it is expedient that I should
go unto the Father “for your sakes.

36 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had made an end of these say-
ings, he touched with his “hand the
’disciples whom he had chosen, one
by one, even until he had touched
them all, and spake unto them as
he touched them.

37 And the multitude heard not
the words which he spake, therefore
they did not bear record; but the
disciples bare record that he gave

 

444

them “power to give the "Holy Ghost.
And I will show unto you ‘hereafter
that this record is true.

38 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had touched them all, there
came a “cloud and overshadowed
the multitude that they could not
see Jesus.

39 And while they were overshad-
owed he “departed from them, and
ascended into heaven. And the dis-
ciples saw and did bear record that
he ascended again into heaven.

CHAPTER 19

The twelve disciples minister unto the
people and pray for the Holy Ghost—
The disciples are baptized and receive
the Holy Ghost and the ministering of
angels—Jesus prays using words that
cannot be written—He attests to the
exceedingly great faith of these Neph-
ites. About A.D. 34.

AND now it came to pass that when
Jesus had ascended into heaven,
the multitude did disperse, and
every man did take his wife and his
children and did return to his own
home.

2 And it was noised abroad among
the people immediately, before it
was yet dark, that the multitude had
seen Jesus, and that he had minis-
tered unto them, and that he would
also show himself on the *morrow
unto the multitude.

3 Yea, and even all the night it was
noised abroad concerning Jesus; and
insomuch did they send forth unto
the people that there were many,
yea, an exceedingly great number,
did labor exceedingly all that night,
that they might be on the morrow in
the place where Jesus should show
himself unto the multitude.

4 And it came to pass that on the
morrow, when the multitude was
gathered together, behold, Nephi
and his “brother whom he had raised
from the "dead, whose name was
Timothy, and also his son, whose
name was Jonas, and also Mathoni,
and Mathonihah, his brother, and
Kumen, and Kumenonhi, and Jere-
miah, and Shemnon, and Jonas,
and Zedekiah, and Isaiah—now
these were the ‘names of the @dis-
ciples whom Jesus had chosen—
and it came to pass that they went
forth and stood in the midst of the
multitude.

5 And behold, the multitude was
*s0 great that they did cause that
they should be separated into twelve
bodies.

6 And the twelve did teach the
multitude; and behold, they did
cause that the multitude should
*kneel down upon the face of the
earth, and should pray unto the
Father in the name of Jesus.

7 And the disciples did pray unto
the Father also in the name of Jesus.
And it came to pass that they arose
and ministered unto the people.

8 And when they had ministered
those same words which Jesus had
spoken—nothing varying from the
words which Jesus had spoken—be-
hold, they knelt again and prayed
to the Father in the name of Jesus.

9 And they did pray for that which
they most desired; and they desired
that the “Holy Ghost should be given
unto them.

10 And when they had thus prayed
they went down unto the water’s
edge, and the multitude followed
them.

11 And it came to pass that Nephi
went down “into the water and was
’baptized.

12 And he came up out of the

 

3 NEPHI 19:4-21

water and began to baptize. And
he baptized all those whom Jesus
had chosen.

13 And it came to pass when they
were all baptized and had come “up
out of the water, the "Holy Ghost
did fall upon them, and they were
filled with the Holy Ghost and
with fire.

14 And behold, they were ¢en-
circled about as if it were by fire;
and it came down from heaven, and
the multitude did witness it, and did
bear record; and angels did come
down out of heaven and did min-
ister unto them.

15 And it came to pass that while
the angels were ministering unto
the disciples, behold, Jesus came
and stood in the midst and minis-
tered unto them.

16 And it came to pass that he
spake unto the multitude, and
commanded them that they should
kneel down again upon the earth,
and also that his disciples should
kneel down upon the earth.

17 And it came to pass that when
they had all knelt down upon the
earth, he commanded his disciples
that they should pray.

18 And behold, they began to
pray; and they did pray unto Jesus,
calling him their Lord and their
God.

19 And it came to pass that Jesus
departed out of the midst of them,
and went a little way off from
them and “bowed himself to the
earth, and he said:

20 Father, I thank thee that thou
hast given the Holy Ghost unto these
whom I have “chosen; and it is be-
cause of their belief in me that I
have chosen them out of the world.

21 Father, I pray thee that thou wilt
give the Holy Ghost unto all them
that shall believe in their words.

22 Father, thou hast given them
the Holy Ghost because they be-
lieve in “me; and thou seest that
they believe in me because thou
hearest them, and they pray unto
me; and they pray unto me because
lam with them.

23 And now Father, I “pray unto
thee for them, and also for all those
who shall believe on their words,
that they may believe in me, that
I may be in them °’as thou, Father,
art in me, that we may be ‘one.

24 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had thus prayed unto the
Father, he came unto his disciples,
and behold, they did still continue,
without ceasing, to pray unto him;
and they did not *multiply many
words, for it was given unto them
what they should "pray, and they
were filled with desire.

25 And it came to pass that Jesus
blessed them as they did pray unto
him; and his “countenance did smile
upon them, and the light of his
’countenance did ‘shine upon them,
and behold they were as “white as
the countenance and also the gar-
ments of Jesus; and behold the
whiteness thereof did exceed all
the whiteness, yea, even there could
be nothing upon earth so white as
the whiteness thereof.

26 And Jesus said unto them: Pray
on; nevertheless they did not cease
to pray.

27 And he turned from them again,
and went a little way off and bowed
himself to the earth; and he prayed
again unto the Father, saying:

28 Father, I thank thee that thou
hast “purified those whom I have
chosen, because of their faith, and

 

446

I pray for them, and also for them
who shall believe on their words,
that they may be purified in me,
through faith on their words, even
as they are purified in me.

29 Father, I pray not for the world,
but for those whom thou hast given
me “out of the world, because of
their faith, that they may be purified
in me, that I may be in them as thou,
Father, art in me, that we may be
one, that I may be glorified in them.

30 And when Jesus had spoken
these words he came again unto
his disciples; and behold they did
pray steadfastly, without ceasing,
unto him; and he did smile upon
them again; and behold they were
4white, even as Jesus.

31 And it came to pass that he went
again a little way off and prayed
unto the Father;

32 And tongue cannot speak the
words which he prayed, neither
can be “written by man the words
which he prayed.

33 And the multitude did hear and
do bear record; and their “hearts
were open and they did understand
in their hearts the words which he
prayed.

34 Nevertheless, so great and mar-
velous were the words which he
prayed that they cannot be writ-
ten, neither can they be “uttered
by man.

35 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had made an end of praying
he came again to the disciples, and
said unto them: “So great ’faith have
I never seen among all the Jews;
wherefore I could not show unto
them so great ‘miracles, because
of their “unbelief.

CHAPTER 20

Jesus provides bread and wine miracu-
lously and again administers the sac-
rament unto the people—The remnant
of Jacob will come to the knowledge of
the Lord their God and will inherit the
Americas—Jesus is the prophet like unto
Moses, and the Nephites are children
of the prophets—Others of the Lord’s
people will be gathered to Jerusalem.
About A.D. 34.

AND it came to pass that he com-
manded the multitude that they
should “cease to "pray, and also his
disciples. And he commanded them
that they should not cease to pray
in their hearts.

2 And he commanded them that
they should arise and stand up upon
their feet. And they arose up and
stood upon their feet.

3 And it came to pass that he
“brake bread again and blessed
it, and gave to the disciples to eat.

4 And when they had eaten he com-
manded them that they should break
bread, and give unto the multitude.

5 And when they had given unto
the multitude he also gave them
wine to drink, and commanded
them that they should give unto
the multitude.

6 Now, there had been no “bread,
neither wine, brought by the dis-
ciples, neither by the multitude;

7 But he truly “gave unto them
bread to eat, and also wine to drink.

 

3 NEPHI 19:36-20:15

8 And he said unto them: He that
eateth this bread eateth of *my
body to his soul; and he that drink-
eth of this wine drinketh of my
blood to his soul; and his soul shall
never hunger nor thirst, but shall
be filled.

9 Now, when the multitude had all
eaten and drunk, behold, they were
filled with the Spirit; and they did
cry out with one voice, and gave
glory to Jesus, whom they both saw
and heard.

10 And it came to pass that when
they had all given glory unto Jesus,
he said unto them: Behold now I
finish the commandment which
the Father hath commanded me
concerning this people, who are a
remnant of the house of Israel.

11 Ye remember that I spake unto
you, and said that when the *words
of "Isaiah should be fulfilled—be-
hold they are written, ye have them
before you, therefore search them—

12 And verily, verily, I say unto
you, that when they shall be fulfilled
then is the fulfilling of the ¢cov-
enant which the Father hath made
unto his people, O house of Israel.

13 And then shall the “remnants,
which shall be ’scattered abroad
upon the face of the earth, be ‘gath-
ered in from the east and from
the west, and from the south and
from the north; and they shall be
brought to the ¢knowledge of the
Lord their God, who hath redeemed
them.

14 And the Father hath ¢com-
manded me that I should give unto
you this "land, for your inheritance.

the Gentiles do not “repent after

the "blessing which they shall re-
ceive, after they have scattered my
people—

16 Then shall ye, who are a “rem-
nant of the house of Jacob, go forth
among them; and ye shall be in the
midst of them who shall be many;
and ye shall be among them as a lion
among the beasts of the forest, and
as a young "lion among the flocks
of sheep, who, if he goeth through
both ‘treadeth down and teareth in
pieces, and none can deliver.

17 Thy hand shall be lifted up
upon thine adversaries, and all thine
enemies shall be cut off.

18 And I will “gather my people
together as a man gathereth his
sheaves into the floor.

19 For I will make my “people with
whom the Father hath covenanted,
yea, I will make thy "horn iron, and
I will make thy hoofs brass. And
thou shalt ‘beat in pieces many
people; and I will consecrate their
gain unto the Lord, and their sub-
stance unto the Lord of the whole
earth. And behold, I am he who
doeth it.

20 And it shall come to pass, saith
the Father, that the “sword of my
justice shall hang over them at that
day; and except they repent it shall
fall upon them, saith the Father,
yea, even upon all the nations of
the Gentiles.

21 And it shall come to pass that I
will establish my “people, O house
of Israel.

22 And behold, this “people will

448

I establish in this land, unto the
fulfilling of the "covenant which I
made with your father Jacob; and
it shall be a ‘New Jerusalem. And
the “powers of heaven shall be in
the midst of this people; yea, even
“I will be in the midst of you.

23 Behold, Iam he of whom Mo-
ses spake, saying: 7A prophet shall
the Lord your God raise up unto
you of your brethren, like unto
me; him shall ye hear in all things
whatsoever he shall say unto you.
And it shall come to pass that every
soul who will not hear that prophet
shall be cut off from among the
people.

24 Verily I say unto you, yea, and
“all the prophets from Samuel and
those that follow after, as many as
have spoken, have testified of me.

25 And behold, ye are the “children
of the prophets; and ye are of the
house of Israel; and ye are of the
’covenant which the Father made
with your fathers, saying unto Abra-
ham: And ‘in thy seed shall all the
kindreds of the earth be blessed.

26 The Father having raised me
up unto you first, and sent me to
“bless you in "turning away every
one of you from his iniquities; and
this because ye are the children of
the covenant—

27 And after that ye were blessed
then fulfilleth the Father the cov-
enant which he made with Abra-
ham, saying: “In thy seed shall all the
kindreds of the earth be blessed—

which *blessing upon the ‘Gentiles
shall make them mighty above all,
unto the ¢scattering of my people,

28 And they shall be a “scourge
unto the people of this land. Nev-

received the fulness of my gospel,
then if they shall harden their hearts
against me I will return their "iniqui-
ties upon their own heads, saith the

them that I would "gather them
together in mine own due time,
that I would give unto them again

God, and shall pray unto the Father
in my name.

32 Then shall their “watchmen lift
up their voice, and with the voice
together shall they sing; for they
shall see eye to eye.

33 Then will the Father gather
them together again, and give unto
them “Jerusalem for the "land of
their inheritance.

34 Then shall they break forth
into joy—*Sing together, ye waste

 

3 NEPHI 20:28-41

places of Jerusalem; for the Father
hath comforted his people, he hath
redeemed Jerusalem.

35 The Father hath made bare his
holy arm in the eyes of all the na-
tions; and all the ends of the earth
shall see the salvation of the Father;
and the Father and I are one.

36 And then shall be brought to
pass that which is written: “Awake,
awake again, and put on thy strength,
O Zion; put on thy beautiful gar-
ments, O Jerusalem, the holy city,
for henceforth there shall no more
come into thee the uncircumcised
and the unclean.

37 Shake thyself from the dust;
arise, sit down, O Jerusalem; loose
thyself from the bands of thy neck,
O captive daughter of Zion.

38 For thus saith the Lord: Ye
have sold yourselves for naught,
and ye shall be redeemed without
money.

39 Verily, verily, | say unto you,
that my people shall know my
name; yea, in that day they shall
know that Lam he that doth speak.

40 And then shall they say: “How
beautiful upon the mountains are
the feet of him that bringeth good
tidings unto them, that *publisheth
peace; that bringeth good tidings
unto them of good, that publisheth
salvation; that saith unto Zion: Thy
God reigneth!

41 And then shall a cry go forth:
*Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from
thence, touch not that which is ’un-
clean; go ye out of the midst of her;
be ye ‘clean that bear the vessels
of the Lord.

42 For ye shall “not go out with
bhaste nor go by flight; for the Lord
will go before you, and the God of
Israel shall be your rearward.

43 Behold, my servant shall deal
prudently; he shall be exalted and
extolled and be very high.

44 As many were astonished at
thee—his visage was so marred,
more than any man, and his form
more than the sons of men—

45 So shall he “sprinkle many
nations; the kings shall shut their
mouths at him, for that which had
not been told them shall they see;
and that which they had not heard
shall they °consider.

46 Verily, verily, lsay unto you, all
these things shall surely come, even
as the Father hath commanded me.
Then shall this covenant which the
Father hath covenanted with his
people be fulfilled; and then shall
“Jerusalem be inhabited again with
my people, and it shall be the land
of their inheritance.

CHAPTER 21

Israel will be gathered when the Book
of Mormon comes forth—The Gentiles
will be established as a free people in
America—They will be saved if they
believe and obey; otherwise, they will
be cut off and destroyed—tIsrael will
build the New Jerusalem, and the lost
tribes will return. About A.D. 34.

AND verily I say unto you, I give
unto you a “sign, that ye may know
the time when these things shall
be about to take place—that I shall
gather in, from their long disper-
sion, my people, O house of Israel,

 

450

and shall establish again among
them my Zion;

2 And behold, this is the thing
which I will give unto you for a
sign—for verily I say unto you that
“when these things which I de-
clare unto you, and which I shall
declare unto you hereafter of my-
self, and by the power of the Holy
Ghost which shall be given unto you
of the Father, shall be made known
unto the Gentiles that they may
know concerning this people who
are a remnant of the house of Jacob,
and concerning this my people who
shall be scattered by them;

3 Verily, verily, lsay unto you, when
these things shall be made “known
unto them of the Father, and shall
come forth of the Father, *from
them unto you;

4 For it is wisdom in the Father
that they should be established in
this land, and be set up as a “free
people by the power of the Father,
that these things might come forth
from them unto a remnant of your
seed, that the "covenant of the
Father may be fulfilled which he
hath covenanted with his people,
O house of Israel;

5 Therefore, when these works and
the works which shall be wrought
among you hereafter shall come
forth “from the Gentiles, unto your
’seed which shall dwindle in unbe-
lief because of iniquity;

6 For thus it behooveth the Father
that it should come forth from the
*Gentiles, that he may show forth
his power unto the Gentiles, for this
cause that the Gentiles, if they will
not harden their hearts, that they

may repent and come unto me and
be baptized in my name and know
of the true points of my doctrine,
that they may be "numbered among
my people, O house of Israel;

7 And when these things come
to pass that thy “seed shall begin to
know these things—it shall be a
sign unto them, that they may know
that the work of the Father hath al-
ready commenced unto the fulfill-
ing of the covenant which he hath
made unto the people who are of
the house of Israel.

8 And when that day shall come, it
shall come to pass that kings shall
shut their mouths; for that which
had not been told them shall they
see; and that which they had not
heard shall they “consider.

9 For in that day, for my sake shall
the Father ¢work a work, which
shall be a great and a ’marvelous
‘work among them; and there shall
be among them those who will not
believe it, although a man shall de-
clare it unto them.

10 But behold, the life of my ser-
vant shall be in my hand; therefore
they shall not hurt him, although he
shall be “marred because of them.
Yet I will heal him, for will show unto
them that ’my wisdom is greater
than the cunning of the devil.

11 Therefore it shall come to pass
that whosoever will not believe in
my words, who am Jesus Christ,
which the Father shall cause *him
to bring forth unto the °Gentiles,
and shall give unto him power that
he shall bring them forth unto the
Gentiles, (it shall be done even as

 

3 NEPHI 21:7-20

Moses said) they shall be ‘cut off
from among my people who are of
the covenant.

12 And my people who are a rem-
nant of Jacob shall be among the
Gentiles, yea, in the midst of them as
a “lion among the beasts of the for-
est, as a young lion among the flocks
of sheep, who, if he go through both
treadeth down and teareth in pieces,
and none can deliver.

13 Their hand shall be lifted up
upon their ¢adversaries, and all their
enemies shall be cut off.

14 Yea, wo be unto the Gentiles
except they “repent; for it shall
come to pass in that day, saith the
Father, that I will cut off thy horses
out of the midst of thee, and I will
destroy thy °chariots;

15 And I will cut off the cities of
thy land, and throw down all thy
*strongholds;

16 And I will cut off ¢witchcrafts
out of thy land, and thou shalt have
no more soothsayers;

17 Thy “graven images I will also
cut off, and thy standing images
out of the midst of thee, and thou
shalt no more worship the works
of thy hands;

18 And I will pluck up thy “groves
out of the midst of thee; so will I
destroy thy cities.

19 And it shall come to pass that
all “lyings, and deceivings, and en-
vyings, and strifes, and priestcrafts,
and whoredoms, shall be done away.

20 For it shall come to pass, saith
the Father, that at that ¢*day who-
soever will not repent and come

21 And I will execute “vengeance
and ’fury upon them, even as upon
the heathen, such as they have not
heard.

22 But if they will repent and heark-
en unto my words, and “harden not
their hearts, I will °establish my
church among them, and they shall
come in unto the covenant and be
‘numbered among this the remnant
of Jacob, unto whom I have given

23 And they shall assist my “peo-
ple, the remnant of Jacob, and also
as many of the house of Israel as
shall come, that they may build a
city, which shall be called the "New
Jerusalem.

24 And then shall “they assist my
people that they may be gathered
in, who are scattered upon all the
face of the land, in unto the New
Jerusalem.

25 And then shall the “power of
heaven come down among them;
and °I also will be in the midst.

26 And then shall the work of
the Father commence at that day,
even “when this gospel shall be
preached among the remnant of
’this people. Verily I say unto you,
at that day shall the work of the
Father commence among all the
dispersed of my people, yea, even the
tribes which have been ‘lost, which
the Father hath led away out of
Jerusalem.

27 Yea, the work shall commence
among all the “dispersed of my

 

452

people, with the Father to prepare
the way whereby they may come
unto me, that they may call on the
Father in my name.

28 Yea, and then shall the work
commence, with the Father among
all nations in preparing the way
whereby his people may be “gath-
ered home to the land of their in-
heritance.

29 And they shall go out from all
nations; and they shall “not go out
in *haste, nor go by flight, for I will
go before them, saith the Father,
and I will be their rearward.

CHAPTER 22

In the last days, Zion and her stakes
will be established, and Israel will be
gathered in mercy and tenderness—
They will triumph—Compare Isaiah

AND then shall that which is writ-
ten come to pass: Sing, O “barren,
thou that didst not bear; break forth
into "singing, and cry aloud, thou
that didst not travail with child;
for more are the children of the
‘desolate than the children of the
married wife, saith the Lord.

2 Enlarge the place of thy tent,
and let them stretch forth the cur-
tains of thy habitations; spare not,
lengthen thy cords and strengthen
thy “stakes;

3 For thou shalt break forth on
the right hand and on the left, and
thy seed shall “inherit the "Gentiles
and make the desolate cities to be
inhabited.

4 Fear not, for thou shalt not be
ashamed; neither be thou con-
founded, for thou shalt not be put to
“shame; for thou shalt forget the
’shame of thy youth, and shalt not re-
member the ‘reproach of thy youth,
and shalt not remember the re-
proach of thy widowhood any more.

5 For thy maker, thy “husband, the
Lord of Hosts is his name; and thy
Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel—
the God of the whole earth shall he
be called.

6 For the Lord hath called thee 4as
a woman forsaken and grieved in
spirit, and a wife of youth, when
thou wast refused, saith thy God.

7 For a small moment have I “for-
saken thee, but with great mercies
will I gather thee.

8 In a little wrath I hid my face
from thee for a moment, but with
everlasting “kindness will I have
b’mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy
Redeemer.

9 For “this, the "waters of Noah
unto me, for as I have sworn that
the waters of Noah should no more
go over the earth, so have I sworn
that I would not be wroth with thee.

10 For the “mountains shall depart
and the hills be removed, but my
’kindness shall not ‘depart from
thee, neither shall the covenant
of my peace be removed, saith the
Lord that hath mercy on thee.

11 O thou afflicted, tossed with
tempest, and not comforted! Behold,
I will lay thy “stones with fair col-
ors, and lay thy foundations with
sapphires.

12 And I will make thy windows
of agates, and thy gates of carbun-

 

3 NEPHI 22:4-23:2

cles, and all thy borders of pleasant
stones.

13 And “all thy children shall be
taught of the Lord; and great shall
be the ’peace of thy children.

14 In “righteousness shalt thou be
established; thou shalt be far from
oppression for thou shalt not fear,
and from terror for it shall not come
near thee.

15 Behold, they shall surely gather
together “against thee, not by me;
whosoever shall gather together
against thee shall fall for thy sake.

16 Behold, Ihave created the smith
that bloweth the coals in the fire,
and that bringeth forth an instru-
ment for his work; and I have created
the waster to destroy.

17 No weapon that is formed
against thee shall prosper; and every
tongue that shall revile against thee
in judgment thou shalt condemn.
This is the heritage of the “servants
of the Lord, and their righteousness
is of me, saith the Lord.

Jesus approves the words of Isaiah—
He commands the people to search the

that ye ought to “search these things.
Yea, a commandment I give unto
you that ye search these things dili-

“therefore it must needs be that he
must speak also to the Gentiles.

3 And all things that he spake have
been and “shall be, even according
to the words which he spake.

4 Therefore give heed to my words;
write the things which I have told
you; and according to the time and
the will of the Father “they shall go
forth unto the Gentiles.

5 And whosoever will hearken
unto my words and repenteth and
is baptized, the same shall be saved.
Search the “prophets, for many there
be that testify of these things.

6 And now it came to pass that
when Jesus had said these words he
said unto them again, after he had
expounded all the scriptures unto
them which they had received, he
said unto them: Behold, other scrip-
tures I would that ye should write,
that ye have not.

7 And it came to pass that he said
unto *Nephi: Bring forth the record
which ye have kept.

8 And when Nephi had brought
forth the records, and laid them
before him, he cast his eyes upon
them and said:

9 Verily I say unto you, I com-
manded my servant “Samuel, the
Lamanite, that he should testify
unto this people, that at the day
that the Father should glorify his
name in me that there were "many
‘saints who should “arise from the
dead, and should appear unto many,
and should minister unto them.
And he said unto them: Was it
not so?

10 And his disciples answered him
and said: Yea, Lord, Samuel did
prophesy according to thy words,
and they were all fulfilled.

11 And Jesus said unto them: How

 

454

be it that ye have not “written this
thing, that many ’saints did arise
and appear unto many and did
minister unto them?

12 And it came to pass that Nephi
remembered that this thing had not
been written.

13 And it came to pass that Jesus
commanded that it should be writ-
ten; therefore it was written accord-
ing as he commanded.

14 And now it came to pass that
when Jesus had “expounded all the
scriptures in one, which they had
written, he commanded them that
they should teach the things which
he had expounded unto them.

CHAPTER 24

The Lord’s messenger will prepare the
way for the Second Coming—Christ will
sit in judgment—Israel is commanded
to pay tithes and offerings—aA book of
remembrance is kept—Compare Mala-
chi 3. About A.D. 34.

AND it came to pass that he com-
manded them that they should
write the words which the Father
had given unto Malachi, which he
should tell unto them. And it came
to pass that after they were written
he expounded them. And these are
the words which he did tell unto
them, saying: Thus said the Father
unto Malachi—Behold, I will “send
my ’messenger, and he shall prepare
the way before me, and the Lord
whom ye seek shall suddenly ‘come
to his temple, even the ‘messenger
of the covenant, whom ye delight
in; behold, he shall come, saith the
Lord of Hosts.

his coming, and who shall stand
when he appeareth? For he is like

3 And he shall sit as a refiner and
purifier of silver; and he shall “pu-
rify the ’sons of Levi, and purge
them as gold and silver, that they
may ‘offer unto the Lord an offer-
ing in righteousness.

4 Then shall the offering of Judah
and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the
Lord, as in the days of old, and as
in former years.

5 And I will come “near to you
to judgment; and I will be a swift
witness against the "sorcerers, and
against the adulterers, and against
false “swearers, and against those
that “oppress the hireling in his
wages, the widow and the “father-
less, and that turn aside the ‘stranger,
and fear not me, saith the Lord
of Hosts.

6 For “lam the Lord, I change not;
therefore ye sons of Jacob are not

be room enough to receive it.

11 And I will rebuke the “devourer
for your sakes, and he shall not
destroy the fruits of your ground;
neither shall your vine cast her
fruit before the time in the fields,
saith the Lord of Hosts.

12 And all nations shall call you
blessed, for ye shall be a de-
lightsome land, saith the Lord of
Hosts.

13 Your words have been stout
against me, saith the Lord. Yet ye
say: What have we spoken against
thee?

14 Ye have “said: It is °vain to serve
God, and what doth it profit that
we have kept his ‘ordinances and
that we have walked mournfully
before the Lord of Hosts?

15 And now we call the proud
happy; yea, they that work wicked-
ness are set up; yea, they that tempt
God are even delivered.

16 Then they that feared the Lord
“spake often one to another, and
the Lord hearkened and heard;
and a book of *’remembrance was
written before him for them that
feared the Lord, and that thought
upon his name.

spare them as a man spareth his

18 Then shall ye return and dis-

wicked, between him that serveth
God and him that serveth him not.

CHAPTER 25

At the Second Coming, the proud and
wicked will be burned as stubble—Eli-
jah will return before that great and
dreadful day—Compare Malachi 4.
About A.D. 34.

"FoR behold, the day cometh that
shall "burn as an oven; and all the
‘proud, yea, and all that do wick-
edly, shall be stubble; and the day
that cometh shall burn them up,
saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall
leave them neither root nor branch.

2 But unto you that fear my name,
shall the “Son of Righteousness
arise with healing in his wings; and
ye shall go forth and ’grow up as
‘calves in the stall.

3 And ye shall “tread down the
wicked; for they shall be ashes un-
der the soles of your feet in the day
that I shall do this, saith the Lord
of Hosts.

4 Remember ye the law of Moses,
my servant, which I commanded
unto him in *Horeb for all Israel,
with the statutes and judgments.

5 Behold, I will send you “Elijah
the prophet before the coming
of the great and dreadful ’day of
the Lord;

 

456

6 And he shall “turn the heart of
the *fathers to the children, and
the heart of the children to their
fathers, lest I come and ‘smite the
earth with a curse.

CHAPTER 26

Jesus expounds all things from the be-
ginning to the end—Babes and children
utter marvelous things that cannot be
written—Those in the Church of Christ
have all things in common among them.
About A.D. 34.

AND now it came to pass that when
Jesus had told these things he ex-
pounded them unto the multitude;
and he did expound all things unto
them, both great and small.

2 And he saith: “These scriptures,
which ye had not with you, the
Father commanded that I should
give unto you; for it was wisdom
in him that they should be given
unto future generations.

3 And he did expound all things,
even from the beginning until the
“time that he should come in his
’slory—yea, even all things which
should come upon the face of the
earth, even until the ‘elements
should melt with fervent heat, and
the earth should be ‘wrapt together
as a scroll, and the heavens and the
earth should pass away;

4 And even unto the “great and last
day, when all people, and all kin-
dreds, and all nations and tongues
shall *stand before God, to be judged

of their works, whether they be good
or whether they be evil—

5 If they be good, to the “resur-
rection of everlasting life; and if
they be evil, to the resurrection of
damnation; being on a parallel, the
one on the one hand and the other
on the other hand, according to the
mercy, and the "justice, and the ho-
liness which is in Christ, who was
‘before the world began.

6 And now there cannot be writ-
ten in this book even a “hundredth
part of the things which Jesus did
truly teach unto the people;

7 But behold the “plates of Nephi
do contain the more part of the
things which he taught the people.

8 And these things have I writ-
ten, which are a “lesser part of the
things which he taught the people;
and I have written them to the in-
tent that they may be brought again
unto this people, "from the Gentiles,
according to the words which Jesus
hath spoken.

9 And when they shall have re-
ceived this, which is expedient that
they should have first, to try their
faith, and if it shall so be that they
shall believe these things then shall
the “greater things be made mani-
fest unto them.

10 And if it so be that they will not
believe these things, then shall the
“ereater things be ’withheld from
them, unto their condemnation.

11 Behold, I was about to write
them, all which were engraven
upon the plates of Nephi, but the
Lord “forbade it, saying: I will *try
the faith of my people.

 

3 NEPHI 26:5-16

12 Therefore I, *Mormon, do
write the things which have been
commanded me of the Lord. And
now I, "Mormon, make an end of
my sayings, and proceed to write
the things which have been com-
manded me.

13 Therefore, I would that ye
should behold that the Lord truly
did teach the people, for the space
of three days; and after that he did
“show himself unto them oft, and
did break "bread oft, and bless it,
and give it unto them.

14 And it came to pass that he did
teach and minister unto the ¢chil-
dren of the multitude of whom
hath been spoken, and he did "loose
their ‘tongues, and they did speak
unto their fathers great and mar-
velous things, even greater than he
had revealed unto the people; and
he loosed their tongues that they
could utter.

15 And it came to pass that after
he had ascended into heaven—the
second time that he showed him-
self unto them, and had gone unto
the Father, after having “healed
all their sick, and their lame, and
opened the eyes of their blind
and unstopped the ears of the deaf,
and even had done all manner of
cures among them, and raised a
man from the °dead, and had shown
forth his power unto them, and had
ascended unto the Father—

16 Behold, it came to pass on the
morrow that the multitude gathered
themselves together, and they both
saw and heard these children; yea,
even “babes did open their mouths

and utter marvelous things; and the
things which they did utter were
’forbidden that there should not
any man write them.

17 And it came to pass that the
“disciples whom Jesus had chosen
began *from that time forth to ‘bap-
tize and to teach as many as did
come unto them; and as many as
were baptized in the name of Jesus
were filled with the Holy Ghost.

18 And many of them saw and
heard unspeakable things, which
are “not lawful to be written.

19 And they taught, and did *min-
ister one to another; and they had
ball things “common among them,
every man dealing justly, one with
another.

20 And it came to pass that they
did do all things even as Jesus had
commanded them.

21 And they who were baptized
in the name of Jesus were called
the “church of Christ.

CHAPTER 27

Jesus commands them to call the Church
in His name—His mission and atoning
sacrifice constitute His gospel—Men are
commanded to repent and be baptized
that they may be sanctified by the Holy
Ghost—They are to be even as Jesus is.
About A.D. 34-35.

AND it came to pass that as the dis-
ciples of Jesus were journeying and
were preaching the things which
they had both heard and seen, and
were baptizing in the name of Jesus,
it came to pass that the disciples were
gathered together and were “united
in ’mighty prayer and ‘fasting.

2 And Jesus again “showed himself
unto them, for they were praying

 

458

unto the Father in his name; and
Jesus came and stood in the midst
of them, and said unto them: What
will ye that I shall give unto you?

3 And they said unto him: Lord,
we will that thou wouldst tell us the
“name whereby we shall call this
church; for there are disputations
among the people concerning this
matter.

4 And the Lord said unto them:
Verily, verily, | say unto you, why
is it that the people should murmur
and dispute because of this thing?

5 Have they not read the scriptures,
which say ye must take upon you
the “name of Christ, which is my
name? For by this name shall ye be
called at the last day;

6 And whoso taketh upon him my
name, and “endureth to the end, the
same shall be saved at the last day.

7 Therefore, whatsoever ye shall
do, ye shall do it in my name; there-
fore ye shall call the church in my
name; and ye shall call upon the
Father in my name that he will bless
the church for my sake.

8 And how be it “my ’church save
it be called in my name? For if a
church be called in Moses’ name then
it be Moses’ church; or if it be called
in the name of a man then it be the
church of a man; but if it be called
in my name then it is my church,
if it so be that they are built upon
my gospel.

9 Verily Isay unto you, that ye are
built upon my gospel; therefore ye
shall call whatsoever things ye do
call, in my name; therefore if ye call
upon the Father, for the church, if
it be in my name the Father will
hear you;

10 And if it so be that the church

is built upon my gospel then will
the Father show forth his own works
in it.

11 But if it be not built upon my
gospel, and is built upon the works
of men, or upon the works of the
devil, verily lsay unto you they have
joy in their works for a season,
and by and by the end cometh, and
they are “hewn down and cast into
the *fire, from whence there is no
return.

12 For their works do “follow them,
for it is because of their works that
they are hewn down; therefore re-
member the things that I have told
you.

13 Behold I have given unto you
my “gospel, and this is the gospel
which I have given unto you—that I
came into the world to do the will
of my Father, because my Father
sent me.

14 And my Father sent me that I
might be “lifted up upon the ’cross;
and after that I had been lifted up
upon the ‘cross, that I might ¢draw
all men unto me, that as I have been
lifted up by men even so should
men be lifted up by the Father, to
stand before me, to be ‘judged of
their works, whether they be good
or whether they be evil—

15 And for this cause have I been
“lifted up; therefore, according to
the power of the Father I will draw
all men unto me, that they may be
judged according to their works.

16 And it shall come to pass, that

 

3 NEPHI 27:11-21

whoso “repenteth and is baptized
in my "name shall be filled; and if
he ‘endureth to the end, behold,
him will I hold guiltless before
my Father at that day when I shall
stand to judge the world.

17 And he that endureth not unto
the end, the same is he that is also
hewn down and cast into the fire,
from whence they can no more
return, because of the “justice of
the Father.

18 And this is the word which he
hath given unto the children of men.
And for this cause he fulfilleth the
words which he hath given, and he
lieth not, but fulfilleth all his words.

19 And “no unclean thing can
enter into his kingdom; therefore
nothing entereth into his ’rest save
it be those who have ‘washed their
garments in my blood, because of
their faith, and the repentance of
all their sins, and their faithfulness
unto the end.

20 Now this is the commandment:
“Repent, all ye ends of the earth,
and come unto me and be ’baptized
in my name, that ye may be ‘sanc-
tified by the reception of the Holy
Ghost, that ye may stand “spotless
before me at the last day.

21 Verily, verily, | say unto you,
this is my “gospel; and ye know
the things that ye must °do in my
church; for the works which ye
have seen me do that shall ye also
do; for that which ye have seen me
do even that shall ye do;

blessed are ye, for ye shall be lifted
up at the last day.

23 “Write the things which ye have
seen and heard, save it be those
which are "forbidden.

24 Write the works of this people,

25 For behold, out of the books
which have been written, and which

be “judged, for by them shall their

26 And behold, all things are ¢writ-
ten by the Father; therefore out of

shall the world be judged.

27 And know ye that “ye shall be

to the judgment which I shall give
unto you, which shall be just. There-
fore, what “manner of men ought ye
to be? Verily I say unto you, even

28 And now I “go unto the Father.
And verily I say unto you, whatso-
ever things ye shall ask the Father
in my name shall be given unto you.

29 Therefore, “ask, and ye shall re-
ceive; knock, and it shall be opened
unto you; for he that asketh, receiv-
eth; and unto him that knocketh,
it shall be opened.

30 And now, behold, my joy is
great, even unto fulness, because of
you, and also this generation; yea,
and even the Father rejoiceth, and
also all the holy angels, because of
you and this generation; for “none
of them are lost.

31 Behold, I would that ye should

understand; for 1 mean them who
are “now alive of 'this generation;
and none of them are lost; and in
them I have fulness of “joy.

32 But behold, it *sorroweth me
because of the ’fourth generation
from this generation, for they are
led away captive by him even as
was the ‘son of perdition; for they
will sell me for silver and for gold,
and for that which ¢moth doth cor-
rupt and which thieves can break
through and steal. And in that day
will I visit them, even in turning
their works upon their own heads.

33 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had ended these sayings he
said unto his disciples: Enter ye in at
the “strait gate; for strait is the gate,
and narrow is the way that leads
to life, and few there be that find
it; but wide is the gate, and broad
the way which leads to death, and
many there be that travel therein,
until the night cometh, wherein no
man can work.

CHAPTER 28

Nine of the twelve disciples desire and
are promised an inheritance in Christ’s
kingdom when they die—The Three
Nephites desire and are given power over

they are now ministering among men.

2 And they all spake, save it were
three, saying: We desire that after
we have lived unto the age of man,
that our ministry, wherein thou
hast called us, may have an end,
that we may speedily come unto
thee in thy kingdom.

3 And he said unto them: Blessed
are ye because ye desired this thing
of me; therefore, after that ye are
4seventy and two years old ye shall
come unto me in my ’kingdom; and
with me ye shall find ‘rest.

4 And when he had spoken unto
them, he turned himself unto the
three, and said unto them: What
will ye that I should do unto you,
when I am gone unto the Father?

5 And they sorrowed in their
hearts, for they durst not speak unto
him the thing which they desired.

6 And he said unto them: Behold,
1¢know your thoughts, and ye have
desired the thing which "John, my
beloved, who was with me in my
ministry, before that I was lifted up
by the Jews, desired of me.

7 Therefore, more blessed are ye,
for ye shall “never taste of "death;
but ye shall live to behold all the do-
ings of the Father unto the children
of men, even until all things shall
be fulfilled according to the will of
the Father, when I shall come in my
glory with the ‘powers of heaven.

while ye shall dwell in the flesh,
neither sorrow save it be for the

I do because of the thing which ye
have desired of me, for ye have de-
sired that ye might bring the souls
of men unto me, while the world
shall stand.

10 And for this cause ye shall have
“fulness of joy; and ye shall sit down
in the kingdom of my Father; yea,
your joy shall be full, even as the
Father hath given me fulness of
joy; and ye shall be even as I am,
and I am even as the Father; and
the Father and I are °one;

11 And the “Holy Ghost beareth
record of the Father and me; and
the Father giveth the Holy Ghost
unto the children of men, because
of me.

12 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had spoken these words, he
touched every one of them with his
finger save it were the “three who
were to tarry, and then he departed.

13 And behold, the heavens were
opened, and they were “caught up
into heaven, and saw and heard
unspeakable things.

14 And it was “forbidden them
that they should utter; neither was
it given unto them "power that they
could utter the things which they
saw and heard;

15 And whether they were in the
body or out of the body, they could
not tell; for it did seem unto them
like a “transfiguration of them, that

they were changed from this body
of flesh into an immortal state,
that they could behold the things
of God.

16 But it came to pass that they
did again minister upon the face
of the earth; nevertheless they did
not minister of the things which
they had heard and seen, because
of the commandment which was
given them in heaven.

17 And now, whether they were
mortal or immortal, from the day
of their transfiguration, I know not;

18 But this much I know, accord-
ing to the record which hath been
given—they did go forth upon the
face of the land, and did minister
unto all the people, uniting as many
to the church as would believe in
their preaching; baptizing them,
and as many as were baptized did
receive the Holy Ghost.

19 And they were cast into prison
by them who did not belong to the
church. And the “prisons could not
hold them, for they were rent in
twain.

20 And they were cast down into
the earth; but they did smite the
earth with the word of God, inso-
much that by his “power they were
delivered out of the depths of the
earth; and therefore they could not
dig pits sufficient to hold them.

21 And thrice they were cast into
a “furnace and received no harm.

22 And twice were they cast into
a “den of wild beasts; and behold
they did play with the beasts asa
child with a suckling lamb, and re-
ceived no harm.

23 And it came to pass that thus
they did go forth among all the
people of Nephi, and did preach
the “gospel of Christ unto all peo-
ple upon the face of the land; and

 

462

they were converted unto the Lord,
and were united unto the church of
Christ, and thus the people of ’that
generation were blessed, according
to the word of Jesus.

24 And now I, 7Mormon, make an
end of speaking concerning these
things for a time.

25 Behold, I was about to write the
“names of those who were never to
taste of death, but the Lord forbade;
therefore I write them not, for they
are hid from the world.

26 But behold, “I have seen them,
and they have ministered unto me.

27 And behold they will be “among
the Gentiles, and the Gentiles shall
know them not.

28 They will also be among the
Jews, and the Jews shall know
them not.

29 And it shall come to pass, when
the Lord seeth fit in his wisdom
that they shall minister unto all the
“scattered tribes of Israel, and unto
all nations, kindreds, tongues and
people, and shall bring out of them
unto Jesus many souls, that their
desire may be fulfilled, and also
because of the convincing power
of God which is in them.

30 And they are as the “angels of
God, and if they shall pray unto the
Father in the name of Jesus they can
show themselves unto whatsoever
man it seemeth them good.

31 Therefore, great and marvelous
works shall be wrought by them,
before the “great and coming day
when all people must surely stand
before the judgment-seat of Christ;

32 Yea even among the Gentiles
shall there be a “great and marvel-
ous work wrought by them, before
that judgment day.

marvelous works of Christ, ye
would, according to the words of
Christ, know that these things must
surely come.

34 And wo be unto him that will
‘not hearken unto the words of Jesus,
and also to them whom he hath
chosen and ’sent among them; for
whoso ‘receiveth not the words of
Jesus and the words of those whom
he hath sent receiveth not him; and
therefore he will not receive them
at the last day;

35 And it would be better for them
if they had not been born. For do ye
suppose that ye can get rid of the
justice of an “offended God, who hath
been "trampled under feet of men,
that thereby salvation might come?

36 And now behold, as I spake
concerning those whom the Lord
hath chosen, yea, even three who
were caught up into the heavens,
that I knew not whether they were
“cleansed from 'mortality to im-
mortality—

37 But behold, since I wrote, I have
inquired of the Lord, and he hath
made it manifest unto me that there
must needs be a change wrought
upon their bodies, or else it needs
be that they must taste of death;

38 Therefore, that they might not
taste of death there was a “change
wrought upon their bodies, that
they might not ’suffer pain nor
sorrow save it were for the sins of
the world.

39 Now this change was not equal
to that which shall take place at the
last day; but there was a change
wrought upon them, insomuch
that Satan could have no power
over them, that he could not “tempt
them; and they were "sanctified in
the flesh, that they were “holy, and

 

3 NEPHI 28:34-29:4

that the powers of the earth could
not hold them.

40 And in this state they were to
remain until the judgment day of
Christ; and at that day they were
to receive a greater change, and to
be received into the kingdom of
the Father to go no more out, but
to dwell with God eternally in the
heavens.

CHAPTER 29

The coming forth of the Book of Mor-
mon is a sign that the Lord has com-
menced to gather Israel and fulfill
His covenants—Those who reject His
latter-day revelations and gifts will be
cursed. About A.D. 34-35.

AND now behold, I say unto you
that when the Lord shall see fit, in
his wisdom, that these sayings shall
“come unto the Gentiles according
to his word, then ye may know that
the 'covenant which the Father
hath made with the children of Is-
rael, concerning their restoration
to the ‘lands of their inheritance,
is already beginning to be fulfilled.

2 And ye may know that the words
of the Lord, which have been spo-
ken by the holy prophets, shall all
be fulfilled; and ye need not say
that the Lord “delays his coming
unto the children of Israel.

3 And ye need not imagine in
your hearts that the words which
have been spoken are vain, for be-
hold, the Lord will remember his
covenant which he hath made unto
his people of the house of Israel.

4 And when ye shall see these say-
ings coming forth among you, then
ye need not any longer spurn at the
doings of the Lord, for the “sword
of his *justice is in his right hand;

and behold, at that day, if ye shall
spurn at his doings he will cause
that it shall soon overtake you.

5 *Wo unto him that ’spurneth at
the doings of the Lord; yea, wo unto
him that shall ‘deny the Christ and
his works!

6 Yea, “wo unto him that shall deny
the revelations of the Lord, and that
shall say the Lord no longer worketh
by revelation, or by prophecy, or by
’sifts, or by tongues, or by healings,
or by the power of the Holy Ghost!

7 Yea, and wo unto him that shall
say at that day, to get “gain, that there
can be ’no miracle wrought by Jesus
Christ; for he that doeth this shall
become ‘like unto the son of perdi-
tion, for whom there was no mercy,
according to the word of Christ!

8 Yea, and ye need not any longer
“hiss, nor ’spurn, nor make game of
the ‘Jews, nor any of the remnant
of the house of Israel; for behold,
the Lord remembereth his covenant
unto them, and he will do unto
them according to that which he
hath sworn.

9 Therefore ye need not suppose
that ye can turn the right hand of
the Lord unto the left, that he may
not execute judgment unto the ful-

filling of the covenant which he
hath made unto the house of Israel.

The latter-day Gentiles are commanded
to repent, come unto Christ, and be num-
bered with the house of Israel. About

HEARKEN, O ye Gentiles, and hear
the words of Jesus Christ, the Son
of the living God, which he hath
“commanded me that I should speak
concerning you, for, behold he com-
mandeth me that I should write,
saying:

2 Turn, all ye “Gentiles, from your
wicked ways; and "repent of your
evil doings, of your “lyings and de-
ceivings, and of your whoredoms,
and of your secret abominations,
and your idolatries, and of your
4murders, and your ‘priestcrafts,
and your ‘envyings, and your strifes,
and from all your wickedness and
abominations, and come unto me,
and be baptized in my name, that ye
may receive a remission of your sins,
and be filled with the Holy Ghost,
that ye may be ‘numbered with
my people who are of the house of
Israel.

FOURTH NEPHI
THE BOOK OF NEPHI

WHO IS THE SON OF NEPHI—ONE OF THE
DISCIPLES OF JESUS CHRIST

An account of the people of Nephi, according to his record.

The Nephites and the Lamanites are
all converted unto the Lord—They have
all things in common, work miracles,
and prosper in the land—After two cen-
turies, divisions, evils, false churches,
and persecutions arise—After three
hundred years, both the Nephites and
the Lamanites are wicked—Amma-
ron hides up the sacred records. About
A.D. 35-321.

ND it came to pass that the
thirty and fourth year passed
away, and also the thirty and
fifth, and behold the disciples of
Jesus had formed a church of Christ
in all the lands round about. And as
many as did come unto them, and
did truly repent of their sins, were
*baptized in the name of Jesus; and
they did also receive the Holy Ghost.
2 And it came to pass in the thirty
and sixth year, the people were all
converted unto the Lord, upon all
the face of the land, both Nephites
and Lamanites, and there were no
contentions and disputations among
them, and every man did deal justly
one with another.

3 And they had all things com-
mon among them; therefore there
were not rich and poor, bond and
free, but they were all made free,
and partakers of the heavenly °gift.

4 And it came to pass that the
thirty and seventh year passed away
also, and there still continued to be
“peace in the land.

 

5 And there were great and mar-
velous works wrought by the dis-
ciples of Jesus, insomuch that
they did “heal the sick, and raise
the dead, and cause the lame to
walk, and the blind to receive
their sight, and the deaf to hear;
and all manner of ‘miracles did
they work among the children of
men; and in nothing did they work
miracles save it were in the name
of Jesus.

6 And thus did the thirty and
eighth year pass away, and also the
thirty and ninth, and forty and first,
and the forty and second, yea, even
until forty and nine years had passed
away, and also the fifty and first,
and the fifty and second; yea, and
even until fifty and nine years had
passed away.

7 And the Lord did prosper them
exceedingly in the land; yea, in-
somuch that they did build cities
again where there had been cities
burned.

8 Yea, even that great ¢city Zara-
hemla did they cause to be built
again.

9 But there were many cities which
had been “sunk, and waters came
up in the stead thereof; therefore
these cities could not be renewed.

10 And now, behold, it came to pass
that the people of Nephi did wax
strong, and did multiply exceedingly
fast, and became an exceedingly “fair
and delightsome people.

11 And they were married, and
given in marriage, and were blessed
according to the multitude of the
“promises which the Lord had made
unto them.

12 And they did not walk any more
after the “performances and °ordi-
nances of the ‘law of Moses; but they
did walk after the commandments
which they had received from their
Lord and their God, continuing in
“fasting and prayer, and in meet-
ing together oft both to pray and
to hear the word of the Lord.

13 And it came to pass that there
was no contention among all the
people, in all the land; but there
were mighty miracles wrought
among the disciples of Jesus.

14 And it came to pass that the sev-
enty and first year passed away, and
also the seventy and second year,
yea, and in fine, till the seventy and
ninth year had passed away; yea,
even an hundred years had passed
away, and the “disciples of Jesus,
whom he had chosen, had all gone to
the "paradise of God, save it were the
‘three who should tarry; and there
were other “disciples ‘ordained in
their stead; and also many of that
fgeneration had passed away.

15 And it came to pass that there
was no “contention in the land, be-
cause of the "love of God which did
dwell in the hearts of the people.

16 And there were no “envyings,
nor ’strifes, nor ‘tumults, nor whore-
doms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor
any mannet of “lasciviousness; and
surely there could not be a ‘hap-
pier people among all the people
who had been created by the hand
of God.

 

466

17 There were no robbers, nor
murderers, neither were there La-
manites, nor any manner of -ites;
but they were in “one, the children
of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom
of God.

18 And how blessed were they! For
the Lord did bless them in all their
doings; yea, even they were blessed
and prospered until an hundred
and ten years had passed away; and
the first generation from Christ
had passed away, and there was no
contention in all the land.

19 And it came to pass that “Nephi,
he that kept this last record, (and he
kept it upon the "plates of Nephi)
died, and his son Amos kept it in
his stead; and he kept it upon the
plates of Nephi also.

20 And he kept it eighty and four
years, and there was still peace in
the land, save it were a small part
of the people who had revolted from
the church and taken upon them
the name of Lamanites; therefore
there began to be “Lamanites again
in the land.

21 And it came to pass that “Amos
died also, (and it was an hundred
and ninety and four years from the
coming of Christ) and his son Amos
kept the record in his stead; and
he also kept it upon the plates of
Nephi; and it was also written in the
book of Nephi, which is this book.

22 And it came to pass that two
hundred years had passed away;
and the second generation had all
passed away save it were a few.

23 And now I, Mormon, would that
ye should know that the people had
multiplied, insomuch that they were
spread upon all the face of the land,

and that they had become exceed-
ingly “rich, because of their pros-
perity in Christ.

24 And now, in this two hundred
and first year there began to be
among them those who were lifted
up in “pride, such as the wearing of
costly apparel, and all manner of
fine pearls, and of the fine things
of the world.

25 And from that time forth they
did have their goods and their sub-
stance no more “common among
them.

26 And they began to be divided
into classes; and they began to build
up “churches unto themselves to get
bsain, and began to deny the true
church of Christ.

27 And it came to pass that when
two hundred and ten years had
passed away there were many
churches in the land; yea, there were
many churches which professed to
know the Christ, and yet they did
“deny the more parts of his gospel,
insomuch that they did receive all
manner of wickedness, and did ad-
minister that which was sacred unto
him to whom it had been "forbidden
because of unworthiness.

28 And this church did multiply
exceedingly because of iniquity,
and because of the power of “Satan
who did get hold upon their "hearts.

29 And again, there was another
church which denied the Christ;
and they did “persecute the true
’church of Christ, because of their
humility and their belief in Christ;
and they did despise them because
of the many miracles which were
wrought among them.

30 Therefore they did exercise
power and authority over the dis-
ciples of Jesus who did tarry with

 

4 NEPHI 1:24-37

them, and they did cast them into
“prison; but by the power of the
word of God, which was in them,
the prisons were rent in twain, and
they went forth doing mighty mir-
acles among them.

31 Nevertheless, and notwithstand-
ing all these miracles, the people
did harden their hearts, and did
seek to kill them, even as the Jews
at Jerusalem sought to kill Jesus,
according to his word.

32 And they did cast them into
“furnaces of *fire, and they came
forth receiving no harm.

33 And they also cast them into
“dens of wild beasts, and they did
play with the wild beasts even asa
child with a lamb; and they did come
forth from among them, receiving
no harm.

34 Nevertheless, the people did
harden their hearts, for they were
led by many priests and “false
prophets to build up many churches,
and to do all manner of iniquity.
And they did "smite upon the peo-
ple of Jesus; but the people of Jesus
did not smite again. And thus they
did dwindle in unbelief and wick-
edness, from year to year, even until
two hundred and thirty years had
passed away.

35 And now it came to pass in this
year, yea, in the two hundred and
thirty and first year, there was a
great division among the people.

36 And it came to pass that in this
year there arose a people who were
called the “Nephites, and they were
true believers in Christ; and among
them there were those who were
called by the Lamanites—Jacobites,
and Josephites, and °Zoramites;

37 Therefore the true believers in
Christ, and the true worshipers of

Christ, (among whom were the “three
disciples of Jesus who should tarry)
were called Nephites, and Jacobites,
and Josephites, and Zoramites.

38 And it came to pass that they
who rejected the gospel were called
Lamanites, and Lemuelites, and Ish-
maelites; and they did not dwindle
in “unbelief, but they did ’wilfully
rebel against the gospel of Christ;
and they did teach their children
that they should not believe, even
as their fathers, from the beginning,
did dwindle.

39 And it was because of the
wickedness and abomination of
their fathers, even as it was in the
beginning. And they were “taught
to hate the children of God, even
as the Lamanites were taught to
*hate the children of Nephi from
the beginning.

40 And it came to pass that two
hundred and forty and four years
had passed away, and thus were the
affairs of the people. And the “more
wicked part of the people did wax
strong, and became exceedingly
more numerous than were the peo-
ple of God.

41 And they did still continue to
build up churches unto themselves,
and adorn them with all manner
of precious things. And thus did
two hundred and fifty years pass
away, and also two hundred and
sixty years.

42 And it came to pass that the
wicked part of the people began
again to build up the secret oaths
and “combinations of Gadianton.

43 And also the people who were
called the people of Nephi began to
be proud in their hearts, because of

 

468

their exceeding riches, and become
*vain like unto their brethren, the
Lamanites.

44 And from this time the disci-
ples began to sorrow for the “sins
of the world.

45 And it came to pass that when
three hundred years had passed
away, both the people of Nephi
and the Lamanites had become
exceedingly wicked one like unto
another.

46 And it came to pass that the rob-
bers of “Gadianton did spread over
all the face of the land; and there
were none that were righteous save
it were the disciples of Jesus. And
gold and silver did they lay up in
store in abundance, and did "traffic
in all manner of traffic.

47 And it came to pass that after
three hundred and five years had
passed away, (and the people did
still remain in wickedness) “Amos
died; and his brother, Ammaron,
did keep the record in his stead.

48 And it came to pass that when
three hundred and twenty years
had passed away, “Ammaron, being
constrained by the Holy Ghost, did
bhide up the ‘records which were
4sacred—yea, even all the sacred
records which had been handed
down from generation to generation,
which were sacred—even until the
three hundred and twentieth year
from the coming of Christ.

49 And he did hide them up unto
the Lord, that they might “come
again unto the remnant of the house
of Jacob, according to the prophe-
cies and the promises of the Lord.
And thus is the end of the record
of Ammaron.

THE BOOK OF MORMON

CHAPTER 1

Ammaron instructs Mormon concerning
the sacred records—War commences be-
tween the Nephites and the Lamanites—
The Three Nephites are taken away—
Wickedness, unbelief, sorceries, and
witchcraft prevail. About A.D. 321-26.

ND now I, Mormon, make a
“record of the things which I
have both seen and heard, and

call it the "Book of Mormon.

2 And about the time that “Am-
maron hid up the records unto the
Lord, he came unto me, (I being
about ten years of age, and I began
to be "learned somewhat after the
manner of the learning of my peo-
ple) and Ammaron said unto me: I
perceive that thou art a ‘sober child,
and art quick to observe;

3 Therefore, when ye are about
twenty and four years old I would
that ye should remember the things
that ye have observed concerning
this people; and when ye are of that
age go to the “land Antum, unto a
hill which shall be called °Shim;
and there have I deposited unto
the Lord all the sacred engravings
concerning this people.

4 And behold, ye shall take the
“plates of Nephi unto yourself, and
the remainder shall ye leave in the
place where they are; and ye shall
engrave on the plates of Nephi all
the things that ye have observed
concerning this people.

5 And I, Mormon, being a descen-
dant of “Nephi, (and my father’s
name was Mormon) I remembered
the things which Ammaron com-
manded me.

6 And it came to pass that I, being
eleven years old, was carried by my

 

father into the land southward, even
to the land of Zarahemla.

7 The whole face of the land had
become covered with buildings, and
the people were as numerous almost,
as it were the sand of the sea.

8 And it came to pass in this year
there began to be a war between
the “Nephites, who consisted of the
Nephites and the Jacobites and the
Josephites and the Zoramites; and
this war was between the Nephites,
and the Lamanites and the Lemuel-
ites and the Ishmaelites.

9 Now the “Lamanites and the
Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites were
called Lamanites, and the two par-
ties were Nephites and Lamanites.

10 And it came to pass that the
war began to be among them in
the borders of Zarahemla, by the
waters of Sidon.

11 And it came to pass that the
Nephites had gathered together a
great number of men, even to ex-
ceed the number of thirty thousand.
And it came to pass that they did
have in this same year a number
of “battles, in which the Nephites
did beat the Lamanites and did slay
many of them.

12 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites withdrew their design,
and there was peace settled in the
land; and peace did remain for the
space of about four years, that there
was no bloodshed.

13 But wickedness did prevail
upon the face of the whole land,
insomuch that the Lord did take
away his “beloved disciples, and
the work of miracles and of healing
did cease because of the iniquity of
the people.

14 And there were no “gifts from

the Lord, and the "Holy Ghost did
not come upon any, because of their
wickedness and ‘unbelief.

15 And I, being “fifteen years of
age and being somewhat of a ’so-
ber mind, therefore I was ‘visited
of the Lord, and “tasted and knew
of the goodness of Jesus.

16 And I did endeavor to preach
unto this people, but my mouth
was shut, and I was forbidden that
I should preach unto them; for be-
hold they had ‘wilfully rebelled
against their God; and the beloved
disciples were "taken away out of
the land, because of their iniquity.

17 But I did remain among them,
but I was forbidden to “preach unto
them, because of the hardness of
their hearts; and because of the
hardness of their hearts the land
was ’cursed for their sake.

18 And these Gadianton robbers,
who were among the Lamanites, did
infest the land, insomuch that the
inhabitants thereof began to “hide
up their "treasures in the earth; and
they became slippery, because the
Lord had cursed the land, that they
could not hold them, nor retain
them again.

19 And it came to pass that there
were ‘sorceries, and witchcrafts,
and magics; and the power of the
evil one was wrought upon all the
face of the land, even unto the ful-
filling of all the words of Abinadi,
and also "Samuel the Lamanite.

CHAPTER 2

Mormon leads the Nephite armies—
Blood and carnage sweep the land—The
Nephites lament and mourn with the
sorrowing of the damned—Their day

 

470

of grace is passed—Mormon obtains
the plates of Nephi—Wars continue.
About A.D. 327-50.

AND it came to pass in that same
year there began to be a war again
between the Nephites and the La-
manites. And notwithstanding I
being “young, was large in stat-
ure; therefore the people of Nephi
appointed me that I should be
their leader, or the leader of their
armies.

2 Therefore it came to pass that in
my sixteenth year I did go forth at
the head of an army of the Neph-
ites, against the Lamanites; there-
fore three hundred and twenty and
six years had passed away.

3 And it came to pass that in the
three hundred and twenty and
seventh year the Lamanites did
come upon us with “exceedingly
great power, insomuch that they
did frighten my armies; therefore
they would not fight, and they be-
gan to retreat towards the ’north
countries.

4 And it came to pass that we did
come to the city of Angola, and we
did take possession of the city, and
make preparations to defend our-
selves against the Lamanites. And it
came to pass that we did “fortify the
city with our might; but notwith-
standing all our fortifications the
Lamanites did come upon us and
did drive us out of the city.

5 And they did also drive us forth
out of the land of David.

6 And we marched forth and came
to the land of Joshua, which was in
the borders west by the seashore.

7 And it came to pass that we did
gather in our people as fast as it were

possible, that we might get them
together in “one body.

8 But behold, the land was “filled
with "robbers and with Lamanites;
and notwithstanding the great de-
struction which hung over my peo-
ple, they did not repent of their evil
doings; therefore there was blood
and carnage spread throughout all
the face of the land, both on the
part of the Nephites and also on
the part of the Lamanites; and it was
one complete revolution through-
out all the face of the land.

9 And now, the Lamanites had a
king, and his name was “Aaron; and
he came against us with an army of
forty and four thousand. And be-
hold, I withstood him with forty and
two thousand. And it came to pass
that I beat him with my army that
he fled before me. And behold, all
this was done, and three hundred
and thirty years had passed away.

10 And it came to pass that the
Nephites began to repent of their
iniquity, and began to cry even as
had been prophesied by Samuel the
prophet; for behold no man could
*keep that which was his own, for
the thieves, and the robbers, and
the murderers, and the magic art,
and the witchcraft which was in
the land.

11 Thus there began to be a *mourn-
ing and a lamentation in all the
land because of these things, and
more especially among the people
of Nephi.

12 And it came to pass that when I,
Mormon, saw their lamentation and
their ¢mourning and their sorrow
before the Lord, my heart did begin
to rejoice within me, Knowing the
mercies and the long-suffering of

 

MORMON 2:8-18

the Lord, therefore supposing that
he would be merciful unto them
that they would "again become a
righteous people.

13 But behold this my joy was vain,
for their “sorrowing was not unto
repentance, because of the goodness
of God; but it was rather the °sor-
rowing of the ‘damned, because the
Lord would not always suffer them
to take “happiness in sin.

14 And they did not come unto
Jesus with broken “hearts and con-
trite spirits, but they did ’curse God,
and wish to die. Nevertheless they
would struggle with the sword for
their lives.

15 And it came to pass that my
sorrow did return unto me again,
and I saw that the “day of ’grace
‘was passed with them, both tem-
porally and spiritually; for 1 saw
thousands of them hewn down in
open “rebellion against their God,
and heaped up as ‘dung upon the
face of the land. And thus three
hundred and forty and four years
had passed away.

16 And it came to pass that in the
three hundred and forty and fifth
year the Nephites did begin to flee
before the Lamanites; and they were
pursued until they came even to the
land of Jashon, before it was pos-
sible to stop them in their retreat.

17 And now, the city of Jashon
was near the “land where Amma-
ron had ’deposited the records unto
the Lord, that they might not be
destroyed. And behold I had gone
according to the word of Ammaron,
and taken the ‘plates of Nephi, and
did make a record according to the
words of Ammaron.

18 And upon the plates of Nephi I

did make a full account of all the
wickedness and abominations; but
upon “these plates I did forbear to
make a full account of their wicked-
ness and abominations, for behold,
a continual scene of wickedness and
abominations has been before mine
eyes ever since I have been suffi-
cient to behold the ways of man.

19 And wo is me because of their
wickedness; for my heart has been
filled with sorrow because of their
wickedness, all my days; neverthe-
less, I Know that I shall be “lifted
up at the last day.

20 And it came to pass that in this
year the people of Nephi again were
hunted and driven. And it came to
pass that we were driven forth un-
til we had come northward to the
land which was called Shem.

21 And it came to pass that we did
“fortify the city of Shem, and we
did gather in our people as much
as it were possible, that perhaps we
might save them from destruction.

22 And it came to pass in the three
hundred and forty and sixth year
they began to come upon us again.

23 And it came to pass that I did
speak unto my people, and did urge
them with great energy, that they
would stand boldly before the La-
manites and “fight for their ’wives,
and their children, and their houses,
and their homes.

24 And my words did arouse them
somewhat to vigor, insomuch that
they did not flee from before the
Lamanites, but did stand with bold-
ness against them.

25 And it came to pass that we
did contend with an army of thirty
thousand against an army of fifty
thousand. And it came to pass that
we did stand before them with such
firmness that they did flee from
before us.

26 And it came to pass that when
they had fled we did pursue them

 

472

with our armies, and did meet them
again, and did “beat them; never-
theless the ’strength of the Lord
was not with us; yea, we were left
to ourselves, that the Spirit of the
Lord did not abide in us; therefore
we had become weak like unto our
brethren.

27 And my heart did sorrow be-
cause of this the great calamity of
my people, because of their wick-
edness and their abominations, But
behold, we did go forth against the
Lamanites and the robbers of Gadi-
anton, until we had again taken
possession of the lands of our in-
heritance.

28 And the three hundred and
forty and ninth year had passed
away. And in the three hundred and
fiftieth year we made atreaty with
the Lamanites and the robbers of
Gadianton, in which we did get the
lands of our inheritance divided.

29 And the Lamanites did give
unto us the land “northward, yea,
even to the "narrow passage which
led into the land southward. And
we did give unto the Lamanites all
the land southward.

CHAPTER 3

Mormon cries repentance unto the
Nephites—They gain a great victory and
glory in their own strength—Mormon
refuses to lead them, and his prayers
for them are without faith—The Book
of Mormon invites the twelve tribes
of Israel to believe the gospel. About
A.D. 360-62.

AND it came to pass that the Laman-
ites did not come to battle again un-
tilten years more had passed away.
And behold, I had employed my
people, the Nephites, in preparing
their lands and their arms against
the time of battle.

2 And it came to pass that the
Lord did say unto me: Cry unto

this people—Repent ye, and come
unto me, and be ye baptized, and
build up again my church, and ye
shall be “spared.

3 And I did cry unto this people,
but it was “in vain; and they did
’not realize that it was the Lord
that had spared them, and granted
unto them a chance for repentance.
And behold they did harden their
hearts against the Lord their God.

4 And it came to pass that after
this tenth year had passed away,
making, in the whole, three hundred
and sixty years from the coming of
Christ, the king of the Lamanites
sent an epistle unto me, which gave
unto me to know that they were
preparing to come again to battle
against us.

5 And it came to pass that I did
cause my people that they should
gather themselves together at the
land “Desolation, to a city which was
in the borders, by the narrow pass
which led into the land "southward.

6 And there we did place our
armies, that we might stop the
armies of the Lamanites, that they
might not get possession of any of
our lands; therefore we did fortify
against them with all our force.

7 And it came to pass that in the
three hundred and sixty and first
year the Lamanites did come down
to the “city of Desolation to battle
against us; and it came to pass that
in that year we did beat them, inso-
much that they did return to their
own lands again.

8 And in the three hundred and
sixty and second year they did
come down “again to battle. And
we did beat them again, and did

 

MORMON 3:3-15

slay a great number of them, and
their dead were cast into the sea.

9 And now, because of this great
thing which my people, the Neph-
ites, had done, they began to “boast
in their own strength, and began
to swear before the heavens that
they would avenge themselves of
the blood of their brethren who
had been slain by their enemies.

10 And they did “swear by the
heavens, and also by the throne
of God, that they "would go up to
battle against their enemies, and
would cut them off from the face of
the land.

11 And it came to pass that I, Mor-
mon, did utterly “refuse from this
time forth to be a commander and
a leader of this people, because of
their wickedness and abomination.

12 Behold, I had led them, notwith-
standing their wickedness I had led
them many times to battle, and had
loved them, according to the “love of
God which was in me, with all my
heart; and my soul had been poured
out in prayer unto my God all the
day long for them; nevertheless, it
was >without faith, because of the
‘hardness of their hearts.

13 And “thrice have I delivered
them out of the hands of their en-
emies, and they have repented not
of their sins.

14 And when they had sworn by
all that had been “forbidden them
by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
that they would go up unto their
enemies to battle, and avenge them-
selves of the blood of their breth-
ren, behold the voice of the Lord
came unto me, saying:

15 “Vengeance is mine, and I will

’repay; and because this people
repented not after I had delivered
them, behold, they shall be cut off
from the face of the earth.

16 And it came to pass that I ut-
terly refused to go up against mine
enemies; and I did even as the Lord
had commanded me; and I did stand
as an idle witness to manifest unto
the world the things which I saw
and heard, according to the mani-
festations of the Spirit which had
testified of things to come.

17 Therefore I write “unto you,
Gentiles, and also unto you, house
of Israel, when the work shall com-
mence, that ye shall be about to pre-
pare to return to the land of your
inheritance;

18 Yea, behold, I write unto all the
ends of the earth; yea, unto you,
twelve tribes of Israel, who shall be
*judged according to your works by
the twelve whom Jesus chose to be
his disciples in the land of Jerusalem.

19 And I write also unto the rem-
nant of this people, who shall also
be judged by the “twelve whom
Jesus chose in this land; and they
shall be judged by the other twelve
whom Jesus chose in the land of
Jerusalem.

20 And these things doth the Spirit
manifest unto me; therefore I write
unto you all. And for this cause I
write unto you, that ye may know
that ye must all stand before the
¢judgment-seat of Christ, yea, every
soul who belongs to the whole hu-
man *family of Adam; and ye must
stand to be judged of your works,
whether they be good or evil;

21 And also that ye may “believe
the gospel of Jesus Christ, which
ye shall "have among you; and also

 

474

that the ‘Jews, the covenant people
of the Lord, shall have other ¢wit-
ness besides him whom they saw
and heard, that Jesus, whom they
slew, was the ‘very Christ and the
very God.

22 And I would that I could per-
suade “all ye ends of the earth to
repent and prepare to stand before
the judgment-seat of Christ.

CHAPTER 4

War and carnage continue—The wicked
punish the wicked—Greater wicked-
ness prevails than ever before in all
Israel—Women and children are sacri-
ficed to idols—The Lamanites begin to
sweep the Nephites before them. About
A.D. 363-75.

AND now it came to pass that in the
three hundred and sixty and third
year the Nephites did go up with their
armies to “battle against the La-
manites, out of the land Desolation.

2 And it came to pass that the
armies of the Nephites were driven
back again to the land of Desolation.
And while they were yet weary, a
fresh army of the Lamanites did
come upon them; and they had a
sore battle, insomuch that the La-
manites did take possession of the
“city Desolation, and did slay many
of the Nephites, and did take many
prisoners.

3 And the remainder did flee and
join the inhabitants of the city Te-
ancum. Now the city Teancum lay
in the borders by the seashore; and
it was also near the city “Desolation.

4 And it was “because the armies
of the Nephites went up unto the
Lamanites that they began to be
smitten; for were it not for that, the

over them.

5 But, behold, the judgments of
God will overtake the “wicked; and
it is by the wicked that the wicked
are "punished; for it is the wicked
that stir up the hearts of the chil-
dren of men unto bloodshed.

6 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites did make preparations
to come against the city Teancum.

7 And it came to pass in the
three hundred and sixty and fourth
year the Lamanites did come
against the city Teancum, that they
might take possession of the city
Teancum also.

8 And it came to pass that they
were repulsed and driven back by
the Nephites. And when the Neph-
ites saw that they had driven the
Lamanites they did again “boast
of their own strength; and they
went forth in their own might, and
took possession again of the city
Desolation.

9 And now all these things had
been done, and there had been
thousands slain on both sides, both
the Nephites and the Lamanites.

10 And it came to pass that the
three hundred and sixty and sixth
year had passed away, and the La-
manites came again upon the Neph-
ites to battle; and yet the Nephites
repented not of the evil they had
done, but persisted in their wick-
edness continually.

11 And it is impossible for the
tongue to describe, or for man to
write a perfect description of the
horrible scene of the blood and
carnage which was among the
people, both of the Nephites and
of the Lamanites; and every heart
was hardened, so that they “de-
lighted in the shedding of blood
continually.

 

MORMON 4:5-19

12 And there never had been so
great “wickedness among all the
children of Lehi, nor even among
all the house of Israel, according
to the words of the Lord, as was
among this people.

13 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites did take possession of
the city Desolation, and this be-
cause their “number did exceed the
number of the Nephites.

14 And they did also march for-
ward against the city Teancum, and
did drive the inhabitants forth out
of her, and did take many prisoners
both women and children, and did
offer them up as “sacrifices unto
their idol gods.

15 And it came to pass that in
the three hundred and sixty and
seventh year, the Nephites being
angry because the Lamanites had
sacrificed their women and their
children, that they did go against
the Lamanites with exceedingly
great anger, insomuch that they
did beat again the Lamanites, and
drive them out of their lands.

16 And the Lamanites did not
come again against the Nephites
until the three hundred and sev-
enty and fifth year.

17 And in this year they did come
down against the Nephites with all
their powers; and they were not
numbered because of the greatness
of their number.

18 And “from this time forth did
the Nephites gain no power over the
Lamanites, but began to be swept
off by them even as a dew before
the sun.

19 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites did come down against
the *city Desolation; and there was
an exceedingly sore battle fought in
the land Desolation, in the which
they did beat the Nephites.

20 And they fled again from be-
fore them, and they came to the
city Boaz; and there they did stand
against the Lamanites with exceed-
ing boldness, insomuch that the La-
manites did not beat them until they
had come again the second time.

21 And when they had come the
second time, the Nephites were
driven and slaughtered with an
exceedingly great slaughter; their
women and their “children were
again sacrificed unto idols.

22 And it came to pass that the
Nephites did again flee from before
them, taking all the inhabitants with
them, both in towns and villages.

23 And now I, Mormon, seeing that
the Lamanites were about to over-
throw the land, therefore I did go
to the hill “Shim, and did take up
all the records which Ammaron
had hid up unto the Lord.

CHAPTER 5

Mormon again leads the Nephite armies
in battles of blood and carnage—The
Book of Mormon will come forth to con-
vince all Israel that Jesus is the Christ
—Because of their unbelief, the Laman-
ites will be scattered, and the Spirit will
cease to strive with them—They will re-
ceive the gospel from the Gentiles in the
latter days. About A.D. 375-84.

AND it came to pass that I did go
forth among the Nephites, and did
repent of the *oath which I had
made that I would no more assist
them; and they gave me command
again of their armies, for they
looked upon me as though I could
deliver them from their afflictions.

2 But behold, I was ¢without hope,
for I knew the judgments of the Lord
which should come upon them; for
they repented not of their iniqui-
ties, but did struggle for their lives
without calling upon that Being
who created them.

 

476

3 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites did come against us as
we had fled to the city of Jordan;
but behold, they were driven back
that they did not take the city at
that time.

4 And it came to pass that they
came against us again, and we
did maintain the city. And there
were also other cities which were
maintained by the Nephites, which
strongholds did cut them off that
they could not get into the country
which lay before us, to destroy the
inhabitants of our land.

5 But it came to pass that whatso-
ever lands we had passed by, and
the inhabitants thereof were not
gathered in, were destroyed by the
Lamanites, and their towns, and vil-
lages, and cities were burned with
fire; and thus three hundred and
seventy and nine years passed away.

6 And it came to pass that in the
three hundred and eightieth year
the Lamanites did come again
against us to battle, and we did stand
against them boldly; but it was all in
vain, for so “great were their num-
bers that they did tread the people
of the Nephites under their feet.

7 And it came to pass that we did
again take to flight, and those whose
flight was swifter than the Laman-
ites’ did escape, and those whose
flight did not exceed the Lamanites’
were swept down and destroyed.

8 And now behold, I, Mormon, do
not desire to harrow up the souls of
men in casting before them such an
awful scene of blood and carnage
as was laid before mine eyes; but
I, knowing that these things must
surely be made known, and that
all things which are hid must be
“revealed upon the house-tops—

9 And also that a knowledge of
these things must “come unto the
remnant of these people, and also
unto the Gentiles, who the Lord

hath said should ’scatter this people,
and this people should be counted
as naught among them—therefore
‘I write a ‘small abridgment, dar-
ing not to give a full account of the
things which I have seen, because
of the commandment which I have
received, and also that ye might
not have too great sorrow because
of the wickedness of this people.

10 And now behold, this I speak
unto their seed, and also to the Gen-
tiles who have care for the house of
Israel, that realize and know from
whence their blessings come.

11 For I know that such will sor-
row for the calamity of the house
of Israel; yea, they will sorrow for
the destruction of this people; they
will sorrow that this people had
not repented that they might have
been clasped in the arms of Jesus.

12 Now “these things are written
unto the ‘remnant of the house of
Jacob; and they are written after this
manner, because it is known of God
that wickedness will not bring them
forth unto them; and they are to be
“hid up unto the Lord that they may
come forth in his own due time.

13 And this is the commandment
which I have received; and behold,
they “shall come forth accord-
ing to the commandment of the
Lord, when he shall see fit, in his
wisdom.

14 And behold, they shall go unto
the “unbelieving of the "Jews; and
for this intent shall they go—that
they may be ‘persuaded that Jesus

MORMON 5:10-19

is the Christ, the Son of the living
God; that the Father may bring
about, through his most Beloved,
his great and eternal purpose, in
restoring the Jews, or all the house
of Israel, to the “land of their inheri-
tance, which the Lord their God
hath given them, unto the fulfilling
of his “covenant;

15 And also that the seed of “this
people may more fully believe his
gospel, which shall go forth unto
them from the Gentiles; for this
people shall be ‘scattered, and shall
“become a dark, a filthy, and a loath-
some people, beyond the descrip-
tion of that which ever hath been
amongst us, yea, even that which
hath been among the Lamanites, and
this because of their unbelief and
idolatry.

16 For behold, the Spirit of the
Lord hath already ceased to “strive
with their fathers; and they are
without Christ and God in the world;
and they are driven about as "chaff
before the wind.

17 They were once a delightsome
people, and they had Christ for their
“shepherd; yea, they were led even
by God the Father.

18 But now, behold, they are “led
about by Satan, even as chaff is
driven before the wind, or as a ves-
sel is tossed about upon the waves,
without sail or anchor, or without
anything wherewith to steer her;
and even as she is, so are they.

served their blessings, which they

for the “Gentiles who shall possess
the land.

20 But behold, it shall come to
pass that they shall be driven and
scattered by the Gentiles; and after
they have been driven and scattered
by the Gentiles, behold, then will
the Lord “remember the ’covenant

unto all the house of Israel.

ber the “prayers of the righteous,
which have been put up unto him
for them.

can ye stand before the power of
God, except ye shall repent and
turn from your evil ways?

23 Know ye not that ye are in the
*hands of God? Know ye not that
he hath all power, and at his great
command the "earth shall be ‘rolled
together as a scroll?

24 Therefore, repent ye, and hum-
ble yourselves before him, lest he
shall come out in justice against
you—lest a “remnant of the seed of
Jacob shall go forth among you as
a *lion, and tear you in pieces, and
there is none to deliver.

CHAPTER 6

The Nephites gather to the land of Cu-
morah for the final battles—Mormon
hides the sacred records in the hill Cu-
morah—The Lamanites are victorious,
and the Nephite nation is destroyed—
Hundreds of thousands are slain with
the sword. About A.D. 385.

AND now I finish my record concern-
ing the “destruction of my people,
the Nephites. And it came to pass

 

478

that we did march forth before the
Lamanites.

2 And I, Mormon, wrote an epis-
tle unto the king of the Lamanites,
and desired of him that he would
grant unto us that we might gather
together our people unto the “land
of °Cumorah, by a hill which was
called Cumorah, and there we could
give them battle.

3 And it came to pass that the king
of the Lamanites did grant unto me
the thing which I desired.

4 And it came to pass that we did
march forth to the land of Cumorah,
and we did pitch our tents around
about the hill Cumorah; and it was in
a land of ‘many waters, rivers, and
fountains; and here we had hope to
gain advantage over the Lamanites.

5 And when “three hundred and
eighty and four years had passed
away, we had gathered in all the
remainder of our people unto the
land of Cumorah.

6 And it came to pass that when
we had gathered in all our people
in one to the land of Cumorah, be-
hold I, Mormon, began to be old; and
knowing it to be the last struggle of
my people, and having been com-
manded of the Lord that I should
not suffer the records which had
been handed down by our fathers,
which were “sacred, to fall into the
hands of the Lamanites, (for the
Lamanites would ’destroy them)
therefore 1 made ‘this record out
of the plates of Nephi, and “hid up
in the hill Cumorah all the records
which had been entrusted to me by
the hand of the Lord, save it were
‘these few plates which I gave unto
my son ‘Moroni.

7 And it came to pass that my peo-
ple, with their wives and their chil-
dren, did now behold the “armies
of the Lamanites marching towards
them; and with that awful *fear of
death which fills the breasts of all
the wicked, did they await to re-
ceive them.

8 And it came to pass that they
came to battle against us, and every
soul was filled with terror because
of the greatness of their numbers.

9 And it came to pass that they
did fall upon my people with the
sword, and with the bow, and with
the arrow, and with the ax, and with
all manner of weapons of war.

10 And it came to pass that my men
were hewn down, yea, even my “ten
thousand who were with me, and I
fell wounded in the midst; and they
passed by me that they did not put
an end to my life.

11 And when they had gone through
and hewn down “all my people save
it were twenty and four of us, (among
whom was my son Moroni) and
we having survived the dead of our
people, did behold on the morrow,
when the Lamanites had returned
unto their camps, from the top of
the hill Cumorah, the ten thousand
of my people who were hewn down,
being led in the front by me.

12 And we also beheld the ten
thousand of my people who were
led by my son Moroni.

13 And behold, the ten thousand
of Gidgiddonah had fallen, and he
also in the midst.

14 And Lamah had fallen with his
ten thousand; and Gilgal had fallen
with his ten thousand; and Lim-
hah had fallen with his ten thou-
sand; and Jeneum had fallen with
his ten thousand; and Cumenihah,
and Moronihah, and Antionum,
and Shiblom, and Shem, and Josh,

 

MORMON 6:7-22

had fallen with their ten thousand
each.

15 And it came to pass that there
were ten more who did fall by the
sword, with their ten thousand each;
yea, even “all my people, save it were
those twenty and four who were
with me, and also a ’few who had
escaped into the south countries,
and a few who had deserted over
unto the Lamanites, had fallen; and
their flesh, and bones, and blood
lay upon the face of the earth, being
left by the hands of those who slew
them to molder upon the land, and
to crumble and to return to their
mother earth.

16 And my soul was rent with “an-
guish, because of the slain of my
people, and I cried:

17 70 ye fair ones, how could ye
have departed from the ways of the
Lord! O ye fair ones, how could ye
have rejected that Jesus, who stood
with open arms to receive you!

18 Behold, if ye had not done this,
ye would not have fallen. But behold,
ye are fallen, and I*mourn your loss.

19 O ye “fair sons and daughters,
ye fathers and mothers, ye husbands
and wives, ye fair ones, how is it
that ye could have "fallen!

20 But behold, ye are gone, and my
sorrows cannot bring your return.

21 And the day soon cometh that
your mortal must put on immor-
tality, and these bodies which are
now moldering in corruption must
soon become “incorruptible bodies;
and then ye must stand before
the judgment-seat of Christ, to be
judged according to your works;
and if it so be that ye are righteous,
then are ye blessed with your fathers
who have gone before you.

22 O that ye had repented before
this great “destruction had come
upon you. But behold, ye are gone,

CHAPTER 7

Mormon invites the Lamanites of the
latter days to believe in Christ, accept
His gospel, and be saved—All who be-
lieve the Bible will also believe the Book
of Mormon. About A.D. 385.

AND now, behold, I would speak
somewhat unto the “remnant of this
people who are spared, if it so be
that God may give unto them my
words, that they may know of the
things of their fathers; yea, I speak
unto you, ye remnant of the house
of Israel; and these are the words
which I speak:

2 Know ye that ye are of the “house
of Israel.

3 Know ye that ye must come unto
repentance, or ye cannot be saved.

4 Know ye that ye must lay down
your weapons of war, and delight no
more in the shedding of blood, and
take them not again, save it be that
God shall ¢command you.

5 Know ye that ye must come to
the “knowledge of your fathers, and
repent of all your sins and iniquities,
and *believe in Jesus Christ, that he
is the Son of God, and that he was
slain by the Jews, and by the power
of the Father he hath risen again,
whereby he hath gained the ‘vic-
tory over the grave; and also in him
is the sting of death swallowed up.

 

480

6 And he bringeth to pass the res-
urrection of the dead, whereby man
must be raised to stand before his
>judgment-seat.

7 And he hath brought to pass the
“redemption of the "world, whereby
he that is found ‘guiltless before him
at the judgment day hath it given
unto him to “dwell in the presence
of God in his kingdom, to sing cease-
less praises with the ‘choirs above,
unto the Father, and unto the Son,
and unto the Holy Ghost, which are
fone God, in a state of ‘happiness
which hath no end.

8 Therefore repent, and be baptized
in the name of Jesus, and lay hold
upon the “gospel of Christ, which
shall be set before you, not only in
this record but also in the record
which shall come unto the Gentiles
’from the Jews, which record shall
come from the Gentiles “unto you.

9 For behold, “this is "written for
the intent that ye may ‘believe
that; and if “ye believe that ye will
believe this also; and if ye believe
this ye will know concerning your
fathers, and also the marvelous
works which were wrought by the
power of God among them.

10 And ye will also know that ye
are a“remnant of the seed of Jacob;
therefore ye are numbered among
the people of the first covenant; and
if it so be that ye believe in Christ,
and are baptized, first with water,
then with fire and with the Holy
Ghost, following the ‘example of
our Savior, according to that which

CHAPTER 8

The Lamanites seek out and destroy
the Nephites—The Book of Mormon
will come forth by the power of God—
Woes pronounced upon those who
breathe out wrath and strife against the
work of the Lord—The Nephite record
will come forth in a day of wicked-
ness, degeneracy, and apostasy. About
A.D. 400-421.

BEHOLD I, *Moroni, do finish the
’record of my father, Mormon, Be-
hold, I have but few things to write,
which things I have been com-
manded by my father.

2 And now it came to pass that
after the *great and tremendous
battle at Cumorah, behold, the
Nephites who had escaped into the
country southward were hunted by
the "Lamanites, until they were all
destroyed.

3 And my father also was killed by
them, and I even “remain "alone to
write the sad tale of the destruction
of my people. But behold, they are
gone, and I fulfil the commandment
of my father. And whether they will
slay me, I know not.

4 Therefore I will write and “hide
up the records in the earth; and
whither I go it mattereth not.

5 Behold, my father hath made
*this record, and he hath written
the intent thereof. And behold, I
would write it also if I had room
upon the "plates, but I have not;
and ore I have none, for 1am alone.
My father hath been slain in battle,
and all my kinsfolk, and I have not

 

MORMON 8:1-12

friends nor whither to go; and ‘how
long the Lord will suffer that I may

6 Behold, “four hundred years have
passed away since the coming of
our Lord and Savior.

7 And behold, the Lamanites have
hunted my people, the Nephites,
down from city to city and from
place to place, even until they are
no more; and great has been their
“fall; yea, great and marvelous is
the destruction of my people, the
Nephites.

8 And behold, it is the hand of the
Lord which hath done it. And behold
also, the Lamanites are at *war one
with another; and the whole face of
this land is one continual round of
murder and bloodshed; and no one
knoweth the end of the war.

9 And now, behold, I say no more
concerning them, for there are none
save it be the Lamanites and “rob-
bers that do exist upon the face of
the land.

10 And there are none that do
know the true God save it be the
“disciples of Jesus, who did tarry in
the land until the wickedness of the
people was so great that the Lord
would not suffer them to °remain
with the people; and whether they
be upon the face of the land no man
knoweth.

11 But behold, my “father and I
have seen ’them, and they have
ministered unto us,

12 And whoso receiveth “this record,
and shall not condemn it because of
the imperfections which are in it, the
same shall know of greater things
than these, Behold, I am Moroni;
and were it possible, I would make
all things known unto you.

13 Behold, I make an end of speak-
ing concerning this people. lam the
son of Mormon, and my father was
a *descendant of Nephi.

14 And I am the same who “hid-
eth up this record unto the Lord;
the plates thereof are of no worth,
because of the commandment of
the Lord. For he truly saith that no
one shall have them "to get gain;
but the record thereof is of ‘great
worth; and whoso shall bring it to
light, him will the Lord bless.

15 For none can have power to
bring it to light save it be given him
of God; for God wills that it shall
be done with an “eye single to his
glory, or the welfare of the ancient
and long dispersed covenant people
of the Lord.

16 And blessed be “he that shall
bring this thing to light; for it shall
be "brought out of darkness unto
light, according to the word of God;
yea, it shall be brought out of the
earth, and it shall shine forth out of
darkness, and come unto the knowl-
edge of the people; and it shall be
done by the power of God.

17 And if there be “faults they
be the faults of a man. But behold,
we know no fault; nevertheless
God knoweth all things; therefore,
he that °condemneth, let him be
aware lest he shall be in danger of
hell fire.

18 And he that saith: Show unto
me, or ye shall be “smitten—let him
beware lest he commandeth that
which is forbidden of the Lord.

19 For behold, the same that “judg-
eth rashly shall be judged rashly

 

482

again; for according to his works
shall his wages be; therefore, he
that smiteth shall be smitten again,
of the Lord.

20 Behold what the scripture
says—man shall not “smite, neither
shall he °judge; for judgment is
mine, saith the Lord, and vengeance
is mine also, and I will repay.

21 And he that shall breathe out
«wrath and ’strifes against the work
of the Lord, and against the ‘cov-
enant people of the Lord who are
the house of Israel, and shall say: We
will destroy the work of the Lord,
and the Lord will not remember
his covenant which he hath made
unto the house of Israel—the same
is in danger to be hewn down and
cast into the fire;

22 For the eternal “purposes of
the Lord shall roll on, until all his
promises shall be fulfilled.

23 Search the prophecies of “Isaiah.
Behold, I cannot write them. Yea, be-
hold I say unto you, that those saints
who have gone before me, who have
possessed this land, shall cry, yea,
even from the dust will they cry unto
the Lord; and as the Lord liveth he
will remember the covenant which
he hath made with them.

24 And he knoweth their “prayers,
that they were in behalf of their
brethren. And he knoweth their
faith, for in his name could they re-
move ’mountains; and in his name
could they cause the earth to shake;
and by the power of his word did
they cause “prisons to tumble to the
earth; yea, even the fiery furnace
could not harm them, neither wild

25 And behold, their “prayers
were also in behalf of him that the
Lord should suffer to bring these
things forth.

26 And no one need say they shall
not come, for they surely shall, for
the Lord hath spoken it; for “out of
the earth shall they come, by the
hand of the Lord, and none can stay
it; and it shall come in a day when it
shall be said that "miracles are done
away; and it shall come even as if
one should speak ‘from the dead.

27 And it shall come in a day when
the “blood of saints shall cry unto
the Lord, because of secret "combi-
nations and the works of darkness,

28 Yea, it shall come ina day when
the power of God shall be “denied,
and ’churches become defiled and
be ‘lifted up in the pride of their
hearts; yea, even in a day when lead-
ers of churches and teachers shall
rise in the pride of their hearts,
even to the envying of them who
belong to their churches.

29 Yea, it shall come ina day when
*there shall be heard of fires, and
tempests, and ’vapors of smoke in
foreign lands;

30 And there shall also be heard
of “wars, rumors of wars, and earth-
quakes in divers places.

31 Yea, it shall come ina day when
there shall be great ¢pollutions upon
the face of the earth; there shall be
’murders, and robbing, and lying,

and deceivings, and whoredoms, and
all manner of abominations; when
there shall be many who will say,
Do this, or do that, and it ‘mattereth
not, for the Lord will “uphold such
at the last day. But wo unto such,
for they are in the ‘gall of bitter-
ness and in the ‘bonds of iniquity.

32 Yea, it shall come in a day when
there shall be ¢churches built up
that shall say: Come unto me, and
for your money you shall be for-
given of your sins.

33 O ye wicked and perverse and
*stiffnecked people, why have ye
built up churches unto yourselves
to get "gain? Why have ye ‘trans-
figured the holy word of God, that
ye might bring “damnation upon
your souls? Behold, look ye unto
the ‘revelations of God; for behold,
the time cometh at that day when
all these things must be fulfilled.

34 Behold, the Lord hath shown
unto me great and marvelous things
concerning that which must shortly
come, at that day when these things
shall come forth among you.

35 Behold, I speak unto you as if
ye were present, and yet ye are not.
But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown
you unto me, and I know your
doing.

36 And I know that ye do 4¢walk in
the pride of your hearts; and there
are none save a few only who do
not °lift themselves up in the pride
of their hearts, unto the wearing of

and strifes, and malice, and persecu-
tions, and all manner of iniquities;
and your churches, yea, even every
one, have become polluted because
of the pride of your hearts.

37 For behold, ye do love “money,
and your substance, and your fine
apparel, and the adorning of your
churches, more than ye love the
poor and the needy, the sick and
the afflicted.

38 O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites,
ye teachers, who sell yourselves for
that which will canker, why have
ye polluted the holy church of God?
Why are ye “ashamed to take upon
you the name of Christ? Why do ye
not think that greater is the value
of an endless happiness than that
b’misery which never dies—because
of the ‘praise of the world?

39 Why do ye adorn yourselves
with that which hath no life, and
yet suffer the hungry, and the needy,
and the naked, and the sick and the
afflicted to pass by you, and notice
them not?

40 Yea, why do ye build up your
4secret abominations to get gain, and
cause that widows should mourn
before the Lord, and also orphans
to mourn before the Lord, and also
the blood of their fathers and their
husbands to cry unto the Lord from
the ground, for vengeance upon
your heads?

41 Behold, the sword of vengeance
hangeth over you; and the time soon
cometh that he avengeth the “blood
of the saints upon you, for he will
not suffer their cries any longer.

CHAPTER 9

Moroni calls upon those who do not be-
lieve in Christ to repent—He proclaims

 

484

a God of miracles, who gives revelations
and pours out gifts and signs upon
the faithful—Méiracles cease because
of unbelief—Signs follow those who
believe—Men are exhorted to be wise
and keep the commandments. About
A.D. 401-21.

AND now, I speak also concerning
those who do not believe in Christ.

2 Behold, will ye believe in the day
of your visitation—behold, when
the Lord shall come, yea, even that
“great day when the "earth shall be
rolled together as a scroll, and the
elements shall ‘melt with fervent
heat, yea, in that great day when
ye shall be brought to stand before
the Lamb of God—then will ye say
that there is no God?

3 Then will ye longer deny the
Christ, or can ye behold the Lamb
of God? Do ye suppose that ye shall
dwell with him under a “conscious-
ness of your guilt? Do ye suppose
that ye could be happy to dwell with
that holy Being, when your souls
are racked with a consciousness
of guilt that ye have ever abused
his laws?

4 Behold, I say unto you that ye
would be more miserable to dwell
with a holy and just God, under a
consciousness of your “filthiness
before him, than ye would to dwell
with the "damned souls in ‘hell.

5 For behold, when ye shall be
brought to see your “nakedness be-
fore God, and also the glory of God,
and the ’holiness of Jesus Christ, it
will kindle a flame of unquench-
able fire upon you.

6 O then ye “unbelieving, "turn ye
unto the Lord; cry mightily unto the
Father in the name of Jesus, that
perhaps ye may be found spotless,

‘pure, fair, and white, having been
cleansed by the blood of the “Lamb,
at that great and last day.

7 And again I speak unto you who
“deny the revelations of God, and say
that they are done away, that there
are no revelations, nor prophecies,
nor gifts, nor healing, nor speaking
with tongues, and the "interpreta-
tion of tongues;

8 Behold I say unto you, he that
denieth these things knoweth not
the “gospel of Christ; yea, he has not
read the scriptures; if so, he does
not "understand them.

9 For do we not read that God is the
“same *yesterday, today, and forever,
and in him there is no ‘variableness
neither shadow of changing?

10 And now, if ye have imagined
up unto yourselves a god who doth
vary, and in whom there is shadow
of changing, then have ye imagined
up unto yourselves a god who is not
a God of miracles,

11 But behold, I will show unto you
a God of “miracles, even the God
of Abraham, and the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob; and it is that
same °God who created the heavens
and the earth, and all things that
in them are.

12 Behold, he created Adam, and
by “Adam came the °fall of man.
And because of the fall of man came
Jesus Christ, even the Father and
the Son; and because of Jesus Christ
came the ‘redemption of man.

13 And because of the redemp-
tion of man, which came by Jesus
Christ, they are brought back into

 

MORMON 9:7-17

the “presence of the Lord; yea, this
is wherein all men are redeemed,
because the death of Christ bringeth
to pass the "resurrection, which
bringeth to pass a redemption from
an endless ‘sleep, from which sleep
all men shall be awakened by the
power of God when the trump shall
sound; and they shall come forth,
both small and great, and all shall
stand before his bar, being re-
deemed and loosed from this eter-
nal ¢band of death, which death isa
temporal death.

14 And then cometh the “judgment
of the Holy One upon them; and
then cometh the time that he that
is *filthy shall be filthy still; and
he that is righteous shall be righ-
teous still; he that is happy shall be
happy still; and he that is unhappy
shall be unhappy still.

15 And now, O all ye that have
imagined up unto yourselves a god
who can do “no miracles, I would
ask of you, have all these things
passed, of which I have spoken? Has
the end come yet? Behold I say unto
you, Nay; and God has not ceased
to be a God of miracles.

16 Behold, are not the things that
God hath wrought marvelous in our
eyes? Yea, and who can comprehend
the marvelous “works of God?

17 Who shall say that it was not
a miracle that by his ¢word the
heaven and the earth should be; and
by the power of his word man was
’created of the ‘dust of the earth;
and by the power of his word have
miracles been wrought?

18 And who shall say that Jesus
Christ did not do many mighty
“miracles? And there were many
’mighty miracles wrought by the
hands of the apostles.

19 And if there were “miracles
wrought then, why has God ceased
to be a God of miracles and yet be
an unchangeable Being? And be-
hold, I say unto you he "’changeth
not; if so he would cease to be God;
and he ceaseth not to be God, and
is a God of miracles.

20 And the reason why he ceaseth
to do “miracles among the children
of men is because that they dwindle
in unbelief, and depart from the
right way, and know not the God
in whom they should "trust.

21 Behold, I say unto you that
whoso believeth in Christ, doubting
nothing, ‘whatsoever he shall ask
the Father in the name of Christ
it shall be granted him; and this
’promise is unto all, even unto the
ends of the earth.

22 For behold, thus said Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, unto his
disciples who should tarry, yea,
and also to 4all his disciples, in the
hearing of the multitude: Go ye
into all the world, and preach the
gospel to every creature;

23 And he that “believeth and is
baptized shall be saved, but he that
believeth not shall be "damned;

24 And “these signs shall follow
them that believe—in my name
shall they cast out *devils; they shall
speak with new tongues; they shall

 

486

take up serpents; and if they drink
any deadly thing it shall not hurt
them; they shall lay “hands on the
sick and they shall recover;

25 And whosoever shall believe in
my name, doubting nothing, unto
him will I *confirm all my words,
even unto the ends of the earth.

26 And now, behold, who can stand
“against the works of the Lord?
’Who can deny his sayings? Who
will rise up against the almighty
power of the Lord? Who will de-
spise the works of the Lord? Who
will despise the children of Christ?
Behold, all ye who are ‘despisers of
the works of the Lord, for ye shall
wonder and perish.

27 O then despise not, and wonder
not, but hearken unto the words of
the Lord, and ask the Father in the
name of Jesus for what things so-
ever ye shall stand in need. “Doubt
not, but be believing, and begin as
in times of old, and come unto the
Lord with all your ‘heart, and «work
out your own salvation with fear
and trembling before him.

28 Be “wise in the days of your
’probation; strip yourselves of all
uncleanness; ask not, that ye may
consume it on your ‘lusts, but ask
with a firmness unshaken, that ye
will yield to no temptation, but
that ye will serve the true and
4living God.

not of the sacrament of Christ

things in ‘worthiness, and do it in
the name of Jesus Christ, the Son
of the living God; and if ye do this,
and endure to the end, ye will in
nowise be cast out.

30 Behold, I speak unto you as
though I ¢spake from the dead; for
I know that ye shall have my words.

31 Condemn me not because of
mine “imperfection, neither my
father, because of his imperfection,
neither them who have written be-
fore him; but rather give thanks
unto God that he hath made mani-
fest unto you our imperfections,
that ye may learn to be more wise
than we have been.

32 And now, behold, we have writ-
ten this record according to our
knowledge, in the characters which
are called among us the “reformed
Egyptian, being handed down and
altered by us, according to our man-
ner of speech.

33 And if our plates had been
‘sufficiently large we should have
written in Hebrew; but the Hebrew
hath been altered by us also; and if

 

THE BOOK

we could have written in Hebrew,
behold, ye would have had no °im-
perfection in our record.

34 But the Lord knoweth the things
which we have written, and also
that none other people knoweth our
language; and because that none
other people knoweth our language,
therefore he hath prepared “means
for the interpretation thereof.

35 And these things are written
that we may rid our garments of
the blood of our “brethren, who
have dwindled in unbelief.

36 And behold, these things which
we have “desired concerning our
brethren, yea, even their restora-
tion to the knowledge of Christ, are
according to the prayers of all the
saints who have dwelt in the land.

37 And may the Lord Jesus Christ
grant that their prayers may be
answered according to their faith;
and may God the Father remember
the covenant which he hath made
with the house of Israel; and may
he bless them forever, through faith
on the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

OF ETHER

The record of the Jaredites, taken from the twenty-four plates found by the
people of Limhi in the days of King Mosiah.

CHAPTER 1

Moroni abridges the writings of Ether—
Ether’s genealogy is set forth—The lan-
guage of the Jaredites is not confounded
at the Tower of Babel—The Lord prom-
ises to lead them to a choice land and
make them a great nation.

ND now I, Moroni, proceed to
give an “account of those an-
cient inhabitants who were
destroyed by the "hand of the
Lord upon the face of this north
country.
2 And I take mine account from
the “twenty and four plates which

were found by the people of Limhi,
which is called the Book of Ether.

3 And as I suppose that the “first
part of this record, which speaks
concerning the creation of the
world, and also of Adam, and an
account from that time even to the
great ‘tower, and whatsoever things
transpired among the children of
men until that time, is had among
the Jews—

4 Therefore I do not write those
things which transpired from the
“days of Adam until that time; but
they are had upon the plates; and
whoso findeth them, the same will
have power that he may get the full
account.

5 But behold, I give not the full
account, but a “part of the account
I give, from the tower down until
they were destroyed.

6 And on this wise do I give the
account. He that wrote this record
was “Ether, and he was a descen-
dant of Coriantor.

7 Coriantor was the son of Moron.

8 And Moron was the son of Ethem.

9 And Ethem was the son of Ahah.

10 And Ahah was the son of Seth.

11 And Seth was the son of Shiblon.

12 And Shiblon was the son of Com.

13 And Com was the son of Cori-
antum,

14 And Coriantum was the son of
Amnigaddah.

15 And Amnigaddah was the son
of Aaron.

16 And Aaron was a descendant of
Heth, who was the son of Hearthom.

17 And Hearthom was the son of
Lib.

18 And Lib was the son of Kish.

19 And Kish was the son of Corom.,

20 And Corom was the son of Levi.

21 And Levi was the son of Kim.

22 And Kim was the son of
Morianton,

 

488

23 And Morianton was a descen-
dant of Riplakish.

24 And Riplakish was the son of
Shez.

25 And Shez was the son of Heth.

26 And Heth was the son of Com.

27 And Com was the son of Cori-
antum.

28 And Coriantum was the son
of Emer.

29 And Emer was the son of Omer.

30 And Omer was the son of Shule.

31 And Shule was the son of Kib.

32 And “Kib was the son of °Ori-
hah, who was the son of Jared;

33 Which “Jared came forth with
his brother and their families, with
some others and their families, from
the great tower, at the time the Lord
’confounded the language of the
people, and swore in his wrath that
they should be scattered upon all
the ‘face of the earth; and according
to the word of the Lord the people
were scattered.

34 And the “brother of Jared be-
ing a large and mighty man, and
a man highly favored of the Lord,
Jared, his brother, said unto him:
Cry unto the Lord, that he will not
confound us that we may not °un-
derstand our words,

35 And it came to pass that the
brother of Jared did cry unto the
Lord, and the Lord had compassion
upon Jared; therefore he did not
confound the “language of Jared;
and Jared and his brother were not
confounded.

36 Then Jared said unto his
brother: Cry again unto the Lord,
and it may be that he will turn away
his anger from them who are our
“friends, that he confound not their
language.

37 And it came to pass that the
brother of Jared did cry unto the
Lord, and the Lord had compassion

upon their friends and their families
also, that they were not confounded.

38 And it came to pass that Jared
spake again unto his brother, say-
ing: Go and “inquire of the Lord
whether he will drive us out of the
land, and if he will drive us out of
the land, cry unto him whither we
shall go. And who knoweth but the
Lord will carry us forth into a land
which is "choice above all the earth?
And if it so be, let us be faithful
unto the Lord, that we may receive
it for our inheritance.

39 And it came to pass that the
brother of Jared did cry unto the
Lord according to that which had
been spoken by the mouth of Jared.

40 And it came to pass that the
Lord did hear the brother of Jared,
and “had compassion upon him,
and said unto him:

41 Go to and gather together thy
“flocks, both male and female, of
every kind; and also of the "seed of
the earth of every kind; and ‘thy
“families; and also Jared thy brother
and his family; and also thy ‘friends
and their families, and the friends
of Jared and their families.

42 And when thou hast done this
thou shalt “go at the head of them
down into the valley which is north-
ward. And there will I meet thee,
and I will go "before thee into a
land which is ‘choice above all the
lands of the earth.

43 And there will I bless thee and
thy seed, and raise up unto me of thy
seed, and of the seed of thy brother,
and they who shall go with thee,
a great nation. And “there shall be
none ’greater than the nation which
I will raise up unto me of thy seed,
upon all the face of the earth. And

 

ETHER 1:38-2:5

thus I will do unto thee because this
long time ye have cried unto me.

CHAPTER 2

The Jaredites prepare for their jour-
ney to a promised land—lt is a choice
land whereon men must serve Christ
or be swept off—The Lord talks to the
brother of Jared for three hours—The
Jaredites build barges—The Lord asks
the brother of Jared to propose how the
barges will be lighted.

AND it came to pass that Jared and
his brother, and their families,
and also the “friends of Jared and
his brother and their families, went
down into the valley which was
northward, (and the name of the
valley was "Nimrod, being called
after the mighty hunter) with their
‘flocks which they had gathered to-
gether, male and female, of every
kind.

2 And they did also lay snares and
catch “fowls of the air; and they
did also prepare a vessel, in which
they did carry with them the fish
of the waters.

3 And they did also carry with
them deseret, which, by interpreta-
tion, is a honey bee; and thus they
did carry with them “swarms of bees,
and all manner of that which was
upon the face of the land, ’seeds
of every kind.

4 And it came to pass that when
they had come down into the valley
of Nimrod the Lord came down and
talked with the brother of Jared; and
he was ina “cloud, and the brother
of Jared saw him not.

5 And it came to pass that the Lord
commanded them that they should
*90 forth into the wilderness, yea,

into that quarter where there never
had man been. And it came to pass
that the Lord did go before them,
and did talk with them as he stood
in a ’cloud, and gave ‘directions
whither they should travel.

6 And it came to pass that they
did travel in the wilderness, and did
“build "barges, in which they did
cross many waters, being directed
continually by the hand of the Lord.

7 And the Lord would not suffer
that they should stop beyond the
sea in the wilderness, but he would
that they should come forth even
unto the “land of promise, which
was choice above all other lands,
which the Lord God had ’preserved
for a righteous people.

8 And he had sworn in his wrath
unto the brother of Jared, that
whoso should possess this land of
promise, from that time henceforth
and forever, should “serve him, the
true and only God, or they should
be "swept off when the fulness of
his wrath should come upon them.

9 And now, we can behold the de-
crees of God concerning this land,
that it is a land of promise; and
whatsoever nation shall possess it
shall serve God, or they shall be
“swept off when the fulness of his
wrath shall come upon them. And
the fulness of his wrath cometh
upon them when they are ‘ripened
in iniquity.

10 For behold, this is a land which
is choice above all other lands;
wherefore he that doth possess it
shall serve God or shall be “swept
off; for it is the everlasting decree of
God, And it is not until the ’fulness
of iniquity among the children of
the land, that they are ‘swept off.

 

490

11 And this cometh unto you, O
ye “Gentiles, that ye may know the
decrees of God—that ye may repent,
and not continue in your iniqui-
ties until the fulness come, that
ye may not bring down the fulness
of the ’wrath of God upon you as
the inhabitants of the land have
hitherto done.

12 Behold, this is a choice land,
and whatsoever nation shall pos-
sess it shall be “free from bondage,
and from captivity, and from all
other nations under heaven, if they
will but "serve the God of the land,
who is Jesus Christ, who hath been
manifested by the things which we
have written.

13 And now I proceed with my
record; for behold, it came to pass
that the Lord did bring Jared and
his brethren forth even to that great
sea which divideth the lands, And
as they came to the sea they pitched
their tents; and they called the
name of the place *“Moriancumer;
and they dwelt in *tents, and dwelt
in tents upon the seashore for the
space of four years.

14 And it came to pass at the end
of four years that the Lord came
again unto the brother of Jared,
and stood in a cloud and “talked
with him. And for the space of three
hours did the Lord talk with the
brother of Jared, and °chastened
him because he remembered not
to ‘call upon the name of the Lord.

15 And the brother of Jared re-
pented of the evil which he had done,
and did call upon the name of the
Lord for his brethren who were with
him, And the Lord said unto him: I
will forgive thee and thy brethren
of their sins; but thou shalt not sin

any more, for ye shall remember that
my “Spirit will not always °strive
with man; wherefore, if ye will sin
until ye are fully ripe ye shall be cut
off from the presence of the Lord.
And these are my ‘thoughts upon
the land which I shall give you for
your inheritance; for it shall bea
land “choice above all other lands.

16 And the Lord said: Go to work
and build, after the manner of
“barges which ye have hitherto
built. And it came to pass that the
brother of Jared did go to work, and
also his brethren, and built barges
after the manner which they had
built, according to the *instructions
of the Lord. And they were small,
and they were light upon the wa-
ter, even like unto the lightness of
a fowl upon the water.

17 And they were built after a
manner that they were exceedingly
“tight, even that they would hold wa-
ter like unto a dish; and the bottom
thereof was tight like unto a dish;
and the sides thereof were tight like
unto a dish; and the ends thereof
were peaked; and the top thereof
was tight like unto a dish; and the
length thereof was the length of a
tree; and the door thereof, when
it was shut, was tight like unto
a dish.

18 And it came to pass that the
brother of Jared cried unto the Lord,
saying: O Lord, [have performed the
work which thou hast commanded
me, and I have made the barges ac-
cording as thou hast directed me.

19 And behold, O Lord, in them
there is no light; whither shall we
steer? And also we shall perish, for
in them we cannot breathe, save it
is the air which is in them; there-
fore we shall perish.

 

ETHER 2:16-25

20 And the Lord said unto the
brother of Jared: Behold, thou shalt
make a hole in the top, and also in
the bottom; and when thou shalt
suffer for air thou shalt unstop the
hole and receive air. And if it be so
that the water come in upon thee,
behold, ye shall stop the hole, that ye
may not perish in the flood.

21 And it came to pass that the
brother of Jared did so, according
as the Lord had commanded.

22 And he cried again unto the
Lord saying: O Lord, behold I have
done even as thou hast commanded
me; and I have prepared the vessels
for my people, and behold there is
no light in them. Behold, O Lord,
wilt thou suffer that we shall cross
this great water in darkness?

23 And the Lord said unto the
brother of Jared: What will ye that
I should do that ye may have light
in your vessels? For behold, ye can-
not have “windows, for they will be
dashed in pieces; neither shall ye
take fire with you, for ye shall not
go by the light of fire.

24 For behold, ye shall be as a
“whale in the midst of the sea; for
the mountain waves shall dash upon
you. Nevertheless, I will bring you
up again out of the depths of the
sea; for the °winds have gone forth
‘out of my mouth, and also the “rains
and the floods have I sent forth.

25 And behold, I prepare you
against these things; for ye cannot
cross this great deep save I prepare
you against the waves of the sea, and
the winds which have gone forth,
and the floods which shall come.
Therefore what will ye that I should
prepare for you that ye may have
light when ye are swallowed up in
the depths of the sea?

CHAPTER 3

The brother of Jared sees the finger of
the Lord as He touches sixteen stones—
Christ shows His spirit body to the
brother of Jared—Those who have a
perfect knowledge cannot be kept from
within the veil—iInterpreters are pro-
vided to bring the Jaredite record to light.

AND it came to pass that the brother
of Jared, (now the number of the
vessels which had been prepared
was eight) went forth unto the
“mount, which they called the mount
’Shelem, because of its exceeding
height, and did ‘molten out of a rock
sixteen small stones; and they were
white and clear, even as transpar-
ent “glass; and he did carry them
in his hands upon the top of the
mount, and cried again unto the
Lord, saying:

2 O Lord, thou hast said that we
must be encompassed about by the
floods, Now behold, O Lord, and do
not be “angry with thy servant be-
cause of his weakness before thee;
for we know that thou art holy and
dwellest in the heavens, and that
we are unworthy before thee; be-
cause of the ‘fall our ¢natures have
become evil continually; neverthe-
less, O Lord, thou hast given us a
commandment that we must call
upon thee, that from thee we may
receive according to our desires.

3 Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten
us because of our iniquity, and hast
driven us forth, and for these many
years we have been in the wilder-
ness; nevertheless, thou hast been
*merciful unto us. O Lord, look upon
me in pity, and turn away thine an-
ger from this thy people, and suffer
not that they shall go forth across

 

492

this raging deep in darkness; but
behold these *things which I have
molten out of the rock.

4 And I know, O Lord, that thou
hast all “power, and can do what-
soever thou wilt for the benefit of
man; therefore touch these stones, O
Lord, with thy ’finger, and prepare
them that they may shine forth in
darkness; and they shall shine forth
unto us in the vessels which we
have prepared, that we may have
‘light while we shall cross the sea.

5 Behold, O Lord, thou canst do
this. We know that thou art able
to show forth great power, which
“looks small unto the understand-
ing of men.

6 And it came to pass that when
the brother of Jared had said these
words, behold, the “Lord stretched
forth his hand and touched the
stones one by one with his finger.
And the ‘veil was taken from off the
eyes of the brother of Jared, and he
saw the finger of the Lord; and it
was as the finger of a man, like unto
flesh and blood; and the brother of
Jared “fell down before the Lord,
for he was struck with ‘fear.

7 And the Lord saw that the
brother of Jared had fallen to the
earth; and the Lord said unto him:
Arise, why hast thou fallen?

8 And he saith unto the Lord: I
saw the finger of the Lord, and
I feared lest he should “smite me;
for I knew not that the Lord had
flesh and blood.

9 And the Lord said unto him:
Because of thy faith thou hast seen
that I shall take upon me “flesh and
blood; and never has man come be-
fore me with "such exceeding faith
as thou hast; for were it not so ye

could not have seen my finger. Saw-
est thou more than this?

10 And he answered: Nay; Lord,
“show thyself unto me.

11 And the Lord said unto him:
*Believest thou the words which I
shall speak?

12 And he answered: Yea, Lord, I
know that thou speakest the truth,
for thou art a God of truth, and
4canst not lie.

13 And when he had said these
words, behold, the Lord “showed
himself unto him, and said: ’Be-
cause thou Knowest these things ye
are redeemed from the fall; there-
fore ye are brought back into my
“presence; therefore I¢show myself
unto you.

14 Behold, Iam he who was “pre-
pared from the foundation of the
world to *’redeem my people. Behold,
Iam Jesus Christ. 1 am the ‘Father
and the Son. In me shall all man-
kind have “life, and that eternally,
even they who shall believe on my
name; and they shall become my
“sons and my daughters.

15 And never have I “showed my-
self unto man whom I have created,
for never has man “believed in me
as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are
created after mine own ‘image? Yea,
even all men were created in the
beginning after mine own image.

16 Behold, this “body, which ye
now °behold, is the ‘body of my
4spirit; and man have I created af-
ter the body of my spirit; and even
as | appear unto thee to be in the

 

ETHER 3:10-21

spirit willl appear unto my people
in the flesh.

17 And now, as I, Moroni, said I
could “not make a full account of
these things which are written,
therefore it sufficeth me to say
that Jesus showed himself unto
this man in the spirit, even after
the manner and in the likeness of
the same body even as he "showed
himself unto the Nephites.

18 And he ministered unto him
even as he ministered unto the
Nephites; and all this, that this man
might know that he was God, because
of the many great works which the
Lord had showed unto him.

19 And because of the “knowledge
of this man he could not be kept
from beholding within the veil; and
he saw the finger of Jesus, which,
when he saw, he fell with fear; for
he knew that it was the finger of
the Lord; and he had ‘faith no lon-
ger, for he knew, nothing ‘doubting.

20 Wherefore, having this perfect
knowledge of God, he could “not be
kept from within the veil; therefore
he ’saw Jesus; and he did minister
unto him.

21 And it came to pass that the
Lord said unto the brother of Jared:
Behold, thou shalt not suffer these
things which ye have seen and heard
to go forth unto the world, until the
“time cometh that I shall glorify my
name in the flesh; wherefore, ye
shall "treasure up the things which
ye have seen and heard, and show
it to no man,

22 And behold, when ye shall come
unto me, ye shall write them and
shall seal them up, that no one can
interpret them; for ye shall write
them in a “language that they can-
not be read.

23 And behold, these “two stones
will I give unto thee, and ye shall
seal them up also with the things
which ye shall write.

24 For behold, the “language which
ye shall write I have confounded;
wherefore I will cause in my own
due time that these stones shall
magnify to the eyes of men these
things which ye shall write.

25 And when the Lord had said
these words, he “showed unto the
brother of Jared "all the inhabi-
tants of the earth which had been,
and also all that would be; and he
‘withheld them not from his sight,
even unto the ends of the earth.

26 For he had said unto him in
times before, that “if he would "be-
lieve in him that he could show unto
him ‘all things—it should be shown
unto him; therefore the Lord could
not withhold anything from him,
for he knew that the Lord could
show him all things.

27 And the Lord said unto him:
Write these things and “seal them
up; and I will show them in mine
own due time unto the children of
men.

28 And it came to pass that the
Lord commanded him that he
should seal up the two “stones which
he had received, and show them not,
until the Lord should show them
unto the children of "men.

CHAPTER 4

Moroni is commanded to seal up the
writings of the brother of Jared—They
will not be revealed until men have faith
even as the brother of Jared—Christ
commands men to believe His words
and those of His disciples—Men are
commanded to repent, believe the gos-
pel, and be saved.

AND the Lord commanded the
brother of Jared to go down out of
the “mount from the presence of the
Lord, and >write the things which
he had seen; and they were forbid-
den to come unto the children of
men ‘until after that he should be
lifted up upon the cross; and for this
cause did king Mosiah keep them,
that they should not come unto the
world until after Christ should show
himself unto his people.

2 And after Christ truly had showed
himself unto his people he com-
manded that they should be made
manifest.

3 And now, after that, they have
all dwindled in unbelief; and there
is “none save it be the Lamanites,
and they have rejected the gospel of
Christ; therefore lam commanded
that I should "hide them up again
in the earth.

4 Behold, I have written upon these
plates the ¢very things which the
brother of Jared saw; and there never
were ’greater things made mani-
fest than those which were made
manifest unto the brother of Jared.

5 Wherefore the Lord hath com-
manded me to write them; and [have
written them, And he commanded

me that I should “seal them up;
and he also hath commanded that
I should seal up the interpretation
thereof; wherefore I have sealed up
the interpreters, according to the
commandment of the Lord.

6 For the Lord said unto me: They
shall not go forth unto the Gentiles
until the day that they shall repent
of their iniquity, and become clean
before the Lord.

7 And in that day that they shall
exercise “faith in me, saith the Lord,
even as the brother of Jared did, that
they may become ’sanctified in me,
then will 1 ‘manifest unto them the
things which the brother of Jared
saw, even to the unfolding unto
them all my “revelations, saith Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, the ‘Father
of the heavens and of the earth, and
all things that in them are.

8 And he that will ¢contend against
the word of the Lord, let him be
accursed; and he that shall "deny
these things, let him be accursed;
for unto them will I show ‘no greater
things, saith Jesus Christ; for Iam
he who speaketh.

9 And at my command the heav-
ens are opened and are “shut; and
at my word the "earth shall shake;
and at my command the inhabitants
thereof shall pass away, even so as
by fire.

10 And he that believeth not my
words believeth not my disciples;
and if it so be that I do not speak,
judge ye; for ye shall know that it
is | that speaketh, at the “last day.

11 But he that ¢believeth these

 

ETHER 4:6-15

things which I have spoken, him
will I visit with the manifestations
of my Spirit, and he shall *know
and bear record. For because of
my Spirit he shall ‘know that these
things are “true; for it persuadeth
men to do good.

12 And whatsoever thing persuad-
eth men to do good is of me; for
“900d cometh of none save it be of
me. 1am the same that leadeth men
to all good; he that will *not believe
my words will not believe me—that
lam; and he that will not believe me
will not believe the Father who sent
me. For behold, I am the Father, I
am the ‘light, and the “life, and the
‘truth of the world.

and I will show unto you the greater

up because of unbelief.

14 Come unto me, O ye house of
Israel, and it shall be made “mani-

hath not come unto you, because of
unbelief.

15 Behold, when ye shall rend that

you to remain in your awful state of
wickedness, and hardness of heart,
and blindness of mind, then shall

which have been “hid up from the
foundation of the world from you—

remembered the covenant which
he made unto your fathers, O house
of Israel.

16 And then shall my “revelations
which I have caused to be written
by my servant John be unfolded in
the eyes of all the people. Remem-
ber, when ye see these things, ye
shall know that the time is at hand
that they shall be made manifest in
very deed.

17 Therefore, “when ye shall re-
ceive this record ye may Know that
the work of the Father has com-
menced upon all the face of the land.

18 Therefore, “repent all ye ends
of the earth, and come unto me,
and believe in my gospel, and be
’baptized in my name; for he that
believeth and is baptized shall be
saved; but he that believeth not shall
be damned; and ‘signs shall follow
them that believe in my name.

19 And blessed is he that is found
“faithful unto my name at the last
day, for he shall be “lifted up to
dwell in the kingdom prepared for
him ‘from the foundation of the
world. And behold it is I that hath
spoken it. Amen.

CHAPTER 5

Three witnesses and the work itself will
stand as a testimony of the truthfulness
of the Book of Mormon.

AND now I, Moroni, have written
the words which were commanded
me, according to my memory; and
I have told you the things which I
have ‘sealed up; therefore touch
them not in order that ye may
translate; for that thing is forbidden

 

496

you, except by and by it shall be
wisdom in God.

2 And behold, ye may be privi-
leged that ye may show the plates
unto “those who shall assist to bring
forth this work;

3 And unto “three shall they be
shown by the power of God; where-
fore they shall "know of a surety
that these things are ‘true.

4 And in the mouth of three ¢wit-
nesses shall these things be estab-
lished; and the "testimony of three,
and this work, in the which shall be
shown forth the power of God and
also his word, of which the Father,
and the Son, and the Holy Ghost
bear record—and all this shall stand
as a testimony against the world at
the last day.

5 And if it so be that they repent
and “come unto the Father in the
name of Jesus, they shall be received
into the kingdom of God.

6 And now, if I have no authority
for these things, judge ye; for ye shall
know that I have authority when
ye shall see me, and we shall stand
before God at the last day. Amen.

CHAPTER 6

The Jaredite barges are driven by the
winds to the promised land—The people
praise the Lord for His goodness—Ori-
hah is appointed king over them—Jared
and his brother die.

AND now I, Moroni, proceed to give
the record of “Jared and his brother.

2 For it came to pass after the Lord
had prepared the “stones which
the brother of Jared had carried up
into the mount, the brother of Jared

came down out of the mount, and
he did put forth the stones into the
vessels which were prepared, one
in each end thereof; and behold,
they did give light unto the vessels.

3 And thus the Lord caused stones
to shine in darkness, to give light
unto men, women, and children, that
they might not cross the great waters
in darkness.

4 And it came to pass that when
they had prepared all manner of
“food, that thereby they might sub-
sist upon the water, and also food for
their flocks and herds, and ’what-
soever beast or animal or fowl that
they should carry with them—and
it came to pass that when they had
done all these things they got aboard
of their vessels or barges, and set
forth into the sea, commending
themselves unto the Lord their God.

5 And it came to pass that the Lord
God caused that there should bea
*furious wind blow upon the face
of the waters, "towards the prom-
ised land; and thus they were tossed
upon the waves of the sea before
the wind.

6 And it came to pass that they
were many times buried in the
depths of the sea, because of the
mountain waves which broke upon
them, and also the great and terri-
ble tempests which were caused by
the fierceness of the wind.

7 And it came to pass that when
they were buried in the deep there
was no water that could hurt them,
their vessels being “tight like unto
a dish, and also they were tight
like unto the "ark of Noah; there-
fore when they were encompassed
about by many waters they did cry
unto the Lord, and he did bring
them forth again upon the top of
the waters.

 

ETHER 6:3-17

8 And it came to pass that the wind
did never cease to blow towards
the promised land while they were
upon the waters; and thus they were
“driven forth before the wind.

9 And they did “sing praises unto
the Lord; yea, the brother of Jared
did sing praises unto the Lord, and
he did "thank and praise the Lord
all the day long; and when the night
came, they did not cease to praise
the Lord.

10 And thus they were driven forth;
and no monster of the sea could
break them, neither “whale that
could mar them; and they did have
light continually, whether it was
above the water or under the water.

11 And thus they were driven
forth, “three hundred and forty and
four days upon the water.

12 And they did “land upon the
shore of the "promised land. And
when they had set their feet upon
the shores of the promised land they
bowed themselves down upon the
face of the land, and did humble
themselves before the Lord, and did
shed tears of joy before the Lord,
because of the multitude of his
‘tender mercies over them.

13 And it came to pass that they
went forth upon the face of the
land, and began to till the earth.

14 And Jared had four “sons; and
they were called Jacom, and Gilgah,
and Mahah, and Orihah.

15 And the brother of Jared also
begat sons and daughters.

16 And the “friends of Jared and
his brother were in number about
twenty and two souls; and they
also begat sons and daughters be-
fore they came to the promised
land; and therefore they began to
be many.

17 And they were taught to “walk

humbly before the Lord; and they
were also "taught from on high.

18 And it came to pass that they
began to spread upon the face of
the land, and to multiply and to till
the earth; and they did wax strong
in the land.

19 And the brother of Jared began
to be old, and saw that he must soon
go down to the grave; wherefore he
said unto Jared: Let us gather together
our people that we may number
them, that we may know of them
what they will desire of us before
we go down to our graves.

20 And accordingly the people
were gathered together. Now the
number of the sons and the daugh-
ters of the brother of Jared were
twenty and two souls; and the num-
ber of sons and daughters of Jared
were twelve, he having four sons.

21 And it came to pass that they
did number their people; and after
that they had numbered them, they
did desire of them the things which
they would that they should do be-
fore they went down to their graves.

22 And it came to pass that the
people desired of them that they
should “anoint one of their sons to
be a king over them.

23 And now behold, this was griev-
ous unto them. And the brother of
Jared said unto them: Surely this
thing “leadeth into captivity.

24 But Jared said unto his brother:
Suffer them that they may have a
king. And therefore he said unto
them: Choose ye out from among our
sons a king, even whom ye will.

25 And it came to pass that they
chose even the firstborn of the
brother of Jared; and his name was
Pagag. And it came to pass that he
refused and would not be their
“king. And the people would that
his father should constrain him,
but his father would not; and he

 

498

commanded them that they should
constrain no man to be their king.

26 And it came to pass that they
chose all the brothers of Pagag, and
they would not.

27 And it came to pass that neither
would the “sons of Jared, even all
save it were one; and °Orihah was
anointed to be king over the people.

28 And he began to reign, and the
people began to “prosper; and they
became exceedingly rich.

29 And it came to pass that Jared
died, and his brother also.

30 And it came to pass that Ori-
hah did walk humbly before the
Lord, and did remember how great
things the Lord had done for his
father, and also taught his people
how great things the Lord had done
for their fathers.

CHAPTER 7

Orihah reigns in righteousness—Amid
usurpation and strife, the rival king-
doms of Shule and Cohor are set up—
Prophets condemn the wickedness and
idolatry of the people, who then repent.

AND it came to pass that Orihah did
execute judgment upon the land in
righteousness all his days, whose
days were exceedingly many.

2 And he begat sons and daughters;
yea, he begat thirty and one, among
whom were twenty and three sons.

3 And it came to pass that he also
begat “Kib in his "old age. And it
came to pass that Kib reigned in
his stead; and Kib begat Corihor.

4 And when Corihor was thirty and
two years old he rebelled against his
father, and went over and dwelt in
the land of Nehor; and he begat sons
and daughters, and they became
exceedingly fair; wherefore Corihor
drew away many people after him.

gether an army he came up unto the

land of *Moron where the king
dwelt, and took him captive, which
’brought to pass the saying of the
brother of Jared that they would
be brought into captivity.

6 Now the “land of Moron, where
the king dwelt, was near the land
which is called Desolation by the
Nephites.

7 And it came to pass that Kib
dwelt in “captivity, and his people
under Corihor his son, until he be-
came exceedingly old; nevertheless
Kib begat Shule in his old age, while
he was yet in captivity.

8 And it came to pass that Shule
was angry with his brother; and
Shule waxed strong, and became
mighty as to the strength of a man;
and he was also mighty in judgment.

9 Wherefore, he came to the hill
Ephraim, and he did molten out of
the hill, and made swords out of
“steel for those whom he had drawn
away with him; and after he had
armed them with swords he returned
to the city Nehor, and gave battle
unto his brother Corihor, by which
means he obtained the kingdom
and restored it unto his father Kib.

10 And now because of the thing
which Shule had done, his father
bestowed upon him the kingdom;
therefore he began to reign in the
stead of his father.

11 And it came to pass that he did
execute judgment in righteousness;
and he did spread his kingdom upon
all the face of the land, for the people
had become exceedingly numerous.

12 And it came to pass that Shule
also begat many sons and daughters.

13 And Corihor repented of the
many evils which he had done;
wherefore Shule gave him power
in his kingdom.

14 And it came to pass that Corihor
had many sons and daughters. And
among the sons of Corihor there was
one whose name was Noah.

15 And it came to pass that Noah

 

ETHER 7:6-23

rebelled against Shule, the king, and
also his father Corihor, and drew
away Cohor his brother, and also all
his brethren and many of the people.

16 And he gave battle unto Shule,
the king, in which he did obtain the
land of their “first inheritance; and
he became a king over that part of
the land.

17 And it came to pass that he gave
battle again unto Shule, the king;
and he took Shule, the king, and car-
ried him away captive into Moron.

18 And it came to pass as he was
about to put him to death, the sons
of Shule crept into the house of
Noah by night and slew him, and
broke down the door of the prison
and brought out their father, and
placed him upon his throne in his
own kingdom.

19 Wherefore, the son of Noah did
build up his kingdom in his stead;
nevertheless they did not gain power
any more over Shule the king, and
the people who were under the
reign of Shule the king did prosper
exceedingly and wax great.

20 And the country was “divided;
and there were two kingdoms, the
kingdom of Shule, and the kingdom
of Cohor, the son of Noah.

21 And Cohor, the son of Noah,
caused that his people should give
battle unto Shule, in which Shule
did beat them and did slay Cohor.

22 And now Cohor had a son who
was called Nimrod; and Nimrod
gave up the kingdom of Cohor unto
Shule, and he did gain favor in the
eyes of Shule; wherefore Shule did
bestow great favors upon him, and
he did do in the kingdom of Shule
according to his desires.

23 And also in the reign of Shule
there came “prophets among the peo-
ple, who were sent from the Lord,
prophesying that the wickedness and
‘idolatry of the people was bringing a
curse upon the land, and they should
be destroyed if they did not repent.

24 And it came to pass that the peo-
ple did “revile against the prophets,
and did mock them. And it came
to pass that king Shule did execute
judgment against all those who did
revile against the prophets.

25 And he did execute a law
throughout all the land, which
gave power unto the prophets that
they should go whithersoever they
would; and by this cause the peo-
ple were brought unto repentance.

26 And because the people did re-
pent of their iniquities and idola-
tries the Lord did spare them, and
they began to prosper again in the
land. And it came to pass that Shule
*begat sons and daughters in his
old age.

27 And there were no more wars
in the days of Shule; and he remem-
bered the great things that the Lord
had done for his fathers in bringing
them across the great deep into the
promised land; wherefore he did
execute judgment in righteousness
all his days.

CHAPTER 8

There is strife and contention over the
kingdom—Akish forms an oath-bound
secret combination to slay the king—Se-
cret combinations are of the devil and
result in the destruction of nations—
Modern Gentiles are warned against
the secret combination that will seek
to overthrow the freedom of all lands,
nations, and countries.

AND it came to pass that he begat
Omer, and Omer reigned in his stead.
And Omer begat Jared; and Jared
begat sons and daughters.

2 And Jared rebelled against his
father, and came and dwelt in the
land of Heth. And it came to pass
that he did “flatter many people, be-
cause of his cunning words, until he
had gained the half of the kingdom.

 

500

3 And when he had gained the half
of the kingdom he gave battle unto
his father, and he did carry away
his father into captivity, and did
make him serve in captivity;

4 And now, in the days of the
reign of Omer he was in “captivity
the half of his days. And it came to
pass that he begat sons and daugh-
ters, among whom were Esrom and
Coriantumr;

5 And they were exceedingly an-
gry because of the doings of Jared
their brother, insomuch that they
did raise an army and gave battle
unto Jared. And it came to pass
that they did give battle unto him
by night.

6 And it came to pass that when
they had slain the army of Jared
they were about to slay him also;
and he pled with them that they
would not slay him, and he would
give up the kingdom unto his father.
And it came to pass that they did
grant unto him his life.

7 And now Jared became exceed-
ingly “sorrowful because of the loss
of the kingdom, for he had set his
heart upon the kingdom and upon
the glory of the world.

8 Now the daughter of Jared being
exceedingly expert, and seeing the
sorrows of her father, thought to
devise a plan whereby she could re-
deem the kingdom unto her father.

9 Now the daughter of Jared was
exceedingly fair. And it came to pass
that she did talk with her father,
and said unto him: Whereby hath
my father so much sorrow? Hath
he not read the “record which our
fathers brought across the great
deep? Behold, is there not an "ac-
count concerning them of ‘old, that
they by their “secret plans did
obtain kingdoms and great glory?

10 And now, therefore, let my
father send for Akish, the son of

Kimnor; and behold, Iam fair, and
I will dance before him, and I will
please him, that he will desire me
to wife; wherefore if he shall desire
of thee that ye shall give unto him
me to wife, then shall ye say: I will
give her if ye will bring unto me
the “head of my father, the king.

11 And now Omer was a friend
to Akish; wherefore, when Jared
had sent for Akish, the daughter
of Jared danced before him that
she pleased him, insomuch that he
desired her to wife. And it came to
pass that he said unto Jared: Give
her unto me to wife.

12 And Jared said unto him: I will
give her unto you, if ye will bring
unto me the head of my father, the
king.

13 And it came to pass that Akish
gathered in unto the house of Jared
all his kinsfolk, and said unto them:
Will ye swear unto me that ye will
be faithful unto me in the thing
which I shall desire of you?

14 And it came to pass that they
all “sware unto him, by the God of
heaven, and also by the heavens,
and also by the earth, and by their
heads, that whoso should vary from
the assistance which Akish desired
should lose his head; and whoso
should divulge whatsoever thing
Akish made known unto them, the
same should lose his life.

15 And it came to pass that thus
they did agree with “Akish. And
Akish did administer unto them the
oaths which were given by them of
old who also sought power, which
had been handed down even from
’Cain, who was a murderer from
the beginning.

16 And they were kept up by the
“power of the devil to administer
these oaths unto the people, to keep
them in darkness, to help such as

 

ETHER 8:11-23

sought power to gain power, and to
murder, and to plunder, and to lie,
and to commit all manner of wick-
edness and whoredoms.

17 And it was the daughter of
Jared who put it into his heart to
search up these things of old; and
Jared put it into the heart of Akish;
wherefore, Akish administered it
unto his kindred and friends, lead-
ing them away by fair promises to
do whatsoever thing he desired.

18 And it came to pass that they
formed a4secret combination, even
as they of old; which combination is
most abominable and wicked above
all, in the sight of God;

19 For the Lord worketh not in se-
cret combinations, neither doth he
will that man should shed blood,
but in all things hath forbidden it,
from the beginning of man.

20 And now I, Moroni, do not write
the manner of their oaths and com-
binations, for it hath been made
known unto me that they are had
“among all people, and they are
had among the Lamanites.

21 And they have caused the @de-
struction of this people of whom I
am now speaking, and also the de-
struction of the people of Nephi.

22 And whatsoever “nation shall
uphold such secret combinations,
to get power and gain, until they
shall spread over the nation, behold,
they shall be destroyed; for the Lord
will not suffer that the "blood of his
saints, which shall be shed by them,
shall always cry unto him from the
ground for ‘vengeance upon them
and yet he avenge them not.

23 Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is
wisdom in God that these things
should be shown unto you, that
thereby ye may repent of your sins,
and suffer not that these murderous
combinations shall get above you,

which are built up to get “power and
gain—and the work, yea, even the
work of destruction come upon you,
yea, even the sword of the justice of
the Eternal God shall fall upon you,
to your overthrow and destruction
if ye shall suffer these things to be.

24 Wherefore, the Lord command-
eth you, when ye shall see these
things come among you that ye
shall awake to a sense of your aw-
ful situation, because of this “secret
combination which shall be among
you; or wo be unto it, because of
the blood of them who have been
slain; for they cry from the dust for
vengeance upon it, and also upon
those who built it up.

25 For it cometh to pass that whoso
buildeth it up seeketh to overthrow
the “freedom of all lands, nations,
and countries; and it bringeth to
pass the destruction of all people,
for it is built up by the devil, who is
the father of all lies; even that same
liar who "beguiled our first parents,
yea, even that same liar who hath
caused man to commit murder from
the beginning; who hath ‘hardened
the hearts of men that they have
4murdered the prophets, and stoned
them, and cast them out from the
beginning.

26 Wherefore, I, Moroni, am com-
manded to write these things that
evil may be done away, and that
the time may come that Satan may
have “no power upon the hearts of
the children of men, but that they
may be "persuaded to do good con-
tinually, that they may come unto
the fountain of all ‘righteousness
and be saved.

CHAPTER 9

The kingdom passes from one to another
by descent, intrigue, and murder—

 

502

Emer saw the Son of Righteousness—
Many prophets cry repentance—A
famine and poisonous serpents plague
the people.

AND now I, Moroni, proceed with
my record. Therefore, behold, it
came to pass that because of the
*secret combinations of Akish and
his friends, behold, they did over-
throw the kingdom of Omer.

2 Nevertheless, the Lord was mer-
ciful unto Omer, and also to his sons
and to his daughters who did not
seek his destruction.

3 And the Lord “warned Omer
in a dream that he should depart
out of the land; wherefore Omer
’departed out of the land with his
family, and traveled many days, and
came over and passed by the hill of
‘Shim, and came over by the place
4where the Nephites were destroyed,
and from thence eastward, and
came to a place which was called
Ablom, by the seashore, and there
he pitched his tent, and also his
sons and his daughters, and all his
household, save it were Jared and
his family.

4 And it came to pass that Jared
was anointed king over the people,
by the hand of wickedness; and he
gave unto Akish his daughter to wife.

5 And it came to pass that Akish
sought the life of his father-in-law;
and he applied unto those whom
he had sworn by the "oath of the
ancients, and they obtained the
head of his father-in-law, as he sat
upon his throne, giving audience
to his people.

6 For so great had been the spread-
ing of this wicked and secret society
that it had corrupted the hearts of
all the people; therefore Jared was
murdered upon his throne, and
Akish reigned in his stead.

7 And it came to pass that Akish
began to be “jealous of his son,
therefore he shut him up in prison,
and kept him upon little or no food
until he had suffered death.

8 And now the brother of him that
suffered death, (and his name was
Nimrah) was angry with his father
because of that which his father
had done unto his brother.

9 And it came to pass that Nimrah
gathered together a small number of
men, and fled out of the land, and
came over and dwelt with Omer.

10 And it came to pass that Akish
begat other sons, and they won the
hearts of the people, notwithstand-
ing they had sworn unto him to do
all manner of iniquity according to
that which he desired.

11 Now the people of Akish were
desirous for gain, even as Akish was
desirous for “power; wherefore, the
sons of Akish did offer them *money,
by which means they drew away the
more part of the people after them.

12 And there began to be a war
between the sons of Akish and
Akish, which lasted for the space
of many years, yea, unto the de-
struction of nearly all the people
of the kingdom, yea, even all, save
it were thirty souls, and they who
fled with the house of Omer.

13 Wherefore, Omer was restored
again to the “land of his inheritance.

14 And it came to pass that Omer
began to be old; nevertheless, in
his old age he begat Emer; and he
anointed Emer to be king to reign
in his stead.

15 And after that he had anointed
Emer to be king he saw peace in
the land for the space of two years,
and he died, having seen exceed-
ingly many days, which were full
of sorrow. And it came to pass that
Emer did reign in his stead, and did
fill the steps of his father.

 

ETHER 9:7-23

16 And the Lord began again to
take the curse from off the land, and
the house of Emer did prosper ex-
ceedingly under the reign of Emer;
and in the space of sixty and two
years they had become exceedingly
strong, insomuch that they became
exceedingly rich—

17 Having “all manner of fruit,
and of grain, and of °silks, and of
fine linen, and of ‘gold, and of sil-
ver, and of precious things;

18 And also “all manner of cattle,
of oxen, and cows, and of sheep,
and of swine, and of goats, and also
many other kinds of animals which
were useful for the food of man.

19 And they also had “horses, and
asses, and there were elephants
and cureloms and cumoms; all of
which were useful unto man, and
more especially the elephants and
cureloms and cumoms.

20 And thus the Lord did pour out
his blessings upon this land, which
was “choice above all other lands;
and he commanded that whoso
should possess the land should
possess it unto the Lord, or they
should be ’destroyed when they
were ripened in iniquity; for upon
such, saith the Lord: I will pour out
the fulness of my wrath.

21 And Emer did execute judg-
ment in righteousness all his days,
and he begat many sons and daugh-
ters; and he begat Coriantum, and
he anointed Coriantum to reign in
his stead.

22 And after he had anointed
Coriantum to reign in his stead he
lived four years, and he saw peace
in the land; yea, and he even saw
the “Son of Righteousness, and did
rejoice and glory in his day; and he
died in peace.

23 And it came to pass that Corian-
tum did walk in the steps of his
father, and did build many mighty

cities, and did administer that which
was good unto his people in all his
days. And it came to pass that he
had no children even until he was
exceedingly “old.

24 And it came to pass that his
wife died, being an hundred and
two years old. And it came to pass
that Coriantum took to wife, in his
old age, a young maid, and begat
sons and daughters; wherefore he
lived until he was an hundred and
forty and two years old.

25 And it came to pass that he be-
gat Com, and Com reigned in his
stead; and he reigned forty and nine
years, and he begat Heth; and he
also begat other sons and daughters.

26 And the people had spread
again over all the face of the land,
and there began again to be an ex-
ceedingly great wickedness upon
the face of the land, and “Heth
began to embrace the secret plans
again of old, to destroy his father.

27 And it came to pass that he did
dethrone his father, for he slew him
with his own sword; and he did
reign in his stead.

28 And there came prophets in
the land “again, crying repentance
unto them—that they must pre-
pare the way of the Lord or there
should come a curse upon the face
of the land; yea, even there should
be a great famine, in which they
should be destroyed if they did not
repent.

29 But the people believed not the
words of the prophets, but they cast
them out; and some of them they
cast into “pits and left them to per-
ish. And it came to pass that they
did all these things according to the
commandment of the king, Heth.

30 And it came to pass that there
began to be a great “dearth upon the
land, and the inhabitants began to be
destroyed exceedingly fast because

 

504

of the dearth, for there was no rain
upon the face of the earth.

31 And there came forth “poison-
ous serpents also upon the face of
the land, and did poison many peo-
ple. And it came to pass that their
flocks began to flee before the poi-
sonous serpents, towards the land
’southward, which was called by
the Nephites ‘Zarahemla.

32 And it came to pass that there
were many of them which did per-
ish by the way; nevertheless, there
were some which fled into the land
southward.

33 And it came to pass that the
Lord did cause the “serpents that
they should pursue them no more,
but that they should hedge up the
way that the people could not pass,
that whoso should attempt to pass
might fall by the poisonous serpents.

34 And it came to pass that the
people did follow the course of the
beasts, and did devour the “carcasses
of them which fell by the way, until
they had devoured them all. Now
when the people saw that they must
’perish they began to ‘repent of their
iniquities and cry unto the Lord.

35 And it came to pass that when
they had “humbled themselves suffi-
ciently before the Lord he did send
rain upon the face of the earth; and
the people began to revive again,
and there began to be fruit in the
north countries, and in all the coun-
tries round about. And the Lord did
show forth his power unto them in
preserving them from famine.

CHAPTER 10

One king succeeds another—Some of the
kings are righteous; others are wicked—
When righteousness prevails, the people
are blessed and prospered by the Lord.

AND it came to pass that Shez, who
was a descendant of Heth—for

*Heth had perished by the famine,
and all his household save it were
Shez—wherefore, Shez began to
build up again a broken people.

2 And it came to pass that Shez
did remember the destruction of
his fathers, and he did build upa
righteous kingdom; for he remem-
bered what the Lord had done in
bringing Jared and his brother
“across the deep; and he did walk
in the ways of the Lord; and he be-
gat sons and daughters.

3 And his eldest son, whose name
was Shez, did “rebel against him;
nevertheless, Shez was smitten by
the hand of a robber, because of his
exceeding riches, which brought
peace again unto his father.

4 And it came to pass that his
father did build up many cities
upon the face of the land, and the
people began again to spread over
all the face of the land. And Shez
did live to an exceedingly old age;
and he begat Riplakish. And he died,
and Riplakish reigned in his stead.

5 And it came to pass that Rip-
lakish did not do that which was
right in the sight of the Lord, for he
did have many wives and “concu-
bines, and did lay that upon men’s
shoulders which was grievous to be
borne; yea, he did °tax them with
heavy taxes; and with the taxes he
did build many spacious buildings.

6 And he did erect him an exceed-
ingly beautiful throne; and he did
build many prisons, and whoso
would not be subject unto taxes he
did “cast into prison; and whoso was
not able to pay taxes he did cast
into prison; and he did cause that
they should labor continually for
their support; and whoso refused
to labor he did cause to be put
to death.

7 Wherefore he did obtain all his
fine work, yea, even his fine “gold
he did cause to be refined in prison;

 

ETHER 10:2-13

and all manner of fine °workman-
ship he did cause to be wrought
in prison. And it came to pass that
he did afflict the people with his
whoredoms and abominations.

8 And when he had reigned for the
space of forty and two years the peo-
ple did rise up in rebellion against
him; and there began to be war
again in the land, insomuch that
Riplakish was killed, and his descen-
dants were driven out of the land.

9 And it came to pass after the
space of many years, Morianton, (he
being a descendant of Riplakish)
gathered together an army of out-
casts, and went forth and gave bat-
tle unto the people; and he gained
power over many cities; and the war
became exceedingly sore, and did
last for the space of many years;
and he did gain power over all the
land, and did establish himself king
over all the land.

10 And after that he had estab-
lished himself king he did ease the
burden of the people, by which he
did gain favor in the eyes of the
people, and they did anoint him
to be their king.

11 And he did do justice unto
the people, but not unto himself
because of his many “whoredoms;
wherefore he was cut off from the
presence of the Lord.

12 And it came to pass that Mori-
anton built up many cities, and the
people became exceedingly rich
under his reign, both in buildings,
and in “gold and silver, and in rais-
ing grain, and in flocks, and herds,
and such things which had been
restored unto them.

13 And Morianton did live to an
exceedingly great age, and then he
begat Kim; and Kim did reign in
the stead of his father; and he did
reign eight years, and his father
died. And it came to pass that Kim
did “not reign in righteousness,

wherefore he was not favored of
the Lord.

14 And his brother did rise up in
rebellion against him, by which he
did bring him into “captivity; and
he did remain in captivity all his
days; and he begat sons and daugh-
ters in captivity, and in his old age
he begat Levi; and he died.

15 And it came to pass that Levi
did serve in captivity after the
death of his father, for the space
of forty and two years. And he did
make war against the king of the
land, by which he did obtain unto
himself the kingdom.

16 And after he had obtained
unto himself the kingdom he did
that which was right in the sight
of the Lord; and the people did
prosper in the land; and he did live
to a good “old age, and begat sons
and daughters; and he also begat
Corom, whom he anointed king in
his stead.

17 And it came to pass that Corom
did that which was good in the sight
of the Lord all his days; and he be-
gat many sons and daughters; and
after he had seen many days he did
pass away, even like unto the rest
of the earth; and Kish reigned in
his stead.

18 And it came to pass that Kish
passed away also, and Lib reigned
in his stead.

19 And it came to pass that Lib
also did that which was good in the
sight of the Lord. And in the days
of Lib the “poisonous serpents were
destroyed. Wherefore they did go
into the land southward, to hunt
food for the people of the land, for
the land was covered with animals
of the forest. And Lib also himself
became a great "hunter.

20 And they built a great city by

 

506

the “narrow neck of land, by the
place where the sea divides the land.

21 And they did preserve the land
*southward for a wilderness, to get
game. And the whole face of the
land northward was covered with
inhabitants.

22 And they were exceedingly
“industrious, and they did buy and
sell and °traffic one with another,
that they might get gain.

23 And they did ¢work in all man-
ner of "ore, and they did make gold,
and silver, and ‘iron, and “brass,
and all manner of metals; and they
did dig it out of the earth; where-
fore, they did cast up mighty heaps
of earth to get ore, of gold, and of
silver, and of iron, and of copper.
And they did ‘work all manner of
fine work.

24 And they did have “silks, and
fine-twined *linen; and they did
work all manner of ‘cloth, that they
might clothe themselves from their
nakedness.

25 And they did make all man-
ner of tools to till the earth, both
to plow and to sow, to reap and to
hoe, and also to thrash.

26 And they did make all manner
of tools with which they did work
their beasts.

27 And they did make all manner
of “weapons of war. And they did
work all manner of work of exceed-
ingly curious workmanship.

28 And never could be a people
more blessed than were they, and
more prospered by the hand of the
Lord. And they were in a land that
was choice above all lands, for the
Lord had spoken it.

29 And it came to pass that Lib
did live many years, and begat sons
and daughters; and he also begat
Hearthom.

30 And it came to pass that
Hearthom reigned in the stead of
his father. And when Hearthom had
reigned twenty and four years, be-
hold, the kingdom was taken away
from him. And he served many
years in “captivity, yea, even all the
remainder of his days.

31 And he begat Heth, and Heth
lived in captivity all his days. And
Heth begat Aaron, and Aaron dwelt
in captivity all his days; and he be-
gat Amnigaddah, and Amnigaddah
also dwelt in captivity all his days;
and he begat Coriantum, and Cori-
antum dwelt in captivity all his
days; and he begat Com.

32 And it came to pass that Com
drew away the half of the kingdom.
And he reigned over the half of
the kingdom forty and two years;
and he went to battle against the
king, Amgid, and they fought for
the space of many years, during
which time Com gained power over
Amgid, and obtained power over the
remainder of the kingdom.

33 And in the days of Com there
began to be robbers in the land; and
they adopted the old plans, and ad-
ministered “oaths after the manner
of the ancients, and sought again
to destroy the kingdom.

34 Now Com did fight against
them much; nevertheless, he did
not prevail against them.

CHAPTER 11

Wars, dissensions, and wickedness
dominate Jaredite life—Prophets predict
the utter destruction of the Jaredites
unless they repent—The people reject
the words of the prophets.

AND there came also in the days of
Com many “prophets, and prophe-
sied of the destruction of that great
people except they should repent,
and turn unto the Lord, and forsake
their murders and wickedness.

 

ETHER 10:30-11:10

2 And it came to pass that the
prophets were “rejected by the
people, and they fled unto Com for
protection, for the people sought to
destroy them.

3 And they prophesied unto Com
many things; and he was blessed in
all the remainder of his days.

4 And he lived to a good old age,
and begat Shiblom; and Shiblom
reigned in his stead. And the brother
of Shiblom rebelled against him,
and there began to be an exceed-
ingly great war in all the land.

5 And it came to pass that the
brother of Shiblom caused that all
the prophets who prophesied of the
destruction of the people should be
put to “death;

6 And there was great calamity in
all the land, for they had testified
that a great curse should come upon
the land, and also upon the people,
and that there should be a great de-
struction among them, such an one
as never had been upon the face of
the earth, and their bones should
become as “heaps of earth upon the
face of the land except they should
repent of their wickedness.

7 And they hearkened not unto the
voice of the Lord, because of their
wicked combinations; wherefore,
there began to be wars and “conten-
tions in all the land, and also many
famines and pestilences, insomuch
that there was a great destruction,
such an one as never had been
known upon the face of the earth;
and all this came to pass in the days
of Shiblom.

8 And the people began to repent
of their iniquity; and inasmuch as
they did the Lord did have “mercy
on them.

9 And it came to pass that Shiblom
was slain, and Seth was brought
into “captivity, and did dwell in
captivity all his days.

10 And it came to pass that Ahah,

his son, did obtain the kingdom; and
he did reign over the people all his
days. And he did do all manner of
iniquity in his days, by which he
did cause the shedding of much
blood; and few were his days.

11 And Ethem, being a descendant
of Ahah, did obtain the kingdom;
and he also did do that which was
wicked in his days.

12 And it came to pass that in the
days of Ethem there came many
prophets, and prophesied again
unto the people; yea, they did proph-
esy that the Lord would utterly
“destroy them from off the face of
the earth except they repented of
their iniquities.

13 And it came to pass that the
people hardened their hearts, and
would not “hearken unto their words;
and the prophets "mourned and
withdrew from among the people.

14 And it came to pass that Ethem
did execute judgment in wicked-
ness all his days; and he begat Mo-
ron. And it came to pass that Moron
did reign in his stead; and Moron did
that which was wicked before the
Lord.

15 And it came to pass that there
arose a “rebellion among the people,
because of that secret combination
which was built up to get power and
gain; and there arose a mighty man
among them in iniquity, and gave
battle unto Moron, in which he did
overthrow the half of the kingdom;
and he did maintain the half of the
kingdom for many years.

16 And it came to pass that Moron
did overthrow him, and did obtain
the kingdom again.

17 And it came to pass that there
arose another mighty man; and he
was a descendant of the brother

 

of Jared.

508

18 And it came to pass that he did
overthrow Moron and obtain the
kingdom; wherefore, Moron dwelt
in “captivity all the remainder of
his days; and he begat Coriantor.

19 And it came to pass that
Coriantor dwelt in captivity all
his days.

20 And in the days of Coriantor
there also came many prophets,
and prophesied of great and mar-
velous things, and cried repentance
unto the people, and except they
should repent the Lord God would
execute “judgment against them to
their utter destruction;

21 And that the Lord God would
send or bring forth “another peo-
ple to possess the "land, by his
power, after the manner by which
he brought their fathers.

22 And they did “reject all the
words of the prophets, because of
their ’secret society and wicked
abominations.

23 And it came to pass that Corian-
tor begat “Ether, and he died, hav-
ing dwelt in captivity all his days.

CHAPTER 12

The prophet Ether exhorts the people
to believe in God—Moroni recounts the
wonders and marvels done by faith—
Faith enabled the brother of Jared to
see Christ—The Lord gives men weak-
ness that they may be humble—The
brother of Jared moved Mount Zerin
by faith—Faith, hope, and charity are
essential to salvation—Moroni saw
Jesus face to face.

AND it came to pass that the days
of Ether were in the days of *Cori-
antumr; and Coriantumr was king
over all the land.

Lord; wherefore Ether came forth

in the days of Coriantumr, and be-
gan to prophesy unto the people,
for he could not be "restrained
because of the Spirit of the Lord
which was in him.

3 For he did “cry from the "morn-
ing, even until the going down of
the sun, exhorting the people to
believe in God unto repentance lest
they should be ‘destroyed, saying
unto them that “by ‘faith all things
are fulfilled—

4 Wherefore, whoso believeth in
God might with ¢surety “hope for
a better world, yea, even a place at
the right hand of God, which ‘hope
cometh of “faith, maketh an ‘anchor
to the souls of men, which would
make them sure and steadfast, al-
ways abounding in ‘good works,
being led to *glorify God.

5 And it came to pass that Ether
did prophesy great and marvelous
things unto the people, which they
did not believe, because they “saw
them not.

6 And now, I, Moroni, would speak
somewhat concerning these things;
I would show unto the world that
“faith is things which are "hoped
for and ‘not seen; wherefore, dis-
pute not because ye see not, for ye
receive no “witness until after the
*trial of your faith.

7 For it was by faith that Christ
showed himself unto our fathers,
after he had risen from the dead;
and he showed not himself unto
them until after they had faith
in him; wherefore, it must needs

 

ETHER 12:3-16

be that some had faith in him,
for he showed himself ¢not unto
the world.

8 But because of the faith of men
he has shown himself unto the
world, and glorified the name of
the Father, and prepared a way that
thereby others might be partakers
of the heavenly gift, that they might
hope for those things which they
have not seen.

9 Wherefore, ye may also have
hope, and be partakers of the gift,
if ye will but have faith.

10 Behold it was by faith that they
of old were “called after the holy
order of God.

11 Wherefore, by faith was the law
of Moses given. But in the “gift of
his Son hath God prepared a more
’excellent way; and it is by faith
that it hath been fulfilled.

12 For if there be no “faith among
the children of men God can do no
’miracle among them; wherefore,
he showed not himself until after
their faith.

13 Behold, it was the faith of Alma
and Amulek that caused the “prison
to tumble to the earth.

14 Behold, it was the faith of
Nephi and Lehi that wrought the
“change upon the Lamanites, that
they were baptized with fire and
with the "Holy Ghost.

15 Behold, it was the faith of
“Ammon and his brethren which
’wrought so great a miracle among
the Lamanites.

wrought “miracles wrought them by
‘faith, even those who were before
Christ and also those who were after.

17 And it was by faith that the
three disciples obtained a promise
that they should ¢not taste of death;
and they obtained not the promise
until after their faith.

18 And neither at any time hath
any wrought miracles until after
their faith; wherefore they first
believed in the Son of God.

19 And there were many whose
faith was so exceedingly strong,
even “before Christ came, who could
not be kept from within the °veil,
but truly saw with their eyes the
things which they had beheld with
an eye of faith, and they were glad.

20 And behold, we have seen in
this record that one of these was the
brother of Jared; for so great was
his faith in God, that when God put
forth his “finger he could not hide
it from the sight of the brother of
Jared, because of his word which he
had spoken unto him, which word
he had obtained by faith.

21 And after the brother of Jared
had beheld the finger of the Lord,
because of the “promise which the
brother of Jared had obtained by
faith, the Lord could not withhold
anything from his sight; wherefore
he showed him all things, for he could
no longer be kept without the veil.

22 And it is by faith that my fathers
have obtained the “promise that
these things should come unto
their brethren through the Gentiles;
therefore the Lord hath commanded
me, yea, even Jesus Christ.

 

510

23 And I said unto him: Lord, the
Gentiles will mock at these things,
because of our ’weakness in writing;
for Lord thou hast made us ‘mighty
in word by faith, but thou hast not
made us mighty in writing; for thou
hast made all this people that they
could speak much, because of the
Holy Ghost which thou hast given
them;

24 And thou hast made us that we
could write but little, because of
the “awkwardness of our hands, Be-
hold, thou hast not made us mighty
in writing like unto the brother
of Jared, for thou madest him that
the things which he ‘wrote were
mighty even as thou art, unto the
overpowering of man to read them.

25 Thou hast also made our words
powerful and great, even that we
“cannot write them; wherefore, when
we write we behold our ’weakness,
and stumble because of the plac-
ing of our words; and I fear lest the
Gentiles shall ‘mock at our words.

26 And when I had said this, the
Lord spake unto me, saying: “Fools
b’mock, but they shall mourn; and
my grace is sufficient for the meek,
that they shall take no advantage
of your weakness;

27 And if men come unto me I
will show unto them their “weak-
ness. I ’give unto men weakness
that they may be humble; and my
‘grace is sufficient for all men that
“humble themselves before me; for
if they humble themselves before
me, and have faith in me, then will
I make ‘weak things become strong
unto them,

28 Behold, I will show unto the
Gentiles their weakness, and I will
show unto them that “faith, hope
and charity bringeth unto me—the
fountain of all ’righteousness.

29 And I, Moroni, having heard
these words, was “comforted, and
said: O Lord, thy righteous will be
done, for I know that thou workest
unto the children of men according
to their faith;

30 For the brother of Jared said
unto the mountain Zerin, “*Re-
move—and it was removed. And if
he had not had faith it would not
have moved; wherefore thou work-
est after men have faith.

31 For thus didst thou manifest
thyself unto thy disciples; for “after
they had faith, and did speak in
thy name, thou didst show thyself
unto them in great power.

32 And lalso remember that thou
hast said that thou hast prepared a
house for man, yea, even among the
*mansions of thy Father, in which
man might have a more excellent
*hope; wherefore man must hope,
or he cannot receive an inheri-
tance in the place which thou hast
prepared.

33 And again, I remember that
thou hast said that thou hast “loved
the world, even unto the laying
down of thy life for the world, that
thou mightest take it again to pre-
pare a place for the children of men.

34 And now I know that this “love
which thou hast had for the chil-
dren of men is charity; wherefore,
except men shall have charity they
cannot inherit that place which thou

 

ETHER 12:28-41

hast prepared in the mansions of
thy Father.

35 Wherefore, I know by this thing
which thou hast said, that if the
Gentiles have not “charity, because
of our weakness, that thou wilt
prove them, and “take away their
‘talent, yea, even that which they
have received, and give unto them
who shall have more abundantly.

36 And it came to pass that I prayed
unto the Lord that he would give unto
the Gentiles “grace, that they might
have charity.

37 And it came to pass that the
Lord said unto me: If they have not
charity it mattereth not unto thee,
thou hast been faithful; wherefore,
thy garments shall be made “clean.
And because thou hast seen thy
b’weakness thou shalt be made strong,
even unto the sitting down in the
place which I have prepared in
the mansions of my Father.

38 And now I, Moroni, bid farewell
unto the Gentiles, yea, and also unto
my brethren whom I love, until we
shall meet before the *judgment-
seat of Christ, where all men shall
know that my °garments are not
spotted with your blood.

39 And then shall ye know that I
have “seen Jesus, and that he hath
talked with me °face to face, and
that he told me in ‘plain humility,
even as a man telleth another in
mine own language, concerning
these things;

40 And only a few have I written,
because of my weakness in writing.

41 And now, I would commend
you to “seek this Jesus of whom the

CHAPTER 13

Ether speaks of a New Jerusalem to
be built in America by the seed of Jo-
seph—He prophesies, is cast out, writes
the Jaredite history, and foretells the
destruction of the Jaredites—War rages
over all the land.

AND now I, Moroni, proceed to finish
my record concerning the destruc-
tion of the people of whom I have
been writing.

2 For behold, they rejected all the
words of Ether; for he truly told them
of all things, from the beginning of
man; and that after the waters had
“receded from off the face of this
bland it became a choice land above
all other lands, a chosen land of the
Lord; wherefore the Lord would
have that all men should ‘serve him
who dwell upon the face thereof;

3 And that it was the place of
the *7New Jerusalem, which should
b’come down out of heaven, and the
holy sanctuary of the Lord.

4 Behold, Ether saw the days of
Christ, and he spake concerning
a *New Jerusalem upon this land.

5 And he spake also concerning the
house of Israel, and the “Jerusalem
from whence Lehi should come—af-
ter it should be destroyed it should
be built up again, a ‘holy city unto
the Lord; wherefore, it could not be
a new Jerusalem for it had been in

 

512

atime of old; but it should be built
up again, and become a holy city of
the Lord; and it should be built unto
the house of Israel—

6 And that a “New Jerusalem should
be built up upon this land, unto the
remnant of the seed of °Joseph, for
which things there has been a ‘type.

7 For as Joseph brought his father
down into the land of “Egypt, even
so he died there; wherefore, the
Lord brought a remnant of the seed
of Joseph out of the land of Jeru-
salem, that he might be merciful
unto the seed of Joseph that they
should "perish not, even as he was
merciful unto the father of Joseph
that he should perish not.

8 Wherefore, the remnant of the
house of Joseph shall be built upon
this “land; and it shall be a land of
their inheritance; and they shall
build up a holy °city unto the Lord,
like unto the Jerusalem of old; and
they shall ‘no more be confounded,
until the end come when the earth
shall pass away.

9 And there shall be a“*new heaven
and a new earth; and they shall be
like unto the old save the old have
passed away, and all things have
become new.

10 And then cometh the New Je-
rusalem; and blessed are they who
dwell therein, for it is they whose
garments are *white through the
blood of the Lamb; and they are
they who are numbered among the
remnant of the seed of Joseph, who
were of the house of Israel.

11 And then also cometh the
“Jerusalem of old; and the inhabi-
tants thereof, blessed are they, for

they have been washed in the blood
of the Lamb; and they are they who
were scattered and gathered in from
the four quarters of the earth, and
from the "north countries, and are
partakers of the fulfilling of the
covenant which God made with
their father, ‘Abraham.

12 And when these things come,
bringeth to pass the scripture which
saith, there are they who were first,
who shall be last; and there are they
who were last, who shall be first.

13 And I was about to write more,
but I am forbidden; but great and
marvelous were the prophecies of
Ether; but they esteemed him as
naught, and cast him out; and he
*hid himself in the cavity of a rock
by day, and by night he went forth
viewing the things which should
come upon the people.

14 And as he dwelt in the cavity
of a rock he made the “remainder
of this record, viewing the destruc-
tions which came upon the people,
by night.

15 And it came to pass that in that
same year in which he was cast out
from among the people there began
to be a great war among the people,
for there were many who rose up,
who were mighty men, and sought
to destroy Coriantumr by their se-
cret plans of wickedness, of which
hath been spoken.

16 And now Coriantumr, having
studied, himself, in all the arts
of war and all the cunning of the
world, wherefore he gave battle unto
them who sought to destroy him.

17 But he repented not, neither his
“fair sons nor daughters; neither the
fair sons and daughters of Cohor;
neither the fair sons and daughters
of Corihor; and in fine, there were
none of the fair sons and daughters

 

ETHER 13:12-25

upon the face of the whole earth
who repented of their sins.

18 Wherefore, it came to pass that
in the first year that Ether dwelt
in the cavity of a rock, there were
many people who were slain by the
sword of those “secret combinations,
fighting against Coriantumr that
they might obtain the kingdom.

19 And it came to pass that the
sons of Coriantumr fought much
and bled much.

20 And in the second year the word
of the Lord came to Ether, that he
should go and “prophesy unto ’Cori-
antumr that, if he would repent,
and all his household, the Lord
would give unto him his kingdom
and spare the people—

21 Otherwise they should be
destroyed, and all his household
save it were himself. And he should
only live to see the fulfilling of the
prophecies which had been spoken
concerning “another people receiv-
ing the land for their inheritance;
and Coriantumr should receive
a burial by them; and every soul
should be destroyed save it were
’Coriantumr.

22 And it came to pass that Cori-
antumr repented not, neither his
household, neither the people; and
the wars ceased not; and they sought
to “kill Ether, but he fled from
before them and hid again in the
cavity of the rock.

23 And it came to pass that there
arose up Shared, and he also gave
battle unto Coriantumr; and he did
beat him, insomuch that in the third
year he did bring him into captivity.

24 And the sons of Coriantumr, in
the fourth year, did beat Shared,
and did obtain the kingdom again
unto their father.

25 Now there began to be a war

upon all the face of the land, “every
man with his band fighting for that
which he desired.

26 And there were robbers, and
in fine, all manner of wickedness
upon all the face of the land.

27 And it came to pass that Cori-
antumr was exceedingly angry with
Shared, and he went against him
with his armies to battle; and they
did meet in great anger, and they
did meet in the valley of Gilgal; and
the battle became exceedingly sore.

28 And it came to pass that Shared
fought against him for the space
of three days. And it came to pass
that Coriantumr beat him, and did
pursue him until he came to the
plains of Heshlon.

29 And it came to pass that Shared
gave him battle again upon the
plains; and behold, he did beat
Coriantumr, and drove him back
again to the valley of Gilgal.

30 And Coriantumr gave Shared
battle again in the valley of Gilgal, in
which he beat Shared and slew him.

31 And Shared wounded Corian-
tumr in his thigh, that he did not
go to battle again for the space of
two years, in which time all the
people upon the face of the land
were shedding blood, and there
was none to restrain them.

CHAPTER 14

The iniquity of the people brings a curse
upon the land—Coriantumr engages in
warfare against Gilead, then Lib, and
then Shiz—Blood and carnage cover
the land.

AND now there began to be a great
“curse upon all the land because of
the iniquity of the people, in which,
if a man should lay his tool or his
sword upon his shelf, or upon the
place whither he would keep it,
behold, upon the morrow, he could
not find it, so great was the curse
upon the land.

2 Wherefore every man did cleave

 

514

unto that which was his own, with
his hands, and would not borrow
neither would he lend; and every
man kept the hilt of his sword in
his right hand, in the “defence of
his property and his own life and
of his wives and children.

3 And now, after the space of two
years, and after the death of Shared,
behold, there arose the brother of
Shared and he gave battle unto
Coriantumr, in which Coriantumr
did beat him and did pursue him
to the wilderness of Akish.

4 And it came to pass that the
brother of Shared did give battle
unto him in the wilderness of Akish;
and the battle became exceedingly
sore, and many thousands fell by
the sword.

5 And it came to pass that Cori-
antumr did lay siege to the wilder-
ness; and the brother of Shared did
march forth out of the wilderness by
night, and slew a part of the army of
Coriantumr, as they were drunken.

6 And he came forth to the land
of “Moron, and placed himself upon
the throne of Coriantumr.

7 And it came to pass that Cori-
antumr dwelt with his army in the
wilderness for the space of two
years, in which he did receive great
strength to his army.

8 Now the brother of Shared, whose
name was Gilead, also received great
strength to his army, because of se-
cret combinations.

9 And it came to pass that his high
priest murdered him as he sat upon
his throne.

10 And it came to pass that one of
the secret combinations murdered
him in a secret pass, and obtained
unto himself the kingdom; and his
name was Lib; and Lib was a man of
great stature, more than any other
man among all the people.

11 And it came to pass that in the
first year of Lib, Coriantumr came
up unto the land of Moron, and
gave battle unto Lib.

12 And it came to pass that he
fought with Lib, in which Lib did
smite upon his arm that he was
wounded; nevertheless, the army
of Coriantumr did press forward
upon Lib, that he fled to the bor-
ders upon the seashore.

13 And it came to pass that Cori-
antumr pursued him; and Lib gave
battle unto him upon the seashore.

14 And it came to pass that Lib
did smite the army of Coriantumr,
that they fled again to the wilder-
ness of Akish.

15 And it came to pass that Lib did
pursue him until he came to the
plains of Agosh. And Coriantumr
had taken all the people with him
as he fled before Lib in that quarter
of the land whither he fled.

16 And when he had come to the
plains of Agosh he gave battle unto
Lib, and he smote upon him until
he died; nevertheless, the brother
of Lib did come against Coriantumr
in the stead thereof, and the battle
became exceedingly sore, in the
which Coriantumr fled again be-
fore the army of the brother of Lib.

17 Now the name of the brother
of Lib was called Shiz. And it came
to pass that Shiz pursued after
Coriantumr, and he did overthrow
many cities, and he did slay both
women and children, and he did
burn the cities.

18 And there went a fear of Shiz
throughout all the land; yea, a cry
went forth throughout the land—
Who can stand before the army of
Shiz? Behold, he sweepeth the earth
before him!

19 And it came to pass that the
people began to flock together in
armies, throughout all the face of
the land.

20 And they were divided; and a
part of them fled to the army of
Shiz, and a part of them fled to the
army of Coriantumr.

21 And so great and lasting had

 

ETHER 14:12-28

been the war, and so long had
been the scene of bloodshed and
carnage, that the whole face of the
land was covered with the “bodies
of the ’dead.

22 And so swift and speedy was
the war that there was none left to
bury the dead, but they did march
forth from the shedding of “blood
to the shedding of blood, leaving
the bodies of both men, women, and
children strewed upon the face of
the land, to become a prey to the
’worms of the flesh.

23 And the “scent thereof went
forth upon the face of the land,
even upon all the face of the land;
wherefore the people became trou-
bled by day and by night, because
of the scent thereof.

24 Nevertheless, Shiz did “not cease
to pursue Coriantumr; for he had
sworn to avenge himself upon Cori-
antumr of the blood of his brother,
who had been slain, and the word
of the Lord which came to Ether
that Coriantumr should not fall by
the sword.

25 And thus we see that the Lord
did visit them in the fulness of his
“wrath, and their wickedness and
abominations had prepared a way
for their everlasting destruction.

26 And it came to pass that Shiz
did pursue Coriantumr eastward,
even to the borders by the seashore,
and there he gave battle unto Shiz
for the space of three days.

27 And so terrible was the destruc-
tion among the armies of Shiz that
the people began to be frightened,
and began to flee before the armies
of Coriantumr; and they fled to the
land of Corihor, and swept off the
inhabitants before them, all them
that would not join them.

28 And they pitched their tents
in the valley of Corihor; and Cori-
antumr pitched his tents in the
valley of Shurr. Now the valley of
Shurr was near the hill Comnor;

wherefore, Coriantumr did gather
his armies together upon the hill
Comnor, and did sound a trumpet
unto the armies of Shiz to invite
them forth to battle.

29 And it came to pass that they
came forth, but were driven again;
and they came the second time, and
they were driven again the second
time. And it came to pass that they
came again the third time, and the
battle became exceedingly sore.

30 And it came to pass that Shiz
smote upon Coriantumr that he
gave him many deep wounds; and
Coriantumr, having lost his blood,
fainted, and was carried away as
though he were dead.

31 Now the loss of men, women
and children on both sides was so
great that Shiz commanded his peo-
ple that they should not pursue the
armies of Coriantumr; wherefore,
they returned to their camp.

CHAPTER 15

Millions of the Jaredites are slain in
battle—Shiz and Coriantumr assemble
all the people to mortal combat—The
Spirit of the Lord ceases to strive with
them—tThe Jaredite nation is utterly
destroyed—Only Coriantumr remains.

AND it came to pass when Corian-
tumr had recovered of his wounds,
he began to remember the “words
which Ether had spoken unto him.

2 He saw that there had been
slain by the sword already nearly
*two millions of his people, and he
began to sorrow in his heart; yea,
there had been slain two millions
of mighty men, and also their wives
and their children.

3 He began to repent of the evil
which he had done; he began to
remember the words which had
been spoken by the mouth of all
the prophets, and he saw them that
they were fulfilled thus far, every
whit; and his soul “mourned and
refused to be comforted.

 

516

4 And it came to pass that he wrote
an epistle unto Shiz, desiring him
that he would spare the people, and
he would give up the kingdom for
the sake of the lives of the people.

5 And it came to pass that when
Shiz had received his epistle he
wrote an epistle unto Coriantumr,
that if he would give himself up,
that he might slay him with his own
sword, that he would spare the lives
of the people.

6 And it came to pass that the
people repented not of their iniq-
uity; and the people of Coriantumr
were stirred up to anger against the
people of Shiz; and the people of
Shiz were stirred up to anger against
the people of Coriantumr; where-
fore, the people of Shiz did give bat-
tle unto the people of Coriantumr.

7 And when Coriantumr saw that
he was about to fall he fled again
before the people of Shiz.

8 And it came to pass that he came
to the waters of Ripliancum, which,
by interpretation, is large, or to
exceed all; wherefore, when they
came to these waters they pitched
their tents; and Shiz also pitched
his tents near unto them; and there-
fore on the morrow they did come
to battle.

9 And it came to pass that they
fought an exceedingly sore battle,
in which Coriantumr was wounded
again, and he fainted with the loss
of blood.

10 And it came to pass that the
armies of Coriantumr did press
upon the armies of Shiz that they
beat them, that they caused them
to flee before them; and they did
flee southward, and did pitch their
tents in a place which was called
Ogath.

11 And it came to pass that the
army of Coriantumr did pitch their
tents by the hill Ramah; and it was
that same hill where my father
Mormon did “hide up the records
unto the Lord, which were sacred.

12 And it came to pass that they
did gather together all the people
upon all the face of the land, who
had not been slain, save it was Ether.

13 And it came to pass that Ether
did “behold all the doings of the
people; and he beheld that the peo-
ple who were for Coriantumr were
gathered together to the army of
Coriantumr; and the people who
were for Shiz were gathered to-
gether to the army of Shiz.

14 Wherefore, they were for the
space of four years gathering to-
gether the people, that they might
get all who were upon the face of
the land, and that they might re-
ceive all the strength which it was
possible that they could receive.

15 And it came to pass that when
they were all gathered together, ev-
ery one to the army which he would,
with their wives and their children—
both men, women and children be-
ing armed with “weapons of war,
having shields, and ’breastplates,
and head-plates, and being clothed
after the manner of war—they did
march forth one against another to
battle; and they fought all that day,
and conquered not.

16 And it came to pass that when
it was night they were weary, and
retired to their camps; and after they
had retired to their camps they took
up a howling and a “lamentation for
the loss of the slain of their people;
and so great were their cries, their
howlings and lamentations, that
they did rend the air exceedingly.

17 And it came to pass that on the
morrow they did go again to bat-
tle, and great and terrible was that
day; nevertheless, they conquered
not, and when the night came again
they did rend the air with their
cries, and their howlings, and their
mournings, for the loss of the slain
of their people.

18 And it came to pass that Corian-

 

ETHER 15:12-28

tumr wrote again an epistle unto
Shiz, desiring that he would not
come again to battle, but that he
would take the kingdom, and spare
the lives of the people.

19 But behold, the “Spirit of the
Lord had ceased striving with them,
and °Satan had full power over
the ‘hearts of the people; for they
were given up unto the hardness
of their hearts, and the blindness of
their minds that they might be de-
stroyed; wherefore they went again
to battle.

20 And it came to pass that they
fought all that day, and when the
night came they slept upon their
swords.

21 And on the morrow they fought
even until the night came.

22 And when the night came they
were “drunken with anger, even asa
man who is drunken with wine; and
they slept again upon their swords.

23 And on the morrow they fought
again; and when the night came they
had all fallen by the sword save it
were fifty and two of the people of
Coriantumr, and sixty and nine of
the people of Shiz.

24 And it came to pass that they
slept upon their swords that night,
and on the morrow they fought
again, and they contended in their
might with their swords and with
their shields, all that day.

25 And when the night came there
were thirty and two of the people
of Shiz, and twenty and seven of
the people of Coriantumr.

26 And it came to pass that they
ate and slept, and prepared for
death on the morrow. And they
were large and mighty men as to
the strength of men.

27 And it came to pass that they
fought for the space of three hours,
and they fainted with the loss of
blood.

28 And it came to pass that when

the men of Coriantumr had received
sufficient strength that they could
walk, they were about to flee for
their lives; but behold, Shiz arose,
and also his men, and he swore in
his wrath that he would slay Cori-
antumr or he would perish by the
sword.

29 Wherefore, he did pursue them,
and on the morrow he did overtake
them; and they fought again with
the sword. And it came to pass that
when they had all fallen by the
sword, save it were Coriantumr and
Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with
the loss of blood.

30 And it came to pass that when
Coriantumr had leaned upon his
sword, that he rested a little, he
smote off the head of Shiz.

31 And it came to pass that after
he had smitten off the head of Shiz,

 

518

that Shiz raised up on his hands and
“fell; and after that he had strug-
gled for breath, he died.

32 And it came to pass that
*Coriantumr fell to the earth, and
became as if he had no life.

33 And the Lord spake unto Ether,
and said unto him: Go forth. And
he went forth, and beheld that the
words of the Lord had all been ful-
filled; and he “finished his ’record;
(and the “hundredth part I have
not written) and he hid them ina
manner that the people of Limhi
did find them.

34 Now the last words which are
written by “Ether are these: Whether
the Lord will that I be translated,
or that I suffer the will of the Lord
in the flesh, it mattereth not, if it
so be that I am ’saved in the king-
dom of God. Amen.

and because of their "hatred they
‘put to death every Nephite that
will not deny the Christ.

not to have written any more; but

THE words of Christ, which he spake
unto his “disciples, the twelve whom
he had chosen, as he laid his hands
upon them—

2 And he called them by name,
saying: Ye shall ¢call on the Father
in my name, in mighty prayer; and
after ye have done this ye shall have
’power that to him upon whom ye
shall lay your ‘hands, “ye shall give
the Holy Ghost; and in my name
shall ye give it, for thus do mine
apostles.

3 Now Christ spake these words
unto them at the time of his first
appearing; and the multitude heard
it not, but the disciples heard it;
and on as many as they “laid their
hands, fell the Holy Ghost.

CHAPTER 3

Elders ordain priests and teachers
by the laying on of hands. About
A.D. 401-21.

THE manner which the disciples,
who were called the “elders of
the church, ’ordained ‘priests and
teachers—

2 After they had prayed unto the
Father in the name of Christ, they
“Jaid their hands upon them, and
said:

3 In the name of Jesus Christ I
ordain you to be a priest (or if he
be a “teacher, I ordain you to be a
teacher) to preach repentance and
’remission of sins through Jesus
Christ, by the endurance of faith
on his name to the end. Amen.

4 And after this manner did they
“ordain priests and teachers, accord-
ing to the gifts and callings of God

 

MORONI 2:1-5:2

unto men; and they ordained them
by the ‘power of the Holy Ghost,
which was in them.

How elders and priests administer the

THE “manner of their elders and
priests administering the flesh and
blood of Christ unto the church;
and they administered it ‘accord-
ing to the commandments of Christ;
wherefore we know the manner to
be true; and the elder or priest did
minister it—

2 And they did kneel down with
the ¢church, and pray to the Father
in the name of Christ, saying:

3 O God, the Eternal Father, we
ask thee in the name of thy Son,
Jesus Christ, to bless and “sanctify
this "bread to the souls of all those
who partake of it; that they may
eat in ‘remembrance of the body
of thy Son, and witness unto thee,
O God, the Eternal Father, that
they are willing to take upon them
the ‘name of thy Son, and always
remember him, and keep his com-
mandments which he hath given
them, that they may always have
his “Spirit to be with them. Amen.

CHAPTER 6

Repentant persons are baptized and
fellowshipped—Church members who
repent are forgiven—Meetings are con-
ducted by the power of the Holy Ghost.
About A.D. 401-21.

AND now I speak concerning bap-
tism. Behold, elders, priests, and
teachers were baptized; and they
were not baptized save they brought
forth “fruit meet that they were
bworthy of it.

2 Neither did they receive any unto
baptism save they came forth witha
“broken "heart and a contrite spirit,
and witnessed unto the church
that they truly repented of all
their sins.

3 And none were received unto
baptism save they “took upon them
the name of Christ, having a deter-
mination to serve him to the end.

4 And after they had been received
unto baptism, and were wrought
upon and “cleansed by the power of
the Holy Ghost, they were numbered

520

among the people of the ’church
of Christ; and their ‘names were
taken, that they might be remem-
bered and nourished by the good
word of God, to keep them in the
right way, to keep them continu-
ally watchful unto prayer, ‘relying
alone upon the merits of Christ,
who was the author and the finisher
of their faith.

5 And the “church did meet to-
gether "oft, to ‘fast and to pray, and
to speak one with another concern-
ing the welfare of their souls.

6 And they did “meet together
oft to partake of bread and wine,
in "remembrance of the Lord
Jesus.

7 And they were strict to observe
that there should be “no iniquity
among them; and whoso was found
to commit iniquity, and ’three wit-
nesses of the church did condemn
them before the ‘elders, and if they
repented not, and “confessed not,
their names were “blotted out, and
they were not ‘numbered among
the people of Christ.

8 But 4as oft as they repented and
sought forgiveness, with real *intent,
they were ‘forgiven.

9 And their meetings were ¢con-
ducted by the church after the man-
ner of the workings of the Spirit,
and by the power of the Holy Ghost;
for as the power of the Holy Ghost
led them whether to preach, or to
exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate,
or to sing, even so it was done.

CHAPTER 7

An invitation is given to enter into
the rest of the Lord—Pray with real
intent—The Spirit of Christ enables
men to know good from evil—Satan
persuades men to deny Christ and do
evil—The prophets manifest the com-
ing of Christ—By faith, miracles are
wrought and angels minister—Men
should hope for eternal life and cleave
unto charity. About A.D. 401-21.

AND now I, Moroni, write a few of
the words of my father Mormon,
which he spake concerning “faith,
hope, and charity; for after this
manner did he speak unto the peo-
ple, as he taught them in the ’syna-
gogue which they had built for the
place of worship.

2 And now I, Mormon, speak unto
you, my beloved brethren; and it
is by the “grace of God the Father,
and our Lord Jesus Christ, and his
holy will, because of the gift of his
’calling unto me, that I am permit-
ted to speak unto you at this time.

3 Wherefore, I would speak unto
you that are of the “church, that are
the "peaceable followers of Christ,
and that have obtained a sufficient
‘hope by which ye can enter into
the “rest of the Lord, from this time
henceforth until ye shall rest with
him in heaven.

4 And now my brethren, I judge
these things of you because of your
peaceable “walk with the children
of men.

 

MORONI 7:1-12

5 For l remember the word of God
which saith by their “works ye shall
know them; for if their works be
good, then they are good also.

6 For behold, God hath said a man
being “evil cannot do that which is
good; for if he "offereth a gift, or
‘prayeth unto God, except he shall
do it with real “intent it profiteth
him nothing.

7 For behold, it is not counted unto
him for righteousness.

8 For behold, if a man being “evil
giveth a gift, he doeth it ’grudgingly;
wherefore it is counted unto him
the same as if he had retained the
gift; wherefore he is counted evil
before God.

9 And likewise also is it counted
evil unto a man, if he shall pray
and not with “real intent of heart;
yea, and it profiteth him nothing,
for God receiveth none such.

10 Wherefore, a man being evil
cannot do that which is good; nei-
ther will he give a good gift.

11 For behold, a bitter “fountain
cannot bring forth good water; nei-
ther can a good fountain bring forth
bitter water; wherefore, a man being
a servant of the devil cannot follow
Christ; and if he °follow Christ he
cannot be a ‘servant of the devil.

12 Wherefore, all things which
are “good cometh of God; and that
which is °evil cometh of the devil;
for the devil is an enemy unto God,
and fighteth against him continu-
ally, and inviteth and enticeth

to “sin, and to do that which is evil
continually.

13 But behold, that which is of God
inviteth and enticeth to do “good
continually; wherefore, every thing
which inviteth and ’enticeth to do
‘good, and to love God, and to serve
him, is “inspired of God.

14 Wherefore, take heed, my be-
loved brethren, that ye do not judge
that which is “evil to be of God,
or that which is good and of God to
be of the devil.

15 For behold, my brethren, it is
given unto you to “judge, that ye
may know good from evil; and the
way to judge is as plain, that ye may
know with a perfect knowledge, as
the daylight is from the dark night.

16 For behold, the *Spirit of Christ
is given to every °man, that he may
‘know good from evil; wherefore,
I show unto you the way to judge;
for every thing which inviteth to
do good, and to persuade to believe
in Christ, is sent forth by the power
and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may
know with a perfect knowledge it
is of God.

17 But whatsoever thing persuad-
eth men to do “evil, and believe not
in Christ, and deny him, and serve
not God, then ye may know with
a perfect knowledge it is of the
devil; for after this manner doth
the devil work, for he persuadeth
no man to do good, no, not one; nei-
ther do his angels; neither do they
who subject themselves unto him.

 

522

18 And now, my brethren, seeing
that ye know the “light by which
ye may judge, which light is the
light of Christ, see that ye do not
judge wrongfully; for with that
same *judgment which ye judge ye
shall also be judged.

19 Wherefore, I beseech of you,
brethren, that ye should search
diligently in the “light of Christ
that ye may know good from evil;
and if ye will lay hold upon every
good thing, and condemn it not, ye
certainly will be a *child of Christ.

20 And now, my brethren, how
is it possible that ye can lay hold
upon every good thing?

21 And now I come to that faith,
of which I said I would speak; and
I will tell you the way whereby ye
may lay hold on every good thing.

22 For behold, God “knowing all
things, being from "everlasting to
everlasting, behold, he sent ‘angels
to minister unto the children of
men, to make manifest concern-
ing the coming of Christ; and in
Christ there should come every
good thing.

23 And God also declared unto
prophets, by his own mouth, that
Christ should come.

24 And behold, there were divers
ways that he did manifest things
unto the children of men, which
were good; and all things which are
good cometh of Christ; otherwise
men were “fallen, and there could
no good thing come unto them.

25 Wherefore, by the ministering
of “angels, and by every word which
proceeded forth out of the mouth
of God, men began to exercise faith
in Christ; and thus by faith, they
did lay hold upon every good thing;
and thus it was until the coming
of Christ.

26 And after that he came men also
were “saved by faith in his name;
and by faith, they become the ’sons
of God. And as surely as Christ liv-
eth he spake these words unto our
fathers, saying: “Whatsoever thing
ye shall ask the Father in my name,
which is good, in faith believing that
ye shall receive, behold, it shall be
done unto you.

27 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, have “miracles ceased because
Christ hath ascended into heaven,
and hath sat down on the right hand
of God, to °claim of the Father his
rights of mercy which he hath upon
the children of men?

28 For he hath answered the ends
of the law, and he claimeth all those
who have faith in him; and they who
have faith in him will ¢cleave unto
every good thing; wherefore he ’ad-
vocateth the cause of the children
of men; and he dwelleth eternally
in the heavens.

29 And because he hath done this,
my beloved brethren, have mira-
cles ceased? Behold I say unto you,
Nay; neither have “angels ceased to
minister unto the children of men.

30 For behold, they are subject
unto him, to minister according to
the word of his command, showing
themselves unto them of strong

 

MORONI 7:25-36

faith and a firm mind in every form
of “godliness.

31 And the office of their minis-
try is to call men unto repentance,
and to fulfil and to do the work of
the covenants of the Father, which
he hath made unto the children of
men, to prepare the way among the
children of men, by declaring the
word of Christ unto the “chosen
vessels of the Lord, that they may
bear testimony of him.

32 And by so doing, the Lord God
prepareth the way that the “residue
of men may have °faith in Christ,
that the Holy Ghost may have place
in their hearts, according to the
power thereof; and after this man-
ner bringeth to pass the Father, the
covenants which he hath made unto
the children of men.

33 And Christ hath said: “If ye
will have faith in me ye shall have
power to do whatsoever thing is
“expedient in me.

34 And he hath said: “Repent all
ye ends of the earth, and come unto
me, and be baptized in my name,
and have faith in me, that ye may
be saved.

35 And now, my beloved brethren,
if this be the case that these things
are true which I have spoken unto
you, and God will show unto you,
with “power and great glory at the
last ’day, that they are true, and if
they are true has the day of mira-
cles ceased?

36 Or have angels ceased to appear
unto the children of men? Or has
he ¢withheld the power of the Holy
Ghost from them? Or will he, so

long as time shall last, or the earth
shall stand, or there shall be one man
upon the face thereof to be saved?

37 Behold I say unto you, Nay;
for it is by faith that “miracles are
wrought; and it is by faith that an-
gels appear and minister unto men;
wherefore, if these things have
ceased wo be unto the children of
men, for it is because of ’unbelief,
and all is vain.

38 For no man can be saved, ac-
cording to the words of Christ, save
they shall have faith in his name;
wherefore, if these things have
ceased, then has faith ceased also;
and awful is the state of man, for
they are as though there had been
no redemption made.

39 But behold, my beloved breth-
ren, I judge better things of you, for
I judge that ye have faith in Christ
because of your meekness; for if ye
have not faith in him then ye are
not “fit to be numbered among the
people of his church.

40 And again, my beloved brethren,
I would speak unto you concerning
“hope. How is it that ye can attain
unto faith, save ye shall have hope?

41 And what is it that ye shall
“hope for? Behold I say unto you
that ye shall have "hope through the
atonement of Christ and the power
of his resurrection, to be raised
unto life ‘eternal, and this because
of your faith in him according to
the promise.

42 Wherefore, if a man have “faith
he "must needs have hope; for with-
out faith there cannot be any hope.

 

524

43 And again, behold I say unto
you that he cannot have faith and
hope, save he shall be “meek, and
lowly of heart.

44 If so, his “faith and hope is vain,
for none is "acceptable before God,
save the ‘meek and lowly in heart;
and if aman be meek and lowly in
heart, and “confesses by the power
of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the
Christ, he must needs have char-
ity; for if he have not charity he is
nothing; wherefore he must needs
have charity.

45 And “charity suffereth long, and
is ’kind, and ‘envieth not, and is not
puffed up, seeketh not her own, is
not easily “provoked, thinketh no
evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity
but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth
all things, believeth all things, hop-
eth all things, endureth all things.

46 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, if ye have not charity, ye are
nothing, for charity never faileth.
Wherefore, cleave unto charity,
which is the greatest of all, for all
things must fail—

47 But “charity is the pure "love
of Christ, and it endureth ‘forever;
and whoso is found possessed of
it at the last day, it shall be well
with him.

48 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, “pray unto the Father with all
the energy of heart, that ye may be
filled with this love, which he hath
bestowed upon all who are true
’followers of his Son, Jesus Christ;
that ye may become the sons of
God; that when he shall appear we

CHAPTER 8

The baptism of little children is an
evil abomination—Little children are
alive in Christ because of the Atone-
ment—Faith, repentance, meekness and
lowliness of heart, receiving the Holy
Ghost, and enduring to the end lead to
salvation. About A.D. 401-21.

AN epistle of my “father Mormon,
written to me, Moroni; and it was
written unto me soon after my call-
ing to the ministry. And on this
wise did he write unto me, saying:

2 My beloved son, Moroni, I rejoice
exceedingly that your Lord Jesus
Christ hath been mindful of you,
and hath called you to his ministry,
and to his holy work.

31am mindful of you always in
my prayers, continually praying
unto God the Father in the name
of his Holy Child, Jesus, that he,
through his infinite “goodness and
berace, will keep you through the
endurance of faith on his name to
the end.

4 And now, my son, I speak unto
you concerning that which griev-
eth me exceedingly; for it grieveth
me that there should “disputations
rise among you.

5 For, if I have learned the truth,
there have been disputations among
you concerning the baptism of your
little children.

6 And now, my son, I desire that
ye should labor diligently, that this
gross error should be removed from

 

MORONI 8: 1-12

among you; for, for this intent I have
written this epistle.

7 For immediately after I had
learned these things of you I in-
quired of the Lord concerning the
matter. And the “word of the Lord
came to me by the power of the
Holy Ghost, saying:

8 “Listen to the words of Christ,
your Redeemer, your Lord and
your God. Behold, I came into the
world not to call the righteous but
sinners to repentance; the ’whole
need no physician, but they that are
sick; wherefore, little “children are
4whole, for they are not capable
of committing “sin; wherefore the
curse of ‘Adam is taken from them
in me, that it hath no power over
them; and the law of ¢circumcision
is done away in me.

9 And after this manner did the
Holy Ghost manifest the word of
God unto me; wherefore, my be-
loved son, I know that it is solemn
“mockery before God, that ye should
baptize little children.

10 Behold I say unto you that this
thing shall ye teach—repentance
and baptism unto those who are
“accountable and capable of com-
mitting sin; yea, teach parents that
they must repent and be baptized,
and humble themselves as their
little "children, and they shall all
be saved with their little children.

11 And their little “children need
no repentance, neither baptism. Be-
hold, baptism is unto repentance to
the fulfilling the commandments
unto the ’remission of sins,

12 But little *children are alive in
Christ, even from the foundation of
the world; if not so, God is a partial

God, and also a changeable God,
and a ’respecter to persons; for
how many little children have died
without baptism!

13 Wherefore, if little children
could not be saved without bap-
tism, these must have gone to an
endless hell.

14 Behold I say unto you, that he
that supposeth that little children
need baptism is in the gall of bitter-
ness and in the bonds of iniquity;
for he hath neither “faith, hope,
nor charity; wherefore, should he
be cut off while in the thought, he
must go down to hell.

15 For awful is the wickedness to
suppose that God saveth one child
because of baptism, and the other
must perish because he hath no
baptism.

16 Wo be unto them that shall
pervert the ways of the Lord after
this manner, for they shall perish
except they repent. Behold, I speak
with boldness, having ¢authority
from God; and I fear not what man
can do; for °perfect ‘love “casteth
out all fear.

17 And Lam filled with “charity,
which is everlasting love; where-
fore, all children are alike unto
me; wherefore, I love little children
witha perfect love; and they are all
alike and "partakers of salvation.

18 For I know that God is not a
partial God, neither a changeable
being; but he is “unchangeable from
all eternity to all eternity.

19 Little ¢children cannot repent;
wherefore, it is awful wickedness to
deny the pure mercies of God unto

 

526

them, for they are all alive in him
because of his ’mercy.

20 And he that saith that little
children need baptism denieth
the mercies of Christ, and setteth
at naught the “atonement of him
and the power of his redemption.

21 Wo unto such, for they are in
danger of death, “hell, and an "end-
less torment. I speak it boldly; God
hath commanded me, Listen unto
them and give heed, or they stand
against you at the ‘judgment-seat
of Christ.

22 For behold that all little chil-
dren are “alive in Christ, and also all
they that are without the "law. For
the power of ‘redemption cometh on
all them that have “no law; where-
fore, he that is not condemned, or
he that is under no condemnation,
cannot repent; and unto such bap-
tism availeth nothing—

23 But it is mockery before God,
denying the mercies of Christ, and
the power of his Holy Spirit, and
putting trust in “dead works.

24 Behold, my son, this thing
ought not to be; for “repentance is
unto them that are under condem-
nation and under the curse of a
broken law.

25 And the first fruits of “repen-
tance is "baptism; and baptism
cometh by faith unto the fulfilling
the commandments; and the fulfill-
ing the commandments bringeth
‘remission of sins;

26 And the remission of sins
bringeth “meekness, and lowliness
of heart; and because of meekness
and lowliness of heart cometh the

shall dwell with God.

27 Behold, my son, I will write
unto you again if I go not out soon
against the Lamanites. Behold, the
“pride of this nation, or the people
of the Nephites, hath proven their
destruction except they should
repent.

28 Pray for them, my son, that
repentance may come unto them.
But behold, I fear lest the Spirit
hath “ceased 'striving with them;
and in this part of the land they
are also seeking to put down all
power and authority which cometh
from God; and they are ‘denying
the Holy Ghost.

29 And after rejecting so great a
knowledge, my son, they must per-
ish soon, unto the fulfilling of the
prophecies which were spoken by
the prophets, as well as the words
of our Savior himself.

30 Farewell, my son, until I shall
write unto you, or shall meet you
again. Amen.

The second epistle of Mormon to
his son Moroni.

Comprising chapter 9.

CHAPTER 9

Both the Nephites and the Lamanites
are depraved and degenerate—They tor-
ture and murder each other—Mormon

 

MORONI 8:27-9:7

prays that grace and goodness may rest
upon Moroni forever. About A.D. 401.

My beloved son, I write unto you
again that ye may know that I am
yet alive; but I write somewhat of
that which is grievous.

2 For behold, I have had a sore bat-
tle with the Lamanites, in which we
did not conquer; and Archeantus has
fallen by the sword, and also Luram
and Emron; yea, and we have lost
a great number of our choice men.

3 And now behold, my son, I fear
lest the Lamanites shall destroy this
people; for they do not repent, and
Satan stirreth them up continually
to “anger one with another.

4 Behold, Lam laboring with them
continually; and when I speak the
word of God with “sharpness they
tremble and anger against me; and
when I use no sharpness they ’har-
den their hearts against it; where-
fore, I fear lest the Spirit of the Lord
hath ceased ‘striving with them.

5 For so exceedingly do they anger
that it seemeth me that they have
no fear of death; and they have lost
their love, one towards another; and
they “thirst after blood and revenge
continually.

6 And now, my beloved son, not-
withstanding their hardness, let us
labor “diligently; for if we should
cease to "labor, we should be brought
under condemnation; for we havea
labor to perform whilst in this taber-
nacle of clay, that we may conquer
the enemy of all righteousness, and
rest our souls in the kingdom of God.

7 And now I write somewhat con-
cerning the sufferings of this people.

MORONI 9:8-22

For according to the knowledge
which I have received from Amoron,
behold, the Lamanites have many
prisoners, which they took from the
tower of Sherrizah; and there were
men, women, and children.

8 And the husbands and fathers
of those women and children they
have slain; and they feed the women
upon the “flesh of their husbands,
and the children upon the flesh of
their fathers; and no water, save a
little, do they give unto them.

9 And notwithstanding this great
“abomination of the Lamanites, it
doth not exceed that of our people
in Moriantum. For behold, many of
the daughters of the Lamanites have
they taken prisoners; and after ’de-
priving them of that which was most
dear and precious above all things,
which is ‘chastity and “virtue—

10 And after they had done this
thing, they did murder them ina
most ¢cruel manner, torturing their
bodies even unto death; and after
they have done this, they devour
their flesh like unto wild beasts,
because of the hardness of their
hearts; and they do it for a token of
bravery.

11 O my beloved son, how cana
people like this, that are without
civilization—

12 (And only a few years have
passed away, and they were a civil
and a delightsome people)

13 But O my son, how can a peo-
ple like this, whose ¢delight is in
so much abomination—

14 How can we expect that God
will “stay his hand in judgment
against us?

15 Behold, my heart cries: Wo
unto this people. Come out in judg-
ment, O God, and hide their sins,
and wickedness, and abominations
from before thy face!

 

528

16 And again, my son, there are
many “widows and their daughters
who remain in Sherrizah; and that
part of the provisions which the
Lamanites did not carry away, be-
hold, the army of Zenephi has car-
ried away, and left them to wander
whithersoever they can for food;
and many old women do faint by
the way and die.

17 And the army which is with
me is weak; and the armies of the
Lamanites are betwixt Sherrizah
and me; and as many as have fled
to the army of “Aaron have fallen
victims to their awful brutality.

18 O the depravity of my peo-
ple! They are without “order and
without mercy. Behold, lam but a
man, and I have but the ’strength
of a man, and I cannot any longer
enforce my commands.

19 And they have become strong
in their perversion; and they are
alike brutal, sparing none, neither
old nor young; and they delight in
everything save that which is good;
and the suffering of our women and
our children upon all the face of
this land doth exceed everything;
yea, tongue cannot tell, neither can
it be written.

20 And now, my son, I dwell no
longer upon this horrible scene.
Behold, thou knowest the wicked-
ness of this people; thou knowest
that they are without principle,
and past feeling; and their wick-
edness doth “exceed that of the
Lamanites.

21 Behold, my son, I cannot rec-
ommend them unto God lest he
should smite me.

22 But behold, my son, I recom-
mend thee unto God, and I trust in
Christ that thou wilt be saved; and
I¢pray unto God that he will "spare
thy life, to witness the return of his

people unto him, or their utter de-
struction; for 1 know that they must
perish except they ‘repent and re-
turn unto him.

23 And if they perish it will be like
unto the “Jaredites, because of the
wilfulness of their hearts, "seeking
for blood and ‘revenge.

24 And if it so be that they perish,
we know that many of our brethren
have “deserted over unto the Laman-
ites,and many more will also desert
over unto them; wherefore, write
somewhat a few things, if thou art
spared and I shall perish and not
see thee; but I trust that I may see
thee soon; for I have sacred records
that I would ’deliver up unto thee.

25 My son, be faithful in Christ;
and may not the things which I have
written grieve thee, to weigh thee
down unto “death; but may Christ
lift thee up, and may his suffer-
ings and death, and the showing
his body unto our fathers, and his
mercy and "long-suffering, and the
hope of his glory and of eternal life,
rest in your ‘mind forever.

26 And may the grace of God the
Father, whose throne is high in the
heavens, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
who sitteth on the “right hand of
his power, until all things shall
become subject unto him, be, and
abide with you forever. Amen.

CHAPTER 10

A testimony of the Book of Mormon
comes by the power of the Holy Ghost—

 

MORONI 9:23-10:6

The gifts of the Spirit are dispensed to
the faithful—Spiritual gifts always ac-
company faith—Moroni’s words speak
from the dust—Come unto Christ, be
perfected in Him, and sanctify your
souls. About A.D. 421.

Now I, Moroni, write somewhat
as seemeth me good; and I write
unto my brethren, the *Lamanites;
and I would that they should know
that more than ’four hundred and
twenty years have passed away since
the sign was given of the coming
of Christ.

2 And I “seal up *these records,
after I have spoken a few words by
way of exhortation unto you.

3 Behold, I would exhort you that
when ye shall read these things, if
it be wisdom in God that ye should
read them, that ye would remember
how “merciful the Lord hath been
unto the children of men, from the
creation of Adam even down until
the time that ye shall receive these
things, and °ponder it in your ‘hearts.

4 And when ye shall receive these
things, I would exhort you that ye
would “ask God, the Eternal Father,
in the name of Christ, if these things
are not true; and if ye shall ask
with a ‘sincere heart, with ‘real in-
tent, having °‘faith in Christ, he will
fmanifest the ‘truth of it unto you,
by the power of the Holy Ghost.

5 And by the power of the Holy
Ghost ye may “know the "truth of
all things.

6 And whatsoever thing is good is

just and true; wherefore, nothing
that is good denieth the Christ, but
acknowledgeth that he is.

7 And ye may “know that he is, by
the power of the Holy Ghost; where-
fore I would exhort you that ye deny
not the power of God; for he worketh
by power, according to the faith
of the children of men, the same
today and tomorrow, and forever.

8 And again, I exhort you, my
brethren, that ye deny not the
“gifts of God, for they are many;
and they come from the same God.
And there are °different ways that
these gifts are administered; but it
is the same God who worketh allin
all; and they are given by the mani-
festations of the ‘Spirit of God unto
men, to profit them.

9 *For behold, to one is given by
the Spirit of God, that he may °teach
the word of wisdom;

10 And to another, that he may
“teach the word of "knowledge by
the same Spirit;

11 And to another, exceedingly
great “faith; and to another, the
gifts of *healing by the same Spirit;

12 And again, to another, that he
may work mighty “miracles;

13 And again, to another, that he
may prophesy concerning all things;

14 And again, to another, the be-
holding of angels and ministering
spirits;

15 And again, to another, all kinds
of tongues;

16 And again, to another, the in-
terpretation of “languages and of
divers kinds of tongues.

17 And all these gifts come by the

 

530

Spirit of Christ; and they come unto
every man severally, according as
he will.

18 And I would exhort you, my
beloved brethren, that ye remem-
ber that “every good 'gift cometh
of Christ.

19 And I would exhort you, my
beloved brethren, that ye remem-
ber that he is the “same yesterday,
today, and forever, and that all
these gifts of which I have spoken,
which are spiritual, never will be
done away, even as long as the world
shall stand, only according to the
bunbelief of the children of men.

20 Wherefore, there must be “faith;
and if there must be faith there must
also be hope; and if there must be
hope there must also be charity.

21 And except ye have “charity
ye can in nowise be saved in the
kingdom of God; neither can ye be
saved in the kingdom of God if ye
have not faith; neither can ye if
ye have no hope.

22 And if ye have no hope ye must
needs be in “despair; and despair
cometh because of iniquity.

23 And Christ truly said unto our
fathers: “If ye have faith ye can do
all things which are expedient unto
me.

24 And now I speak unto all the
ends of the earth—that if the day
cometh that the power and gifts of
God shall be done away among you,
it shall be “because of ‘unbelief.

25 And wo be unto the children
of men if this be the case; for there
shall be *none that doeth good
among you, no not one. For if there

he shall work by the power and

26 And wo unto them who shall
do these things away and die, for
they “die in their "sins, and they
cannot be saved in the kingdom
of God; and I speak it according to
the words of Christ; and I lie not.

27 And | exhort you to remember
these things; for the time speedily
cometh that ye shall know that I
lie not, for ye shall see me at the
bar of God; and the Lord God will
say unto you: Did I not declare my
*words unto you, which were writ-
ten by this man, like as one ’cry-
ing from the dead, yea, even as one
speaking out of the ‘dust?

28 I declare these things unto the
fulfilling of the prophecies. And
behold, they shall proceed forth
out of the mouth of the everlasting
God; and his word shall “hiss forth
from generation to generation.

29 And God shall show unto you,
that that which I have written is
“true.

30 And again I would exhort you
that ye would “come unto Christ,
and lay hold upon every good °gift,
and ‘touch not the evil gift, nor the
4unclean thing.

31 And “awake, and arise from the
dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on
thy beautiful garments, O daugh-

 

MORONI 10:26-34

ter of "Zion; and ‘strengthen thy
4stakes and enlarge thy borders for-
ever, that thou mayest ‘no more be
confounded, that the covenants of
the Eternal Father which he hath
made unto thee, O house of Israel,
may be fulfilled.

32 Yea, “come unto Christ, and be
>nerfected in him, and ‘deny your-
selves of all ungodliness; and if ye
shall deny yourselves of all ungod-
liness, and “love God with all your
might, mind and strength, then is
his grace sufficient for you, that
by his grace ye may be “perfect in
Christ; and if by the grace of God
ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in
nowise deny the power of God.

33 And again, if ye by the grace of
God are perfect in Christ, and deny
not his power, then are ye “sancti-
fied in Christ by the grace of God,
through the shedding of the blood
of Christ, which is in the covenant
of the Father unto the remission of
your ‘sins, that ye become “holy,
without spot.

34 And now I bid unto all, farewell.
I soon go to “rest in the "paradise
of God, until my ‘spirit and body
shall again “reunite, and I am
brought forth triumphant through
the air, to meet you before the /pleas-
ing bar of the great *Jehovah, the
Eternal "Judge of both quick and
dead. Amen.
