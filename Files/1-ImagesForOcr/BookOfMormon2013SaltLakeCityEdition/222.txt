face to face; and they did contend
mightily, one with another.

30 And it came to pass that Alma,
being a man of God, being exercised
with much “faith, cried, saying: O
Lord, have mercy and ’spare my
life, that I may be an instrument
in thy hands to save and preserve
this people.

31 Now when Alma had said these
words he contended again with
Amlici; and he was strengthened,
insomuch that he slew Amlici with
the sword.

32 And he also contended with the
king of the Lamanites; but the king
of the Lamanites fled back from
before Alma and sent his guards to
contend with Alma.

33 But Alma, with his guards, con-
tended with the guards of the king
of the Lamanites until he slew and
drove them back.

34 And thus he cleared the ground,
or rather the bank, which was on the
west of the river Sidon, throwing the
bodies of the Lamanites who had
been slain into the waters of Sidon,
that thereby his people might have
room to cross and contend with the
Lamanites and the Amlicites on the
west side of the river Sidon.

35 And it came to pass that when
they had all crossed the river Sidon
that the Lamanites and the Amlicites
began to flee before them, notwith-
standing they were so numerous
that they could not be numbered.

36 And they fled before the Neph-
ites towards the wilderness which
was west and north, away beyond
the borders of the land; and the
Nephites did pursue them with their
might, and did slay them.

37 Yea, they were met on every
hand, and slain and driven, until
they were scattered on the west, and
on the north, until they had reached
the wilderness, which was called
Hermounts; and it was that part of

 

the wilderness which was infested
by wild and ravenous beasts.

38 And it came to pass that many
died in the wilderness of their
wounds, and were devoured by those
beasts and also the vultures of the air;
and their bones have been found, and
have been heaped up on the earth.

CHAPTER 3

The Amiicites had marked themselves
according to the prophetic word—The
Lamanites had been cursed for their
rebellion—Men bring their own curses
upon themselves—The Nephites de-
feat another Lamanite army. About
87-86 B.c.

AND it came to pass that the Nephites
who were not “slain by the weapons
of war, after having buried those
who had been slain—now the num-
ber of the slain were not numbered,
because of the greatness of their
number—after they had finished
burying their dead they all returned
to their lands, and to their houses,
and their wives, and their children.

2 Now many women and children
had been slain with the sword, and
also many of their flocks and their
herds; and also many of their fields of
grain were destroyed, for they were
trodden down by the hosts of men.

3 And now as many of the Laman-
ites and the Amlicites who had been
slain upon the bank of the river Si-
don were cast into the ‘waters of
Sidon; and behold their bones are
in the depths of the *sea, and they
are many.

4 And the “Amlicites were distin-
guished from the Nephites, for they
had *marked themselves with red
in their foreheads after the manner
of the Lamanites; nevertheless they
had not shorn their heads like unto
the Lamanites.

5 Now the heads of the Lamanites
were shorn; and they were ‘naked,
