5 Now the reckoning is thus—a se-
nine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum
of gold, and a limnah of gold.

6 A senum of silver, an amnor of
silver, an ezrom of silver, and an
onti of silver.

7A senum of silver was equal
to a senine of gold, and either for
a measure of barley, and also fora
measure of every kind of grain.

8 Now the amount of a seon of
gold was twice the value of a senine.

9 And a shum of gold was twice
the value of a seon.

10 And a limnah of gold was the
value of them all.

11 And an amnor of silver was as
great as two senums.

12 And an ezrom of silver was as
great as four senums.

13 And an onti was as great as
them all.

14 Now this is the value of the
lesser numbers of their reckoning—

15 A shiblon is half of a senum;
therefore, a shiblon for half a mea-
sure of barley.

16 And a shiblum is a half of a
shiblon.

17 And a leah is the half of a
shiblum.

18 Now this is their number, ac-
cording to their reckoning.

19 Now an antion of gold is equal
to three shiblons.

20 Now, it was for the sole purpose
to get “gain, because they received
their wages according to their °em-
ploy, therefore, they did ‘stir up the
people to ¢riotings, and all manner
of disturbances and wickedness,
that they might have more em-
ploy, that they might ‘get /money
according to the suits which were
brought before them; therefore they
did stir up the people against Alma
and Amulek.

 

21 And this Zeezrom began to
question Amulek, saying: Will ye
answer mea few questions which I
shall ask you? Now Zeezrom was a
man who was “expert in the "devices
of the devil, that he might destroy
that which was good; therefore, he
said unto Amulek: Will ye answer
the questions which I shall put
unto you?

22 And Amulek said unto him:
Yea, if it be according to the “Spirit
of the Lord, which is in me; for I
shall say nothing which is con-
trary to the Spirit of the Lord. And
Zeezrom said unto him: Behold,
here are six onties of silver, and all
these will I ¢give thee if thou wilt
deny the existence of a Supreme
Being.

23 Now Amulek said: O thou “child
of hell, why *tempt ye me? Knowest
thou that the righteous yieldeth to
no such temptations?

24 Believest thou that there is
no God? I say unto you, Nay, thou
knowest that there is a God, but thou
lovest that “lucre more than him.

25 And now thou hast lied be-
fore God unto me. Thou saidst
unto me—Behold these six onties,
which are of great worth, I will
give unto thee—when thou hadst
it in thy heart to retain them from
me; and it was only thy desire that
I should deny the true and living
God, that thou mightest have cause
to destroy me. And now behold, for
this great evil thou shalt have thy
reward.

26 And Zeezrom said unto him:
Thou sayest there is a true and liv-
ing God?

27 And Amulek said: Yea, there is
a true and living God.

28 Now Zeezrom said: Is there more
than one God?
