the Lamanites did join the people
of Ammon, and did begin to labor
exceedingly, tilling the ground, rais-
ing all manner of grain, and flocks
and herds of every kind; and thus
were the Nephites relieved from a
great burden; yea, insomuch that
they were relieved from all the
prisoners of the Lamanites.

30 Now it came to pass that Moroni,
after he had obtained possession of
the city of Nephihah, having taken
many prisoners, which did reduce
the armies of the Lamanites exceed-
ingly, and having regained many of
the Nephites who had been taken
prisoners, which did strengthen the
army of Moroni exceedingly; there-
fore Moroni went forth from the land
of Nephihah to the land of Lehi.

31 And it came to pass that when
the Lamanites saw that Moroni was
coming against them, they were
again frightened and fled before
the army of Moroni.

32 And it came to pass that *Mo-
roniand his army did pursue them
from city to city, until they were
met by Lehi and Teancum; and the
Lamanites fled from Lehi and Tean-
cum, even down upon the borders
by the seashore, until they came to
the land of Moroni.

33 And the armies of the Laman-
ites were all gathered together, in-
somuch that they were all in one
body in the land of Moroni. Now
Ammoron, the king of the Laman-
ites, was also with them.

34 And it came to pass that Moroni
and Lehi and Teancum did encamp
with their armies round about in
the borders of the land of Moroni,
insomuch that the Lamanites were
encircled about in the borders by
the wilderness on the south, and
in the borders by the wilderness on
the east.

35 And thus they did encamp for
the night. For behold, the Neph-
ites and the Lamanites also were

 

weary because of the greatness of
the march; therefore they did not
resolve upon any stratagem in the
night-time, save it were Teancum;
for he was exceedingly angry with
Ammoron, insomuch that he con-
sidered that Ammoron, and Amal-
ickiah his brother, had been the
«cause of this great and lasting war
between them and the Lamanites,
which had been the cause of so much.
war and bloodshed, yea, and so
much famine.

36 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum in his anger did go forth into
the camp of the Lamanites, and did
let himself down over the walls of
the city. And he went forth with a
cord, from place to place, insomuch
that he did find the king; and he
did “cast a javelin at him, which
did pierce him near the heart. But
behold, the king did awaken his
servants before he died, insomuch
that they did pursue Teancum, and
slew him.

37 Now it came to pass that when
Lehi and Moroni knew that Tean-
cum was dead they were exceedingly
sorrowful; for behold, he had been
a man who had “fought valiantly
for his country, yea, a true friend
to liberty; and he had suffered very
many exceedingly sore afflictions.
But behold, he was dead, and had
gone the way of all the earth.

38 Now it came to pass that Mo-
roni marched forth on the morrow,
and came upon the Lamanites, inso-
much that they did slay them with
a great slaughter; and they did drive
them out of the land; and they did
flee, even that they did not return
at that time against the Nephites.

39 And thus ended the thirty and
first year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi; and thus
they had had wars, and bloodsheds,
and famine, and affliction, for the
space of many years.

40 And there had been murders,
