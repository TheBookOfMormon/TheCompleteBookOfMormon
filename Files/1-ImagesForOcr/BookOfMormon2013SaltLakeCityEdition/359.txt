little sons to a neighboring city, “as
if we were carrying provisions toa
neighboring city.

31 And we were to march near the
city of Antiparah, as if we were go-
ing to the city beyond, in the bor-
ders by the seashore.

32 And it came to pass that we did
march forth, as if with our provi-
sions, to go to that city.

33 And it came to pass that Anti-
pus did march forth with a part of
his army, leaving the remainder to
maintain the city. But he did not
march forth until I had gone forth
with my little army, and came near
the city Antiparah.

34 And now, in the city Antiparah
were stationed the strongest army
of the Lamanites; yea, the most
numerous.

35 And it came to pass that when
they had been informed by their
spies, they came forth with their
army and marched against us.

36 And it came to pass that we did
flee before them, northward. And
thus we did lead away the most
powerful army of the Lamanites;

37 Yea, even to a considerable dis-
tance, insomuch that when they
saw the army of Antipus pursuing
them, with their might, they did
not turn to the right nor to the
left, but pursued their march in a
straight course after us; and, as we
suppose, it was their intent to slay
us before Antipus should overtake
them, and this that they might not
be surrounded by our people.

38 And now Antipus, beholding
our danger, did speed the march of
his army. But behold, it was night;
therefore they did not overtake
us, neither did Antipus overtake
them; therefore we did camp for
the night.

39 And it came to pass that before
the dawn of the morning, behold,
the Lamanites were pursuing us.
Now we were not sufficiently strong

 

to contend with them; yea, I would
not suffer that my little sons should
fall into their hands; therefore we
did continue our march, and we
took our march into the wilderness.

40 Now they durst not turn to the
right nor to the left lest they should
be surrounded; neither would I turn
to the right nor to the left lest they
should overtake me, and we could
not stand against them, but be slain,
and they would make their escape;
and thus we did flee all that day
into the wilderness, even until it
was dark.

41 And it came to pass that again,
when the light of the morning came
we saw the Lamanites upon us, and
we did flee before them.

42 But it came to pass that they
did not pursue us far before they
halted; and it was in the morning of
the third day of the seventh month.

43 And now, whether they were
overtaken by Antipus we knew not,
but I said unto my men: Behold, we
know not but they have halted for
the purpose that we should come
against them, that they might catch
us in their snare;

44 Therefore what say ye, my sons,
will ye go against them to battle?

45 And now I say unto you, my
beloved brother Moroni, that never
had I seen “so great ’courage, nay,
not amongst all the Nephites.

46 For as I had ever called them
my sons (for they were all of them
very young) even so they said unto
me: Father, behold our God is with
us, and he will “not suffer that we
should fall; then let us go forth;
we would not slay our brethren if
they would let us alone; therefore
let us go, lest they should overpower
the army of Antipus.

47 Now they never had fought,
yet they did not fear death; and
they did think more upon the
“liberty of their fathers than they
did upon their lives; yea, they had
