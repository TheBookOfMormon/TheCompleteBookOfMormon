“pure, fair, and white, having been
cleansed by the blood of the ‘Lamb,
at that great and last day.

7 And again I speak unto you who
«deny the revelations of God, and say
that they are done away, that there
are no revelations, nor prophecies,
nor gifts, nor healing, nor speaking
with tongues, and the *interpreta-
tion of tongues;

8 Behold I say unto you, he that
denieth these things knoweth not
the “gospel of Christ; yea, he has not
read the scriptures; if so, he does
not *understand them.

9 For do we not read that God is the
“same ’yesterday, today, and forever,
and in him there is no ‘variableness
neither shadow of changing?

10 And now, if ye have imagined
up unto yourselves a god who doth
vary, and in whom there is shadow
of changing, then have ye imagined
up unto yourselves a god who is not
a God of miracles.

11 But behold, I will show unto you
a God of “miracles, even the God
of Abraham, and the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob; and it is that
same °God who created the heavens
and the earth, and all things that
in them are.

12 Behold, he created Adam, and
by “Adam came the fall of man.
And because of the fall of man came
Jesus Christ, even the Father and
the Son; and because of Jesus Christ
came the ‘redemption of man.

13 And because of the redemp-
tion of man, which came by Jesus
Christ, they are brought back into

 

the “presence of the Lord; yea, this
is wherein all men are redeemed,
because the death of Christ bringeth
to pass the *resurrection, which
bringeth to pass a redemption from
an endless ‘sleep, from which sleep
all men shall be awakened by the
power of God when the trump shall
sound; and they shall come forth,
both small and great, and all shall
stand before his bar, being re-
deemed and loosed from this eter-
nal “band of death, which death isa
temporal death.

14 And then cometh the “judgment
of the Holy One upon them; and
then cometh the time that he that
is *filthy shall be filthy still; and
he that is righteous shall be righ-
teous still; he that is happy shall be
happy still; and he that is unhappy
shall be unhappy still.

15 And now, O all ye that have
imagined up unto yourselves a god
who can do “no miracles, | would
ask of you, have all these things
passed, of which I have spoken? Has
the end come yet? Behold I say unto
you, Nay; and God has not ceased
to be a God of miracles.

16 Behold, are not the things that
God hath wrought marvelous in our
eyes? Yea, and who can comprehend
the marvelous “works of God?

17 Who shall say that it was not
a miracle that by his “word the
heaven and the earth should be; and
by the power of his word man was
’created of the ‘dust of the earth;
and by the power of his word have
miracles been wrought?
