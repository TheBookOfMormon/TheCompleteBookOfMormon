a “righteous judgment might come
upon them; and also if they are con-
demned they bring upon themselves
their own condemnation.

30 And now remember, remember,
my brethren, that whosoever perish-
eth, perisheth unto “himself; and
whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it
unto himself; for behold, ye are free;
ye are permitted to act for your-
selves; for behold, God hath given
unto you a “knowledge and he hath
made you free.

31 He hath given unto you that ye
might “know good from evil, and he
hath given unto you that ye might
’choose life or death; and ye can
do good and be ‘restored unto that
which is good, or have that which is
good restored unto you; or ye can
do evil, and have that which is evil
restored unto you.

CHAPTER 15

The Lord chastened the Nephites because
He loved them—Converted Lamanites
are firm and steadfast in the faith—The
Lord will be merciful unto the Lamanites
in the latter days. About 6 B.c.

AND now, my beloved brethren, be-
hold, I declare unto you that except
ye shall repent your houses shall
be left unto you “desolate.

2 Yea, except ye repent, your women
shall have great cause to mourn in
the day that they shall give suck; for
ye shall attempt to flee and there
shall be no place for “refuge; yea,
and wo unto them which are °with
child, for they shall be heavy and
cannot flee; therefore, they shall
be trodden down and shall be left
to perish.

3 Yea, wo unto this “people who

 

are called the people of Nephi ex-
cept they shall repent, when they
shall see all these signs and wonders
which shall be showed unto them;
for behold, they have been achosen
people of the Lord; yea, the people
of Nephi hath he loved, and also
hath he ‘chastened them; yea, in
the days of their iniquities hath he
chastened them because he loveth
them.

4 But behold my brethren, the
*Lamanites hath he hated because
their deeds have been evil continu-
ally, and this because of the iniquity
of the *tradition of their fathers.
But behold, salvation hath come
unto them through the preaching
of the Nephites; and for this in-
tent hath the Lord ‘prolonged their
days.

5 And I would that ye should be-
hold that the ‘more part of them
are in the path of their duty, and
they do walk circumspectly before
God, and they do observe to keep
his commandments and his statutes
and his judgments according to the
law of Moses.

6 Yea, I say unto you, that the more
part of them are doing this, and
they are striving with “unwearied
diligence that they may bring the
remainder of their brethren to the
knowledge of the truth; therefore
there are many who do add to their
numbers daily.

7 And behold, ye do know of your-
selves, for ye have witnessed it, that
as many of them as are brought to
the knowledge of the truth, and to
know of the wicked and abominable
traditions of their fathers, and are
led to believe the holy scriptures,
yea, the prophecies of the holy
prophets, which are written, which
