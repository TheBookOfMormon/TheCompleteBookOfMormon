prophets and stoned them not; and it
was they who had not shed the blood
of the saints, who were spared—

13 And they were spared and were
not sunk and buried up in the earth;
and they were not drowned in the
depths of the sea; and they were not
burned by fire, neither were they
fallen upon and crushed to death;
and they were not carried away in
the whirlwind; neither were they
overpowered by the vapor of smoke
and of darkness.

14 And now, whoso readeth, let him
understand; he that hath the scrip-
tures, let him “search them, and see
and behold if all these deaths and
destructions by fire, and by smoke,
and by *tempests, and by whirl-
winds, and by the ‘opening of the
earth to receive them, and all these
things are not unto the fulfilling
of the prophecies of many of the
holy prophets.

15 Behold, I say unto you, Yea,
many have testified of these things
at the coming of Christ, and were
“slain because they testified of these
things.

16 Yea, the prophet “Zenos did
testify of these things, and also
Zenock spake *concerning these
things, because they testified par-
ticularly concerning us, who are the
remnant of their seed.

17 Behold, our father Jacob also
testified concerning a “remnant of
the seed of Joseph. And behold, are
not we a remnant of the seed of
Joseph? And these things which tes-
tify of us, are they not written upon
the plates of brass which our father
Lehi brought out of Jerusalem?

18 And it came to pass that in the
ending of the thirty and fourth year,
behold, I will show unto you that the
people of Nephi who were spared,
and also those who had been called

 

«Lamanites, who had been spared,
did have great favors shown unto
them, and great blessings poured
out upon their heads, insomuch that
soon after the ‘ascension of Christ
into heaven he did truly manifest
himself unto them—

19 *Showing his body unto them,
and ministering unto them; and
an account of his ministry shall be
given hereafter. Therefore for this
time I make an end of my sayings.

Jesus Christ did show himself unto
the people of Nephi, as the multi-
tude were gathered together in the
land Bountiful, and did minister
unto them; and on this wise did he
show himself unto them.

Comprising chapters 11 through 26.

CHAPTER 11

The Father testifies of His Beloved
Son—Christ appears and proclaims
His Atonement—The people feel the
wound marks in His hands and feet
and side—They cry Hosanna—He sets
forth the mode and manner of baptism
—The spirit of contention is of the
devil—Christ’s doctrine is that men
should believe and be baptized and re-
ceive the Holy Ghost. About A.D. 34.

AND now it came to pass that there
were a great multitude “gathered
together, of the people of Nephi,
round about the temple which was
in the land *Bountiful; and they
were marveling and wondering one
with another, and were showing one
to another the ‘great and marvel-
ous change which had taken place.

2 And they were also conversing
about this Jesus Christ, of whom
the ¢sign had been given concern-
ing his death.
