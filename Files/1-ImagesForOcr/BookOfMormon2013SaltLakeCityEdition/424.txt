siege sufficiently long to have any
effect upon the Nephites, because
of their ¢much ’provision which
they had laid up in store,

19 And because of the scantiness
of provisions among the robbers;
for behold, they had nothing save
it were meat for their subsistence,
which meat they did obtain in the
wilderness;

20 And it came to pass that the
“wild game became scarce in the wil-
derness insomuch that the robbers
were about to perish with hunger.

21 And the Nephites were continu-
ally marching out by day and by
night, and falling upon their armies,
and cutting them off by thousands
and by tens of thousands.

22 And thus it became the desire of
the people of Zemnarihah to with-
draw from their design, because of
the great destruction which came
upon them by night and by day.

23 And it came to pass that Zem-
narihah did give command unto his
people that they should withdraw
themselves from the siege, and
march into the furthermost parts
of the land northward.

24 And now, Gidgiddoni being
aware of their design, and knowing
of their weakness because of the
want of food, and the great slaugh-
ter which had been made among
them, therefore he did send out his
armies in the night-time, and did
cut off the way of their retreat, and
did place his armies in the way of
their retreat.

25 And this did they do in the
night-time, and got on their march
beyond the robbers, so that on the
morrow, when the robbers began
their march, they were met by the
armies of the Nephites both in their
front and in their rear.

26 And the robbers who were on
the south were also cut off in their

 

places of retreat. And all these
things were done by command of
Gidgiddoni.

27 And there were many thou-
sands who did yield themselves up
prisoners unto the Nephites, and
the remainder of them were slain.

28 And their leader, Zemnarihah,
was taken and hanged upon a tree,
yea, even upon the top thereof un-
til he was dead. And when they
had hanged him until he was dead
they did fell the tree to the earth,
and did cry with a loud voice,
saying:

29 May the Lord preserve his peo-
ple in righteousness and in holiness
of heart, that they may cause to be
felled to the earth all who shall seek
to slay them because of power and
secret combinations, even as this
man hath been felled to the earth.

30 And they did rejoice and cry
again with one voice, saying: May
the “God of Abraham, and the God
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, pro-
tect this people in righteousness, so
long as they shall ’call on the name
of their God for ‘protection.

31 And it came to pass that they
did break forth, all as one, in sing-
ing, and “praising their God for
the great thing which he had done
for them, in preserving them from
falling into the hands of their
enemies.

32 Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to
the Most High God. And they did
cry: Blessed be the name of the Lord
God “Almighty, the Most High God.

33 And their hearts were swollen.
with joy, unto the gushing out of
many tears, because of the great
goodness of God in delivering them
out of the hands of their enemies;
and they knew it was because of
their repentance and their humility
that they had been delivered from
an everlasting destruction.
