had supposed, because of the great-
ness of their numbers, yea, they
supposed that they should be privi-
leged to come upon them as they
had hitherto done; yea, and they had
also prepared themselves with
shields, and with “breastplates;
and they had also prepared them-
selves with garments of skins, yea,
very thick garments to cover their
nakedness.

7 And being thus prepared they
supposed that they should easily
overpower and “subject their breth-
ren to the yoke of bondage, or slay
and massacre them according to
their pleasure.

8 But behold, to their uttermost
astonishment, they were “prepared
for them, in a manner which never
had been known among the chil-
dren of Lehi. Now they were pre-
pared for the Lamanites, to battle
after the manner of the instructions
of Moroni.

9 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites, or the Amalickiahites,
were exceedingly astonished at
their manner of preparation for
war.

10 Now, if king Amalickiah had
come down out of the “land of Nephi,
at the head of his army, perhaps
he would have caused the Laman-
ites to have attacked the Nephites
at the city of Ammonihah; for be-
hold, he did care not for the blood
of his people.

11 But behold, Amalickiah did not
come down himself to battle. And
behold, his chief captains durst
not attack the Nephites at the city
of Ammonihah, for Moroni had
altered the management of affairs
among the Nephites, insomuch that
the Lamanites were disappointed
in their places of retreat and they
could not come upon them.

12 Therefore they retreated into
the wilderness, and took their camp

 

and marched towards the land of
“Noah, supposing that to be the
next best place for them to come
against the Nephites.

13 For they knew not that Moroni
had fortified, or had built “forts
of security, for every city in all the
land round about; therefore, they
marched forward to the land of
Noah with a firm determination;
yea, their chief captains came for-
ward and took an oath that they
would destroy the people of that
city.

14 But behold, to their astonish-
ment, the city of Noah, which had
hitherto been a weak place, had
now, by the means of Moroni, be-
come strong, yea, even to exceed the
strength of the city Ammonihah.

15 And now, behold, this was wis-
dom in Moroni; for he had supposed
that they would be frightened at
the city Ammonihah; and as the
city of Noah had hitherto been the
weakest part of the land, therefore
they would march thither to bat-
tle; and thus it was according to
his desires.

16 And behold, Moroni had ap-
pointed Lehi to be chief captain
over the men of that city; and it was
that ‘same Lehi who fought with
the Lamanites in the valley on the
east of the river Sidon.

17 And now behold it came to
pass, that when the Lamanites had
found that Lehi commanded the
city they were again disappointed,
for they feared Lehi exceedingly;
nevertheless their chief captains
had “sworn with an oath to attack
the city; therefore, they brought up
their armies.

18 Now behold, the Lamanites
could not get into their forts of
security by any other way save by
the entrance, because of the high-
ness of the bank which had been
thrown up, and the depth of the
