again the second time to “restore his
people from their lost and fallen
state. Wherefore, he will proceed to
doa *marvelous work and a wonder
among the children of men.

18 Wherefore, he shall bring forth
“his words unto them, which words
shall ‘judge them at the last day,
for they shall be given them for
the purpose of “convincing them of
the true Messiah, who was rejected
by them; and unto the convincing
of them that they need not look
forward any more for a Messiah
to come, for there should not any
come, save it should be a ‘false
Messiah which should deceive
the people; for there is save one
‘Messiah spoken of by the prophets,
