17 But it came to pass that on the
morrow they did return. And now
behold, we did not “inquire of them
concerning the prisoners; for be-
hold, the Lamanites were upon us,
and they returned in season to save
us from falling into their hands.
For behold, Ammoron had sent to
their support a new supply of pro-
visions and also a numerous army
of men.

18 And it came to pass that those
men whom we sent with the pris-
oners did arrive in season to check
them, as they were about to over-
power us.

19 But behold, my little band of
two thousand and sixty fought most
desperately; yea, they were firm
before the Lamanites, and did ¢ad-
minister death unto all those who
opposed them.

20 And as the remainder of our
army were about to give way be-
fore the Lamanites, behold, those
two thousand and sixty were firm
and undaunted.

21 Yea, and they did “obey and
observe to perform every word
of command with exactness; yea,
and even according to their faith it
was done unto them; and I did re-
member the words which they said
unto me that their "mothers had
taught them.

22 And now behold, it was these
my sons, and those men who had
been selected to convey the prison-
ers, to whom we owe this great vic-
tory; for it was they who did beat
the Lamanites; therefore they were
driven back to the city of Manti.

23 And we retained our city Cu-
meni, and were not all destroyed
by the sword; nevertheless, we had
suffered great loss.

24 And it came to pass that after
the Lamanites had fled, I imme-
diately gave orders that my men
who had been wounded should be

 

taken from among the dead, and
caused that their wounds should
be dressed.

25 And it came to pass that there
were two hundred, out of my two
thousand and sixty, who had fainted
because of the loss of blood; never-
theless, according to the goodness of
God, and to our great astonishment,
and also the joy of our whole army,
there was “not one soul of them who
did perish; yea, and neither was
there one soul among them who
had not received many wounds.

26 And now, their “preservation
was astonishing to our whole army,
yea, that they should be spared
while there was a thousand of our
brethren who were slain. And we
do justly ascribe it to the miracu-
lous *power of God, because of their
exceeding ‘faith in that which they
had been taught to believe—that
there was a just God, and whoso-
ever did not doubt, that they should
be preserved by his marvelous
power.

27 Now this was the “faith of these
of whom I have spoken; they are
young, and their minds are °firm,
and they do put their trust in God
continually.

28 And now it came to pass that
after we had thus taken care of our
wounded men, and had buried our
dead and also the dead of the La-
manites, who were many, behold,
we did inquire of Gid concern-
ing the “prisoners whom they had
started to go down to the land of
Zarahemla with.

29 Now Gid was the chief captain
over the band who was appointed
to guard them down to the land.

30 And now, these are the words
which Gid said unto me: Behold,
we did start to go down to the land
of Zarahemla with our prisoners.
And it came to pass that we did
meet the spies of our armies, who
