39 And the king of the Lamanites
had granted unto Amulon that he
should be a king and a ruler over
his people, who were in the land
of Helam; nevertheless he should
have no power to do anything con-
trary to the will of the king of the
Lamanites.

CHAPTER 24

Amulon persecutes Alma and his peo-
ple—They are to be put to death if they
pray—The Lord makes their burdens
seem light—He delivers them from
bondage, and they return to Zarahemla.
About 145-120 B.c.

AND it came to pass that Amulon
did gain favor in the eyes of the
king of the Lamanites; therefore,
the king of the Lamanites granted
unto him and his brethren that they
should be appointed teachers over
his people, yea, even over the people
who were in the land of Shemlon,
and in the land of Shilom, and in
the “land of Amulon.

2 For the Lamanites had taken pos-
session of all these lands; therefore,
the king of the Lamanites had ap-
pointed kings over all these lands.

3 And now the name of the king
of the Lamanites was “Laman, be-
ing called after the name of his
father; and therefore he was called
king Laman. And he was king over
a numerous people.

4 And he appointed “teachers of
the "brethren of Amulon in every
land which was possessed by his
people; and thus the ‘language of
Nephi began to be taught among all
the people of the Lamanites.

5 And they were a people friendly
one with another; nevertheless
they knew not God; neither did the
brethren of Amulon teach them
anything concerning the Lord their

 

God, neither the law of Moses; nor
did they teach them the words of
Abinadi;

6 But they taught them that they
should keep their record, and that
they might write one to another.

7 And thus the Lamanites began
to increase in riches, and began to
“trade one with another and wax
great, and began to be a cunning
and a wise people, as to the wisdom
of the world, yea, a very cunning
people, delighting in all manner of
wickedness and plunder, except it
were among their own brethren.

8 And now it came to pass that
4¢Amulon began to exercise "author-
ity over Alma and his brethren, and
began to persecute him, and cause
that his children should persecute
their children.

9 For Amulon knew Alma, that he
had been “one of the king’s priests,
and that it was he that believed the
words of Abinadi and was driven
out before the king, and therefore
he was wroth with him; for he was
subject to king Laman, yet he exer-
cised authority over them, and put
*tasks upon them, and put ‘task-
masters over them.

10 And it came to pass that so great
were their afflictions that they be-
gan to cry mightily to God.

11 And Amulon commanded them
that they should stop their cries; and
he “put guards over them to watch
them, that whosoever should be
found calling upon God should
be put to death.

12 And Alma and his people did
not raise their voices to the Lord
their God, but did pour out their
“hearts to him; and he did know the
*thoughts of their hearts.

13 And it came to pass that the
voice of the Lord came to them in
their afflictions, saying: Lift up
