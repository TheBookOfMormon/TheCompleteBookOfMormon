affliction, and providing food for
their armies.

8 And now it came to pass that
the armies of the Lamanites, on the
west sea, south, while in the absence
of Moroni on account of some in-
trigue amongst the Nephites, which
caused ‘dissensions amongst them,
had gained some ground over the
Nephites, yea, insomuch that they
had obtained possession of a num-
ber of their cities in that part of
the land.

9 And thus because of “iniquity
amongst themselves, yea, because
of dissensions and intrigue among
themselves they were placed in the
most dangerous circumstances.

10 And now behold, I have some-
what to say concerning the “people
of Ammon, who, in the beginning,
were Lamanites; but by Ammon
and his brethren, or rather by the
power and word of God, they had
been *converted unto the Lord; and
they had been brought down into
the land of Zarahemla, and had
ever since been protected by the
Nephites.

11 And because of their oath they
had been kept from taking up arms
against their brethren; for they had
taken an oath that they ‘never would
shed blood more; and according
to their oath they would have per-
ished; yea, they would have suffered
themselves to have fallen into the
hands of their brethren, had it not
been for the pity and the exceeding
love which Ammon and his breth-
ren had had for them.

12 And for this cause they were
brought down into the land of
Zarahemla; and they ever had been
“protected by the Nephites.

13 But it came to pass that when
they saw the danger, and the many
afflictions and tribulations which
the Nephites bore for them, they

 

were moved with compassion and
were ‘desirous to take up arms in
the defence of their country.

14 But behold, as they were about
to take their weapons of war, they
were overpowered by the persua-
sions of Helaman and his brethren,
for they were about to “break the
*’oath which they had made.

15 And Helaman feared lest by
so doing they should lose their
souls; therefore all those who had
entered into this covenant were
compelled to behold their brethren
wade through their afflictions, in
their dangerous circumstances at
this time.

16 But behold, it came to pass
they had many “sons, who had not
entered into a covenant that they
would not take their weapons of
war to defend themselves against
their enemies; therefore they did
assemble themselves together at this
time, as many as were able to take
up arms, and they called themselves
Nephites.

17 And they entered into a cov-
enant to fight for the liberty of the
Nephites, yea, to protect the land
unto the “laying down of their lives;
yea, even they covenanted that they
never would give up their “liberty,
but they would fight in all cases to
protect the Nephites and themselves
from bondage.

18 Now behold, there were two
thousand of those young men, who
entered into this covenant and took
their weapons of war to defend
their country.

19 And now behold, as they never
had hitherto been a disadvantage
to the Nephites, they became now
at this period of time also a great
support; for they took their weap-
ons of war, and they would that
Helaman should be their leader.

20 And they were all young men,
