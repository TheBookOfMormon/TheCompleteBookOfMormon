the governor, was a just man, and
could not be frightened by the
demands and the threatenings of
a ‘robber; therefore he did not
hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi,
the governor of the robbers, but he
did cause that his people should cry
unto the Lord for *strength against
the time that the robbers should
come down against them.

13 Yea, he sent a proclamation
among all the people, that they
should “gather together their women,
and their children, their flocks and
their herds, and all their substance,
save it were their land, unto one place.

14 And he caused that “fortifica-
tions should be built round about
them, and the strength thereof
should be exceedingly great. And
he caused that armies, both of the
Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of
all them who were numbered among
the Nephites, should be placed as
guards round about to watch them,
and to guard them from the robbers
day and night.

15 Yea, he said unto them: As the
Lord liveth, except ye repent of all
your iniquities, and cry unto the
Lord, ye will in nowise be “delivered
out of the hands of those Gadianton
robbers.

16 And so great and marvelous
were the words and prophecies of
Lachoneus that they did cause fear
to come upon all the people; and
they did exert themselves in their
might to do according to the words
of Lachoneus.

17 And it came to pass that La-
choneus did appoint chief captains
over all the armies of the Nephites,
to command them at the time that
the robbers should come down out
of the wilderness against them.

18 Now the chiefest among all the

 

chief captains and the great com-
mander of all the armies of the
Nephites was appointed, and his
name was “Gidgiddoni.

19 Now it was the custom among
all the Nephites to appoint for their
chief captains, (save it were in their
times of wickedness) some one that
had the “spirit of revelation and
also prophecy; therefore, this Gid-
giddoni was a great prophet among
them, as also was the chief judge.

20 Now the people said unto Gid-
giddoni: “Pray unto the Lord, and let
us go up upon the mountains and
into the wilderness, that we may
fall upon the robbers and destroy
them in their own lands.

21 But Gidgiddoni saith unto them:
The Lord “forbid; for if we should
go up against them the Lord would
’deliver us into their hands; there-
fore we will prepare ourselves in
the center of our lands, and we will
gather all our armies together, and
we will not go against them, but we
will wait till they shall come against
us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if
we do this he will deliver them into
our hands.

22 And it came to pass in the sev-
enteenth year, in the latter end of
the year, the proclamation of La-
choneus had gone forth throughout
all the face of the land, and they
had taken their “horses, and their
chariots, and their cattle, and all
their flocks, and their herds, and
their grain, and all their substance,
and did march forth by thousands
and by tens of thousands, until they
had all gone forth to the *place
which ‘had been appointed that
they should gather themselves to-
gether, to defend themselves against
their enemies.

23 And the ‘land which was
