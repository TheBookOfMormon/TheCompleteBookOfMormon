’priestcraft to be enforced among
this people it would prove their
entire destruction.

13 And thou hast shed the “blood
of a righteous man, yea, a man who
has done much good among this
people; and were we to spare thee
his blood would come upon us for
bvengeance.

14 Therefore thou art condemned
to “die, according to the “law which
has been given us by Mosiah, our
last king; and it has been ‘acknowl-
edged by this people; therefore this
people must “abide by the law.

15 And it came to pass that they
took him; and his name was “Nehor;
and they carried him upon the top
of the hill Manti, and there he was
caused, or rather did acknowledge,
between the heavens and the earth,
that what he had taught to the peo-
ple was contrary to the word of God;
and there he suffered an ignomini-
ous *death.

16 Nevertheless, this did not put an
end to the spreading of priestcraft
through the land; for there were
many who loved the vain things
of the world, and they went forth
preaching “false doctrines; and
this they did for the sake of *riches
and honor.

17 Nevertheless, they durst not
“lie, if it were known, for fear of
the law, for liars were punished;
therefore they pretended to preach
according to their belief; and now
the law could have no power on
any man for his belief.

18 And they durst not ¢steal, for
fear of the law, for such were pun-

murder, for he that *murdered was
punished unto ‘death.

19 But it came to pass that whoso-
ever did not belong to the church
of God began to persecute those
that did belong to the church of
God, and had taken upon them the
name of Christ.

20 Yea, they did persecute them,
and afflict them with all manner
of words, and this because of their
humility; because they were not
proud in their own eyes, and be-
cause they did impart the word
of God, one with another, without
«money and without price.

21 Now there was a strict law
among the people of the church, that
there should “not any man, belong-
ing to the church, arise and perse-
cute those that did not belong to the
church, and that there should be
no persecution among themselves.

22 Nevertheless, there were many
among them who began to be proud,
and began to contend warmly with
their adversaries, even unto blows;
yea, they would smite one another
with their “fists.

23 Now this was in the second year
of the reign of Alma, and it was a
cause of much affliction to the
church; yea, it was the cause of much
trial with the church.

24 For the hearts of many were
hardened, and their names were
“blotted out, that they were remem-
bered no more among the people
of God. And also many *withdrew
themselves from among them.

25 Now this was a great trial to
those that did stand fast in the faith;
