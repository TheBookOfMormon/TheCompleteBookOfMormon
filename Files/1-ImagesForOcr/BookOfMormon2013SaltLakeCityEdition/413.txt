leadeth them to faith on the Lord,
and unto repentance, which faith
and repentance bringeth a ‘change
of heart unto them—

8 Therefore, as many as have come
to this, ye know of yourselves are
“firm and steadfast in the faith, and
in the thing wherewith they have
been made free.

9 And ye know also that they have
“buried their weapons of war, and
they fear to take them up lest by
any means they should sin; yea, ye
can see that they fear to sin—for
behold they will suffer themselves
that they be trodden down and slain
by their enemies, and will not lift
their swords against them, and this
because of their *faith in Christ.

10 And now, because of their
“steadfastness when they do believe
in that thing which they do believe,
for because of their firmness when
they are once enlightened, behold,
the Lord shall bless them and pro-
long their days, notwithstanding
their iniquity—

11 Yea, even if they should dwindle
in unbelief the Lord shall “prolong
their days, until the time shall come
which hath been spoken of by our
fathers, and also by the prophet
*Zenos, and many other prophets,
concerning the ‘restoration of our
brethren, the Lamanites, again to
the knowledge of the truth—

12 Yea, I say unto you, that in the
latter times the “promises of the
Lord have been extended to our
brethren, the Lamanites; and not-
withstanding the many afflictions
which they shall have, and notwith-
standing they shall be °driven to
and fro upon the face of the earth,
and be hunted, and shall be smit-
ten and scattered abroad, having no

 

place for ‘refuge, the Lord shall be
“merciful unto them.

13 And this is according to the
prophecy, that they shall again be
“brought to the true knowledge,
which is the knowledge of their
Redeemer, and their great and true
’shepherd, and be numbered among
his ‘sheep.

14 Therefore I say unto you, it
shall be “better for them than for
you except ye repent.

15 For behold, “had the mighty
works been shown unto them which
have been shown unto you, yea,
unto them who have dwindled in
unbelief because of the traditions
of their fathers, ye can see of your-
selves that they never would again
have dwindled in unbelief.

16 Therefore, saith the Lord: I will
not utterly destroy them, but I
will cause that in the day of my
wisdom they shall “return again
unto me, saith the Lord.

17 And now behold, saith the
Lord, concerning the people of the
Nephites: If they will not repent,
and observe to do my will, I will ut-
terly “destroy them, saith the Lord,
because of their unbelief notwith-
standing the many mighty works
which I have done among them;
and as surely as the Lord liveth
shall these things be, saith the Lord.

CHAPTER 16

The Nephites who believe Samuel are
baptized by Nephi—Samuel cannot be
slain with the arrows and stones of the
unrepentant Nephites—Some harden
their hearts, and others see angels—The
unbelievers say it is not reasonable to
believe in Christ and His coming in
Jerusalem. About 6-1 B.C.
