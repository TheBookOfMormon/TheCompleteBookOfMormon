that man should be reclaimed from
this “temporal death, for that would
destroy the great "plan of happiness.

9 Therefore, as the soul could never
die, and the “fall had brought upon
all mankind a spiritual *death as
well as a temporal, that is, they
were cut off from the presence
of the Lord, it was expedient that
mankind should be reclaimed from
this spiritual death.

10 Therefore, as they had become
“carnal, sensual, and devilish, by
‘nature, this ‘probationary state be-
came a State for them to prepare; it
became a preparatory state.

11 And now remember, my son,
if it were not for the plan of re-
demption, (laying it aside) as soon
as they were dead their souls were
“miserable, being cut off from the
presence of the Lord.

12 And now, there was no means
to reclaim men from this fallen
state, which *man had brought
upon himself because of his own
’disobedience;

13 Therefore, according to justice,
the “plan of ’redemption could not
be brought about, only on condi-
tions of repentance of men in this
probationary state, yea, this prepar-
atory state; for except it were for
these conditions, mercy could not
take effect except it should destroy
the work of justice. Now the work
of justice could not be destroyed;
if so, God would ‘cease to be God.

14 And thus we see that all man-
kind were “fallen, and they were in

 

the grasp of ‘justice; yea, the justice
of God, which consigned them for-
ever to be cut off from his presence.

15 And now, the plan of mercy
could not be brought about except
an atonement should be made;
therefore God himself ¢atoneth for
the sins of the world, to bring about
the plan of 'mercy, to appease the
demands of ‘justice, that God might
be a “perfect, just God, and a ‘mer-
ciful God also.

16 Now, repentance could not come
unto men except there were a “pun-
ishment, which also was eternal as
the life of the soul should be, af-
fixed ‘opposite to the plan of hap-
piness, which was as “eternal also
as the life of the soul.

17 Now, how could a man repent
except he should “sin? How could
he sin if there was no "law? How
could there be a law save there was
a punishment?

18 Now, there was a punishment
affixed, and a just law given, which
brought remorse of “conscience
unto man.

19 Now, if there was no law given—
if a man “murdered he should *’die—
would he be afraid he would die if
he should murder?

20 And also, if there was no law
given against sin men would not
be afraid to sin.

21 And if there was “no law given,
if men sinned what could justice
do, or mercy either, for they would
have no claim upon the creature?

22 But there is a law given, anda
