of Moses; for they understood not
the saying that ‘old things had
passed away, and that all things
had become new.

3 And he said unto them: Marvel
not that I said unto you that old
things had passed away, and that
all things had become “new.

4 Behold, I say unto you that the
“law is fulfilled that was given unto
Moses.

5 Behold, “I am he that gave the
law, and I am he who covenanted
with my people Israel; therefore,
the law in me is fulfilled, for I have
come to °fulfil the law; therefore it
hath an end.

6 Behold, I do “not destroy the
prophets, for as many as have not
been fulfilled in me, verily Isay unto
you, shall all be fulfilled.

7 And because I said unto you that
old things have passed away, I do not
destroy that which hath been spoken
concerning things which are to come.

8 For behold, the ¢covenant which

16 This much did the Father “com-
