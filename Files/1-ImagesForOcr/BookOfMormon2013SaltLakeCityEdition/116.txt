as the Spirit hath constrained me;
wherefore, I know that they must
surely come to pass.

2 And the things which shall be
written out of the “book shall be of
great °worth unto the children of
men, and especially unto our seed,
which is a ‘remnant of the house
of Israel.

3 For it shall come to pass in that
day that the “churches which are built
up, and not unto the Lord, when the
one shall say unto the other: Behold,
I, am the Lord’s; and the others shall
say: I, lam the Lord’s; and thus shall
every one say that hath built up
*churches, and not unto the Lord—

4 And they shall contend one with
another; and their priests shall con-
tend one with another, and they
shall teach with their “learning,
and deny the *Holy Ghost, which
giveth utterance.

5 And they ‘deny the °power of
God, the Holy One of Israel; and
they say unto the people: Hearken
unto us, and hear ye our precept;
for behold there is ‘no God today,
for the Lord and the Redeemer hath
done his work, and he hath given
his power unto men;

6 Behold, hearken ye unto my
precept; if they shall say there is a
miracle wrought by the hand of the
Lord, believe it not; for this day he
is not a God of “miracles; he hath
done his work.

 

7 Yea, and there shall be many
which shall say: “Eat, drink, and be
merry, for tomorrow we die; and it
shall be well with us.

8 And there shall also be many
which shall say: “Eat, drink, and be
’merry; nevertheless, fear God—he
will ‘justify in committing a little
4sin; yea, ‘lie a little, take the advan-
tage of one because of his words,
dig a ‘pit for thy neighbor; there is
“no harm in this; and do all these
things, for tomorrow we die; and if
it so be that we are guilty, God will
beat us with a few stripes, and at
last we shall be saved in the king-
dom of God.

9 Yea, and there shall be many
which shall teach after this manner,
“false and vain and °foolish ‘doc-
trines, and shall be puffed up in
their hearts, and shall seek deep to
hide their counsels from the Lord;
and their works shall be in the dark.

10 And the “blood of the saints shall
cry from the ground against them.

11 Yea, they have all gone out of the
‘way; they have become ’corrupted.

12 Because of “pride, and because
of *false teachers, and ‘false doc-
trine, their churches have become
corrupted, and their churches are
lifted up; because of pride they are
puffed up.

13 They “rob the °poor because of
their fine sanctuaries; they rob the
poor because of their fine clothing;
