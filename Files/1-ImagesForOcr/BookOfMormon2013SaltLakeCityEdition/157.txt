7 For the multitude being so great
that king Benjamin could not teach
them all within the walls of the
temple, therefore he caused a “tower
to be erected, that thereby his peo-
ple might hear the words which he
should speak unto them.

8 And it came to pass that he be-
gan to speak to his people from the
tower; and they could not all hear
his words because of the greatness
of the multitude; therefore he caused
that the words which he spake
should be written and sent forth
among those that were not under the
sound of his voice, that they might
also receive his words.

9 And these are the words which
he “spake and caused to be written,
saying: My brethren, all ye that have
assembled yourselves together, you
that can hear my words which I
shall speak unto you this day; for I
have not commanded you to come
up hither to *trifle with the words
which I shall speak, but that you
should ‘hearken unto me, and open
your ears that ye may hear, and your
4hearts that ye may understand, and
your ‘minds that the ‘mysteries of
God may be unfolded to your view.

10 I have not commanded you to
come up hither that ye should fear
«me, or that ye should think that Lof
myself am more than a mortal man.

11 But I am like as yourselves,
subject to all manner of infirmities
in body and mind; yet I have been
chosen by this people, and “conse-
crated by my father, and was suf-
fered by the hand of the Lord that
Ishould be a ruler and a king over
this people; and have been kept and
preserved by his matchless power, to

 

serve you with all the might, mind
and strength which the Lord hath
granted unto me.

121 say unto you that as I have
been suffered to “spend my days in
your service, even up to this time,
and have not sought *gold nor silver
nor any manner of riches of you;

13 Neither have I suffered that ye
should be confined in dungeons,
nor that ye should make slaves one
of another, nor that ye should mur-
der, or plunder, or steal, or commit
adultery; nor even have I suffered
that ye should commit any manner
of wickedness, and have taught you
that ye should keep the command-
ments of the Lord, in all things
which he hath commanded you—

14 And even I, myself, have ¢la-
bored with mine own *hands that I
might serve you, and that ye should
not be ‘laden with taxes, and that
there should nothing come upon you
which was grievous to be borne—
and of all these things which I have
spoken, ye yourselves are witnesses
this day.

15 Yet, my brethren, I have not
done these things that I might
“boast, neither do | tell these things
that thereby I might accuse you;
but I tell you these things that ye
may know that I can answer a clear
’conscience before God this day.

16 Behold, I say unto you that
because I said unto you that I had
spent my days in your service, 1 do
not desire to boast, for I have only
been in the service of God.

17 And behold, I tell you these
things that ye may learn “wisdom;
that ye may learn that when ye are
in the service of your ‘fellow beings
