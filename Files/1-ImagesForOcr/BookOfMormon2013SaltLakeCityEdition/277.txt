“converted, save only one; neither
were any of the ‘Amulonites; but they
did harden their hearts, and also
the hearts of the Lamanites in that
part of the land wheresoever they
dwelt, yea, and all their villages and
all their cities.

15 Therefore, we have named all
the cities of the Lamanites in which
they did repent and come to the
knowledge of the truth, and were
converted.

16 And now it came to pass that the
king and those who were converted
were desirous that they might have
aname, that thereby they might be
distinguished from their brethren;
therefore the king consulted with
Aaron and many of their priests, con-
cerning the name that they should
take upon them, that they might
be distinguished.

17 And it came to pass that they
called their names “Anti-Nephi-
Lehies; and they were called by
this name and were no more called
>’Lamanites.

18 And they began to be a very
“industrious people; yea, and they
were friendly with the Nephites;
therefore, they did open a corre-
spondence with them, and the ‘curse
of God did no more follow them.

CHAPTER 24

The Lamanites come against the people
of God—The Anti-Nephi-Lehies rejoice
in Christ and are visited by angels—
They choose to suffer death rather than
to defend themselves—More Lamanites
are converted. About 90-77 B.c.

AND it came to pass that the Amale-
kites and the Amulonites and the
Lamanites who were in the land
of “Amulon, and also in the land of
*Helam, and who were in the land
of ‘Jerusalem, and in fine, in all the

 

land round about, who had not been
converted and had not taken upon
them the name of “Anti-Nephi-Lehi,
were stirred up by the Amalekites
and by the Amulonites to anger
against their brethren.

2 And their hatred became ex-
ceedingly sore against them, even
insomuch that they began to rebel
against their king, insomuch that
they would not that he should be
their king; therefore, they took up
arms against the people of Anti-
Nephi-Lehi.

3 Now the king conferred the king-
dom upon his son, and he called his
name Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

4 And the king died in that self-
same year that the Lamanites be-
gan to make preparations for war
against the people of God.

5 Now when Ammon and his breth-
ren and all those who had come up
with him saw the preparations of
the Lamanites to destroy their breth-
ren, they came forth to the land of
Midian, and there Ammon met all
his brethren; and from thence they
came to the land of Ishmael that
they might hold a “council with
Lamoni and also with his brother
Anti-Nephi-Lehi, what they should
do to defend themselves against the
Lamanites.

6 Now there was not one soul
among all the people who had been
converted unto the Lord that would
take up arms against their brethren;
nay, they would not even make any
preparations for war; yea, and also
their king commanded them that
they should not.

7 Now, these are the words which
he said unto the people concern-
ing the matter: I thank my God,
my beloved people, that our great
God has in goodness sent these our
brethren, the Nephites, unto us to
