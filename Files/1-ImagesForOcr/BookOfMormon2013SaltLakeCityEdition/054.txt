¢God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob, “yieldeth himself,
according to the words of the angel,
as aman, into the hands of ‘wicked
men, to be ‘lifted up, according to
the words of *Zenock, and to be
"crucified, according to the words
of Neum, and to be buried ina ‘sep-
ulchre, according to the words of
iZenos, which he spake concerning
the three days of “darkness, which
should be a sign given of his death
unto those who should inhabit the
isles of the sea, more especially
given unto those who are of the
‘house of Israel.
