“Heth had perished by the famine,
and all his household save it were
Shez—wherefore, Shez began to
build up again a broken people.

2 And it came to pass that Shez
did remember the destruction of
his fathers, and he did build up a
righteous kingdom; for he remem-
bered what the Lord had done in
bringing Jared and his brother
“across the deep; and he did walk
in the ways of the Lord; and he be-
gat sons and daughters.

3 And his eldest son, whose name
was Shez, did “rebel against him;
nevertheless, Shez was smitten by
the hand of a robber, because of his
exceeding riches, which brought
peace again unto his father.

4 And it came to pass that his
father did build up many cities
upon the face of the land, and the
people began again to spread over
all the face of the land. And Shez
did live to an exceedingly old age;
and he begat Riplakish. And he died,
and Riplakish reigned in his stead.

5 And it came to pass that Rip-
lakish did not do that which was
right in the sight of the Lord, for he
did have many wives and “concu-
bines, and did lay that upon men’s
shoulders which was grievous to be
borne; yea, he did *tax them with
heavy taxes; and with the taxes he
did build many spacious buildings.

6 And he did erect him an exceed-
ingly beautiful throne; and he did
build many prisons, and whoso
would not be subject unto taxes he
did “cast into prison; and whoso was
not able to pay taxes he did cast
into prison; and he did cause that
they should labor continually for
their support; and whoso refused
to labor he did cause to be put
to death.

7 Wherefore he did obtain all his
fine work, yea, even his fine “gold
he did cause to be refined in prison;

 

and all manner of fine °workman-
ship he did cause to be wrought
in prison. And it came to pass that
he did afflict the people with his
whoredoms and abominations.

8 And when he had reigned for the
space of forty and two years the peo-
ple did rise up in rebellion against
him; and there began to be war
again in the land, insomuch that
Riplakish was killed, and his descen-
dants were driven out of the land.

9 And it came to pass after the
space of many years, Morianton, (he
being a descendant of Riplakish)
gathered together an army of out-
casts, and went forth and gave bat-
tle unto the people; and he gained
power over many cities; and the war
became exceedingly sore, and did
last for the space of many years;
and he did gain power over all the
land, and did establish himself king
over all the land.

10 And after that he had estab-
lished himself king he did ease the
burden of the people, by which he
did gain favor in the eyes of the
people, and they did anoint him
to be their king.

11 And he did do justice unto
the people, but not unto himself
because of his many “~whoredoms;
wherefore he was cut off from the
presence of the Lord.

12 And it came to pass that Mori-
anton built up many cities, and the
people became exceedingly rich
under his reign, both in buildings,
and in “gold and silver, and in rais-
ing grain, and in flocks, and herds,
and such things which had been
restored unto them.

13 And Morianton did live to an
exceedingly great age, and then he
begat Kim; and Kim did reign in
the stead of his father; and he did
reign eight years, and his father
died. And it came to pass that Kim
did “not reign in righteousness,
