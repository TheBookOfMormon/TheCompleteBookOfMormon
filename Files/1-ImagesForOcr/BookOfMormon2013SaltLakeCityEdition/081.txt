of them that afflict thee; who have
said to thy soul: Bow down, that we
may go over—and thou hast laid
thy body as the ground and as the
street to them that went over.

24 ‘Awake, awake, put on thy
’strength, O*Zion; put on thy beau-
tiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy
city; for henceforth there shall 4no
more come into thee the uncircum-
cised and the unclean.

25 Shake thyself from the dust;
arise, sit down, O Jerusalem; loose
thyself from the “bands of thy neck,
O captive daughter of Zion.

CHAPTER 9

Jacob explains that the Jews will be
gathered in all their lands of promise—
The Atonement tansoms man from the
Fall—The bodies of the dead will come
forth from the grave, and their spirits
from hell and from paradise—They will
be judged—The Atonement saves from
death, hell, the devil, and endless tor-
ment—The righteous are to be saved in
the kingdom of God—Penallties for sins
are set forth—The Holy One of Israel is
the keeper of the gate. About 559-545 B.C.

AND now, my beloved brethren, I
have read these things that ye might
know concerning the “covenants of
the Lord that he has covenanted
with all the house of Israel—

2 That he has spoken unto the Jews,
by the mouth of his holy prophets,
even from the beginning down,
from generation to generation, until
the time comes that they shall be

 

“restored to the true church and fold
of God; when they shall be "gathered
home to the ‘lands of their inheri-
tance, and shall be established in
all their lands of promise.

3 Behold, my beloved brethren, I
speak unto you these things that ye
may rejoice, and “lift up your heads
forever, because of the blessings
which the Lord God shall bestow
upon your children.

4 For I know that ye have searched
much, many of you, to know of
things to come; wherefore I know
that ye know that our “flesh must
waste away and die; nevertheless,
in our ’bodies we shall see God.

5 Yea, I know that ye know that in
the body he shall show himself unto
those at Jerusalem, from whence
we came; for it is expedient that it
should be among them; for it be-
hooveth the great “Creator that he
*suffereth himself to become ‘sub-
ject unto man in the flesh, and ‘die
for ‘all men, that all men might be-
come subject unto him.

6 For as “death hath passed upon
all men, to fulfil the merciful "plan
of the great Creator, there must
needs be a power of ‘resurrection,
and the resurrection must needs
come unto man by reason of the
“fall; and the fall came by reason
of ‘transgression; and because man
became fallen they were ‘cut off
from the ¢presence of the Lord.

7 Wherefore, it must needs be
an ‘infinite °atonement—save it
should be an infinite atonement this
