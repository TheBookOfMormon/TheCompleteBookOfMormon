blood of their brethren they would
“give up their own lives; and rather
than take away froma brother they
would give unto him; and rather
than spend their days in idleness
they would labor abundantly with
their hands.

19 And thus we see that, when
these Lamanites were brought to
“believe and to know the truth, they
were *firm, and would suffer even
unto death rather than commit sin;
and thus we see that they buried
their weapons of peace, or they bur-
ied the weapons of war, for peace.

20 And it came to pass that their
brethren, the Lamanites, made pre-
parations for war, and came up to
the land of Nephi for the purpose
of destroying the king, and to place
“another in his stead, and also of
destroying the people of Anti-
Nephi-Lehi out of the land.

21 Now when the people saw that
they were coming against them they
went out to meet them, and “pros-
trated themselves before them to the
earth, and began to call on the name
of the Lord; and thus they were
in this attitude when the Laman-
ites began to fall upon them, and
began to slay them with the sword.

22 And thus without meeting any
resistance, they did slay a“thousand
and five of them; and we know that
they are blessed, for they have gone
to dwell with their God.

23 Now when the Lamanites saw
that their brethren would not flee
from the sword, neither would they
turn aside to the right hand or to the
left, but that they would lie down
and “perish, and *praised God even
in the very act of perishing under
the sword—

24 Now when the Lamanites saw

 

this they did “forbear from slaying
them; and there were many whose
hearts had *swollen in them for those
of their brethren who had fallen
under the sword, for they repented
of the things which they had done.

25 And it came to pass that they
threw down their weapons of war,
and they would not take them
again, for they were stung for the
murders which they had committed;
and they came down even as their
brethren, relying upon the mercies
of those whose arms were lifted to
slay them.

26 And it came to pass that the
people of God were joined that day
by more than the number who had
been slain; and those who had been
slain were righteous people, there-
fore we have no reason to doubt but
what they were “saved.

27 And there was not a wicked man.
slain among them; but there were
more than a thousand brought to
the knowledge of the truth; thus we
see that the Lord worketh in many
“ways to the salvation of his people.

28 Now the greatest number of
those of the Lamanites who slew so
many of their brethren were Amale-
kites and Amulonites, the greatest
number of whom were after the
“order of the 'Nehors.

29 Now, among those who joined
the people of the Lord, there were
‘none who were Amalekites or Amu-
lonites, or who were of the order of
Nehor, but they were actual descen-
dants of Laman and Lemuel.

30 And thus we can plainly dis-
cern, that after a people have been
once “enlightened by the Spirit of
God, and have had great ‘knowledge
of things pertaining to righteous-
ness, and then have “fallen away into
