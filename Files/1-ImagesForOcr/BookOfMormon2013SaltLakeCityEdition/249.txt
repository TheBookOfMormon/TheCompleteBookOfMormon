of redemption would have been frus-
trated, and the word of God would
have been void, taking none effect.

27 But behold, it was not so; but
it was “appointed unto men that
they must die; and after death, they
must come to *judgment, even that
same judgment of which we have
spoken, which is the end.

28 And after God had appointed
that these things should come unto
man, behold, then he saw that it
was expedient that man should
know concerning the things whereof
he had appointed unto them;

29 Therefore he sent “angels to
converse with them, who caused
men to behold of his glory.

30 And they began from that time
forth to call on his name; therefore
God “conversed with men, and made
known unto them the "plan of re-
demption, which had been prepared.
from the ‘foundation of the world;
and this he made known unto them
according to their faith and repen-
tance and their “holy works.

31 Wherefore, he gave “command-
ments unto men, they having first
transgressed the *first command-
ments as to things which were
temporal, and becoming as gods,
“knowing good from evil, placing
themselves in a state to “act, or being
placed ina state to act according to
their wills and pleasures, whether
to do evil or to do good—

32 Therefore God gave unto them
commandments, after having made
*known unto them the plan of re-
demption, that they should not do

 

evil, the penalty thereof being a
second *death, which was an ever-
lasting ‘death as to things pertain-
ing unto righteousness; for on such
the plan of redemption could have
no power, for the works of “justice
could not be destroyed, according
to the supreme ‘goodness of God.

33 But God did call on men, in
the name of his Son, (this being
the “plan of redemption which was
laid) saying: If ye will ’repent, and
harden not your hearts, then will
I have mercy upon you, through
mine Only Begotten Son;

34 Therefore, whosoever repenteth,
and hardeneth not his heart, he shall
have claim on “mercy through mine
Only Begotten Son, unto a ’remis-
sion of his sins; and these shall en-
ter into my ‘rest.

35 And whosoever will harden his
heart and will do “iniquity, behold,
I swear in my wrath that he shall
not enter into my rest.

36 And now, my brethren, be-
hold I say unto you, that if ye will
harden your hearts ye shall not en-
ter into the rest of the Lord; there-
fore your iniquity “provoketh him
that he sendeth down his *wrath
upon you as in the ‘first provoca-
tion, yea, according to his word in
the last provocation as well as the
first, to the everlasting ‘destruction
of your souls; therefore, according
to his word, unto the last death, as
well as the first.

37 And now, my brethren, seeing
we know these things, and they are
true, let us repent, and harden not
