the commandments of God, and

CHAPTER 4

Nephite dissenters and the Lamanites
join forces and take the land of Zara-
hemla—The Nephites’ defeats come be-
cause of their wickedness—The Church
dwindles, and the people become weak
like the Lamanites. About 38-30 B.c.

AND it came to pass in the fifty and
fourth year there were many dis-
sensions in the church, and there
was also a “contention among the
people, insomuch that there was
much bloodshed.

2 And the rebellious part were
slain and driven out of the land,
and they did go unto the king of
the Lamanites.

3 And it came to pass that they did
endeavor to stir up the Lamanites
to “war against the Nephites; but
behold, the Lamanites were "exceed-
ingly afraid, insomuch that they
would not hearken to the words of
those dissenters.

4 But it came to pass in the fifty
and sixth year of the reign of the
judges, there were “dissenters who
went up from the Nephites unto the
Lamanites; and they succeeded with
those others in *stirring them up to
anger against the Nephites; and they
were all that year preparing for war.

5 And in the fifty and seventh
year they did come down against
the Nephites to battle, and they
did commence the work of death;
yea, insomuch that in the fifty and
eighth year of the reign of the judges
they succeeded in obtaining “pos-
session of the land of Zarahemla;
yea, and also all the lands, even unto
the land which was near the land
Bountiful.

6 And the Nephites and the armies

 

of Moronihah were driven even into
the land of Bountiful;

7 And there they did fortify against
the Lamanites, from the west sea,
even unto the east; it being a “day’s
journey for a Nephite, on the line
which they had fortified and sta-
tioned their armies to defend their
north country.

8 And thus those “dissenters of
the Nephites, with the help of a
numerous army of the Lamanites,
had obtained all the possession of
the Nephites which was in the land
southward. And all this was done
in the fifty and eighth and ninth
years of the reign of the judges.

9 And it came to pass in the sixti-
eth year of the reign of the judges,
Moronihah did succeed with his
armies in obtaining many parts of
the land; yea, they regained many
cities which had fallen into the
hands of the Lamanites.

10 And it came to pass in the sixty
and first year of the reign of the
judges they succeeded in regaining
even the half of all their possessions.

11 Now this great loss of the Neph-
ites, and the great slaughter which
was among them, “would not have
happened had it not been for their
*wickedness and their abomination
which was among them; yea, and it
was among those also who professed
to belong to the church of God.

12 And it was because of the “pride
of their hearts, because of their ex-
ceeding riches, yea, it was because
of their oppression to the ‘poor,
withholding their food from the
hungry, withholding their clothing
from the naked, and smiting their
humble brethren upon the cheek,
making a “mock of that which
was sacred, denying the spirit of
prophecy and of revelation, mur-
dering, plundering, lying, stealing,
