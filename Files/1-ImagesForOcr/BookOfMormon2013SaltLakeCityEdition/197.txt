did hear their ’cries, and began to
soften the hearts of the Lamanites
that they began to ease their bur-
dens; yet the Lord did not see fit to
deliver them out of bondage.

16 And it came to pass that they
began to prosper by degrees in the
land, and began to raise grain more
abundantly, and flocks, and herds,
that they did not suffer with hunger.

17 Now there was a great number
of women, more than there was of
men; therefore king Limhi com-
manded that every man should ¢im-
part to the support of the widows
and their children, that they might
not perish with hunger; and this
they did because of the greatness of
their number that had been slain.

18 Now the people of Limhi kept
together in a body as much as it was
possible, and secured their grain
and their flocks;

19 And the king himself did not
trust his person without the walls
of the city, unless he took his guards
with him, fearing that he might by
some means fall into the hands of
the Lamanites.

20 And he caused that his people
should watch the land round about,
that by some means they might take
those priests that fled into the wil-
derness, who had stolen the “daugh-
ters of the Lamanites, and that had
caused such a great destruction to
come upon them.

21 For they were desirous to take
them that they might “punish them;
for they had come into the land
of Nephi by night, and carried off
their grain and many of their pre-
cious things; therefore they laid
wait for them.

22 And it came to pass that there
was no more disturbance between
the Lamanites and the people of

 

Limhi, even until the time that
Ammon and his brethren came
into the land.

23 And the king having been
without the gates of the city with
his guard, “discovered Ammon and
his brethren; and supposing them
to be priests of Noah therefore he
caused that they should be taken,
and bound, and cast into "prison.
And had they been the priests of
Noah he would have caused that
they should be put to death.

24 But when he found that they
were not, but that they were his
brethren, and had come from the
“land of Zarahemla, he was filled
with exceedingly great joy.

25 Now king Limhi had sent, pre-
vious to the coming of Ammon, a
“small number of men to *search
for the land of Zarahemla; but they
could not find it, and they were lost
in the wilderness.

26 Nevertheless, they did find a
land which had been peopled; yea,
a land which was covered with dry
“bones; yea, a land which had been
peopled and which had been de-
stroyed; and they, having supposed
it to be the land of Zarahemla, re-
turned to the land of Nephi, having
arrived in the borders of the land
not many days before the *’coming
of Ammon.

27 And they brought a “record with
them, even a record of the people
whose bones they had found; and
it was engraven on plates of ore.

28 And now Limhi was again filled
with joy on learning from the mouth
of Ammon that king Mosiah had a
«gift from God, whereby he could
*interpret such engravings; yea, and
Ammon also did rejoice.

29 Yet Ammon and his brethren
were filled with sorrow because so
