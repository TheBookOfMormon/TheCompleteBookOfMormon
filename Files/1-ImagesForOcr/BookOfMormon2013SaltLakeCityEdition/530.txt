CHAPTER 7

An invitation is given to enter into
the rest of the Lord—Pray with real
intent—The Spirit of Christ enables
men to know good from evil—Satan
persuades men to deny Christ and do
evil—The prophets manifest the com-
ing of Christ—By faith, miracles are
wrought and angels minister—Men
should hope for eternal life and cleave
unto charity. About A.D. 401-21.

AND now I, Moroni, write a few of
the words of my father Mormon,
which he spake concerning “faith,
hope, and charity; for after this
manner did he speak unto the peo-
ple, as he taught them in the ’syna-
gogue which they had built for the
place of worship.

2 And now I, Mormon, speak unto
you, my beloved brethren; and it
is by the “grace of God the Father,
and our Lord Jesus Christ, and his
holy will, because of the gift of his
*calling unto me, that lam permit-
ted to speak unto you at this time.

3 Wherefore, I would speak unto
you that are of the ¢church, that are
the *peaceable followers of Christ,
and that have obtained a sufficient
‘hope by which ye can enter into
the ¢rest of the Lord, from this time
henceforth until ye shall rest with
him in heaven.

4 And now my brethren, I judge
these things of you because of your
peaceable “walk with the children
of men.

 

5 For [remember the word of God
which saith by their ¢works ye shall
know them; for if their works be
good, then they are good also.

6 For behold, God hath said a man.
being “evil cannot do that which is
good; for if he *offereth a gift, or
“prayeth unto God, except he shall
do it with real ‘intent it profiteth
him nothing.

7 For behold, it is not counted unto
him for righteousness.

8 For behold, if a man being “evil
giveth a gift, he doeth it grudgingly;
wherefore it is counted unto him
the same as if he had retained the
gift; wherefore he is counted evil
before God.

9 And likewise also is it counted
evil unto a man, if he shall pray
and not with “real intent of heart;
yea, and it profiteth him nothing,
for God receiveth none such.

10 Wherefore, a man being evil
cannot do that which is good; nei-
ther will he give a good gift.

11 For behold, a bitter “fountain
cannot bring forth good water; nei-
ther cana good fountain bring forth
bitter water; wherefore, a man being
aservant of the devil cannot follow
Christ; and if he *follow Christ he
cannot be a ‘servant of the devil.

12 Wherefore, all things which
are “good cometh of God; and that
which is *evil cometh of the devil;
for the devil is an enemy unto God,
and fighteth against him continu-
ally, and inviteth and enticeth
