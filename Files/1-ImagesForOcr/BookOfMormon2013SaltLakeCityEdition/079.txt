ye are weary he waketh morning
by morning. He waketh mine ear
to hear as the learned.

5 The Lord God hath opened mine
“ear, and I was not rebellious, nei-
ther turned away back.

61 gave my back to the “smiter,
and my cheeks to them that plucked
off the hair. I hid not my face from
’shame and spitting.

7 For the Lord God will help me,
therefore shall I not be confounded.
Therefore have I set my face like
a flint, and I know that I shall not
be ‘ashamed.

8 And the Lord is near, and he “jus-
tifieth me. Who will contend with
me? Let us stand together. Who is
mine adversary? Let him come near
me, and I will smite him with the
strength of my mouth.

9 For the Lord God will help me.
And all they who shall “condemn
me, behold, all they shall ’wax old
as a garment, and the moth shall
eat them up.

10 Who is among you that feareth
the Lord, that obeyeth the “voice of
his servant, that *walketh in dark-
ness and hath no light?

11 Behold all ye that kindle fire,
that compass yourselves about with
sparks, walk in the light of “your
fire and in the sparks which ye have
kindled. *This shall ye have of mine
hand—ye shall lie down in sorrow.

CHAPTER 8

after righteousness. Look unto the
’rock from whence ye are hewn, and
to the hole of the pit from whence
ye are digged.

2 Look unto Abraham, your “father,
and unto *Sarah, she that bare you;
for I called him alone, and blessed
him.

3 For the Lord shall “comfort *Zion,
he will comfort all her waste places;
and he will make her ‘wilderness
like ‘Eden, and her desert like the
garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness
shall be found therein, thanksgiv-
ing and the voice of melody.

4 Hearken unto me, my people; and
give ear unto me, O my nation; for
a “law shall proceed from me, and
I will make my judgment to rest
for a ‘light for the people.

5 My righteousness is near; my
“salvation is gone forth, and mine
arm shall *judge the people. The
‘isles shall wait upon me, and on
mine arm shall they trust.

6 Lift up your eyes to the “heavens,
and look upon the earth beneath;
for the heavens shall vanish away
like smoke, and the earth shall
‘wax old like a garment; and they
that dwell therein shall die in like
manner. But my salvation shall be
forever, and my righteousness shall
