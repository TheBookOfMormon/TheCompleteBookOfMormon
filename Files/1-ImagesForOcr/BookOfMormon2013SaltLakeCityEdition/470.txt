me, after that I am gone to the
Father?

2 And they all spake, save it were
three, saying: We desire that after
we have lived unto the age of man,
that our ministry, wherein thou
hast called us, may have an end,
that we may speedily come unto
thee in thy kingdom.

3 And he said unto them: Blessed
are ye because ye desired this thing
of me; therefore, after that ye are
“seventy and two years old ye shall
come unto me in my *kingdom; and
with me ye shall find ‘rest.

4 And when he had spoken unto
them, he turned himself unto the
three, and said unto them: What
will ye that I should do unto you,
when I am gone unto the Father?

5 And they sorrowed in their
hearts, for they durst not speak unto
him the thing which they desired.

6 And he said unto them: Behold,
1¢know your thoughts, and ye have
desired the thing which *John, my
beloved, who was with me in my
ministry, before that I was lifted up
by the Jews, desired of me.

7 Therefore, more blessed are ye,
for ye shall “never taste of death;
but ye shall live to behold all the do-

of men, even until all things shall
be fulfilled according to the will of
the Father, when I shall come in my

12 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had spoken these words, he
touched every one of them with his
finger save it were the “three who
were to tarry, and then he departed.

13 And behold, the heavens were
opened, and they were “caught up
into heaven, and saw and heard
unspeakable things.

14 And it was “forbidden them
that they should utter; neither was
it given unto them "power that they
