“tongues and their doings have
been against the Lord, to ‘provoke
the eyes of his glory.

9 The show of their countenance
doth witness against them, and
doth declare their “sin to be even
as "Sodom, and they cannot hide it.
Wo unto their souls, for they have
rewarded evil unto themselves!

10 Say unto the righteous that it is
4well with them; for they shall °eat
the fruit of their doings.

11 Wo unto the wicked, for they
shall perish; for the reward of their
hands shall be upon them!

12 And my people, children are
their oppressors, and women rule
over them. O my people, they who
“lead thee cause thee to err and de-
stroy the way of thy paths.

13 The Lord standeth up to “plead,
and standeth to judge the people.

14 The Lord will enter into “judg-
ment with the ancients of his peo-
ple and the princes thereof; for ye
have eaten up the vineyard and the
spoil of the ‘poor in your houses.

15 What mean ye? Ye “beat my
people to pieces, and grind the
faces of the poor, saith the Lord
God of Hosts.

16 Moreover, the Lord saith: Be-
cause the daughters of Zion are
*haughty, and *walk with stretched-
forth necks and wanton eyes, walk-
ing and mincing as they go, and
making a tinkling with their feet—

17 Therefore the Lord will smite
with a “scab the crown of the head
of the daughters of Zion, and the
Lord will *discover their secret
parts.

 

18 In that “day the Lord will take
away the bravery of their tinkling
ornaments, and cauls, and round
tires like the moon;

19 The chains and the bracelets,
and the mufflers;

20 The bonnets, and the ornaments
of the legs, and the headbands, and
the tablets, and the ear-rings;

21 The rings, and nose jewels;

22 The changeable suits of apparel,
and the mantles, and the wimples,
and the crisping-pins;

23 The glasses, and the fine linen,
and hoods, and the veils.

24 And it shall come to pass, in-
stead of sweet smell there shall be
stink; and instead of a girdle, a rent;
and instead of well set hair, “bald-
ness; and instead of a stomacher, a
girding of sackcloth; *burning in-
stead of “beauty.

25 Thy men shall fall by the sword
and thy mighty in the war.

26 And her “gates shall lament and
’mourn; and she shall be desolate,
and shall ‘sit upon the ground.

CHAPTER 14

Zion and her daughters will be redeemed
and cleansed in the millennial day—
Compare Isaiah 4. About 559-545 B.C.

“AND in that day, seven women shall
take hold of one man, saying: We
will eat our own bread, and wear
our own apparel; only let us be
called by thy name to take away
our ’reproach.

2 In that day shall the “branch of
the Lord be beautiful and glorious;
the fruit of the earth excellent and
