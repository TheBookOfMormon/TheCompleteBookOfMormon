21 And thus Moroni put an end to
those king-men, that there were not
any known by the appellation of
king-men; and thus he put an end
to the stubbornness and the pride
of those people who professed the
blood of nobility; but they were
brought down to humble them-
selves like unto their brethren, and
to fight ‘valiantly for their freedom
from bondage.

22 Behold, it came to pass that
while Moroni was thus breaking
down the wars and contentions
among his own people, and subject-
ing them to peace and civilization,
and making regulations to prepare
for war against the Lamanites, be-
hold, the Lamanites had come into
the ¢land of Moroni, which was in
the borders by the seashore.

23 And it came to pass that the
Nephites were not sufficiently
strong in the city of Moroni; there-
fore Amalickiah did drive them,
slaying many. And it came to pass
that Amalickiah took possession of
the city, yea, possession of all their
fortifications.

24 And those who fled out of the
“city of Moroni came to the city of
Nephihah; and also the people of
the city of Lehi gathered themselves
together, and made preparations
and were ready to receive the La-
manites to battle.

25 But it came to pass that Amalick-
iah would not suffer the Lamanites
to go against the city of Nephihah
to battle, but kept them down by
the seashore, leaving men in every
city to maintain and defend it.

26 And thus he went on, taking
possession of ‘many cities, the city
of *Nephihah, and the city of ‘Lehi,
and the city of “Morianton, and
the city of Omner, and the city of
*Gid, and the city of Mulek, all of

 

which were on the east borders by
the seashore.

27 And thus had the Lamanites
obtained, by the cunning of Amal-
ickiah, so many cities, by their
numberless hosts, all of which were
strongly fortified after the manner
of the “fortifications of Moroni; all
of which afforded strongholds for
the Lamanites.

28 And it came to pass that they
marched to the “borders of the land
Bountiful, driving the Nephites be-
fore them and slaying many.

29 But it came to pass that they
were met by Teancum, who had
“slain Morianton and had *headed
his people in his flight.

30 And it came to pass that he
headed Amalickiah also, as he was
marching forth with his numerous
army that he might take possession
of the land Bountiful, and also the
land “northward.

31 But behold he met with a dis-
appointment by being repulsed
by Teancum and his men, for they
were great warriors; for every man.
of Teancum did exceed the La-
manites in their strength and in
their skill of war, insomuch that
they did gain advantage over the
Lamanites.

32 And it came to pass that they
did harass them, insomuch that
they did slay them even until it was
dark. And it came to pass that Te-
ancum and his men did pitch their
tents in the borders of the land
Bountiful; and Amalickiah did
pitch his tents in the borders on
the beach by the seashore, and after
this manner were they driven.

33 And it came to pass that when
the night had come, Teancum and
his servant stole forth and went out
by night, and went into the camp
of Amalickiah; and behold, sleep
