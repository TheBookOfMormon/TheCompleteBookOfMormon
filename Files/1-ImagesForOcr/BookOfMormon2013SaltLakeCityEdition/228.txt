redemption of him who “created
you? Do you look forward with an
eye of faith, and view this mortal
body raised in immortality, and
this corruption *raised in incor-
ruption, to stand before God to
be ‘judged according to the deeds
which have been done in the mortal
body?

16 I say unto you, can you imagine
to yourselves that ye hear the voice
of the Lord, saying unto you, in that
day: Come unto me ye “blessed, for
behold, your works have been the
works of righteousness upon the
face of the earth?

17 Or do ye “imagine to yourselves
that ye can lie unto the Lord in
that day, and *say—Lord, our works
have been righteous works upon
the face of the earth—and that he
will save you?

18 Or otherwise, can ye imagine
yourselves brought before the tri-
bunal of God with your souls filled
with guilt and remorse, having a
remembrance of all your guilt, yea,
a perfect “remembrance of all your
wickedness, yea, a remembrance
that ye have set at defiance the
commandments of God?

19 I say unto you, can ye look up
to God at that day with a pure heart
and clean hands? I say unto you,
can you look up, having the “image
of God engraven upon your counte-
nances?

20 I say unto you, can ye think of
being saved when you have yielded
yourselves to become “subjects to
the devil?

21 I say unto you, ye will know at
that day that ye cannot be “saved;

 

for there can no man be saved
except his *’garments are washed
white; yea, his garments must be
“purified until they are cleansed
from all stain, through the blood
of him of whom it has been spo-
ken by our fathers, who should
come to redeem his people from
their sins.

22 And now Lask of you, my breth-
ren, how will any of you feel, if ye
shall stand before the bar of God,
having your garments stained with
“blood and all manner of *filthiness?
Behold, what will these things tes-
tify against you?

23 Behold will they not “testify
that ye are murderers, yea, and also
that ye are *guilty of all manner of
wickedness?

24 Behold, my brethren, do ye
suppose that such an one can have
a place to sit down in the king-
dom of God, with “Abraham, with
Isaac, and with Jacob, and also all
the holy prophets, whose garments
are cleansed and are spotless, pure
and white?

25 | say unto you, Nay; except ye
make our Creator a liar from the
beginning, or suppose that he isa
liar from the beginning, ye cannot
suppose that such can have place
in the kingdom of heaven; but
they shall be cast out for they are
the ‘children of the kingdom of
the devil.

26 And now behold, I say unto you,
my brethren, if ye have experienced
a “change of heart, and if ye have
felt to sing the *song of redeem-
ing love, I would ask, ‘can ye feel
so now?
