30 And it came to pass that
Hearthom reigned in the stead of
his father. And when Hearthom had
reigned twenty and four years, be-
hold, the kingdom was taken away
from him. And he served many
years in “captivity, yea, even all the
remainder of his days.

31 And he begat Heth, and Heth
lived in captivity all his days. And
Heth begat Aaron, and Aaron dwelt
in captivity all his days; and he be-
gat Amnigaddah, and Amnigaddah
also dwelt in captivity all his days;
and he begat Coriantum, and Cori-
antum dwelt in captivity all his
days; and he begat Com.

32 And it came to pass that Com
drew away the half of the kingdom.
And he reigned over the half of
the kingdom forty and two years;
and he went to battle against the
king, Amgid, and they fought for
the space of many years, during
which time Com gained power over
Amgid, and obtained power over the
remainder of the kingdom.

33 And in the days of Com there
began to be robbers in the land; and
they adopted the old plans, and ad-
ministered ‘oaths after the manner
of the ancients, and sought again
to destroy the kingdom.

34 Now Com did fight against
them much; nevertheless, he did
not prevail against them.

CHAPTER 11

Wars, dissensions, and wickedness
dominate Jaredite life—Prophets predict
the utter destruction of the Jaredites
unless they repent—The people reject
the words of the prophets.

AND there came also in the days of
Com many “prophets, and prophe-
sied of the destruction of that great
people except they should repent,
and turn unto the Lord, and forsake
their murders and wickedness.

 

2 And it came to pass that the
prophets were ‘rejected by the
people, and they fled unto Com for
protection, for the people sought to
destroy them.

3 And they prophesied unto Com
many things; and he was blessed in
all the remainder of his days.

4 And he lived to a good old age,
and begat Shiblom; and Shiblom
reigned in his stead. And the brother
of Shiblom rebelled against him,
and there began to be an exceed-
ingly great war in all the land.

5 And it came to pass that the
brother of Shiblom caused that all
the prophets who prophesied of the
destruction of the people should be
put to “death;

6 And there was great calamity in
all the land, for they had testified
that a great curse should come upon
the land, and also upon the people,
and that there should be a great de-
struction among them, such an one
as never had been upon the face of
the earth, and their bones should
become as “heaps of earth upon the
face of the land except they should
repent of their wickedness.

7 And they hearkened not unto the
voice of the Lord, because of their
wicked combinations; wherefore,
there began to be wars and “conten-
tions in all the land, and also many
famines and pestilences, insomuch
that there was a great destruction,
such an one as never had been
known upon the face of the earth;
and all this came to pass in the days
of Shiblom.

8 And the people began to repent
of their iniquity; and inasmuch as
they did the Lord did have “mercy
on them.

9 And it came to pass that Shiblom
was slain, and Seth was brought
into ¢captivity, and did dwell in
captivity all his days.

10 And it came to pass that Ahah,
