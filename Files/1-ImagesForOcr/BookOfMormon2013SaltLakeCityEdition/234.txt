vessel, who shall be overshadowed
and ‘conceive by the power of the
Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son,
yea, even the Son of God.

11 And he shall go forth, suffering
pains and afflictions and *tempta-
tions of every kind; and this that the
word might be fulfilled which saith
he will ‘take upon him the pains
and the sicknesses of his people.

12 And he will take upon him
“death, that he may “loose the bands
of death which bind his people;
and he will take upon him their
infirmities, that his bowels may be
filled with mercy, according to the
flesh, that he may know according
to the flesh how to “succor his peo-
ple according to their infirmities.

13 Now the Spirit “knoweth all
things; nevertheless the Son of God
suffereth according to the *flesh that
he might ‘take upon him the sins of
his people, that he might blot out
their transgressions according to
the power of his deliverance; and
now behold, this is the testimony
which is in me.

14 Now I say unto you that ye
must “repent, and be born again;
for the Spirit saith if ye are not
born again ye cannot inherit the
kingdom of heaven; therefore come
and be baptized unto repentance,
that ye may be washed from your
sins, that ye may have faith on the
Lamb of God, who taketh away the
sins of the world, who is mighty
to save and to cleanse from all un-
righteousness.

15 Yea, I say unto you come and
fear not, and lay aside every sin,
which easily doth “beset you, which
doth bind you down to destruction,
yea, come and go forth, and show
unto your God that ye are willing

 

to repent of your sins and enter
into a covenant with him to keep
his commandments, and witness
it unto him this day by going into
the waters of baptism.

16 And whosoever doeth this,
and keepeth the commandments
of God from thenceforth, the same
will “remember that I say unto him,
yea, he will remember that I have
said unto him, he shall have eter-
nal life, according to the testimony
of the Holy Spirit, which testifieth
in me.

17 And now my beloved brethren,
do you believe these things? Be-
hold, I say unto you, yea, I know
that ye believe them; and the way
that I know that ye believe them is
by the manifestation of the Spirit
which is in me. And now because
your faith is strong concerning that,
yea, concerning the things which I
have spoken, great is my joy.

18 For as I said unto you from the
beginning, that I had much desire
that ye were not in the state of “di-
lemma like your brethren, even so
I have found that my desires have
been gratified.

19 For I perceive that ye are in
the paths of righteousness; I per-
ceive that ye are in the path which
leads to the kingdom of God; yea,
I perceive that ye are making his
“paths straight.

20 I perceive that it has been made
known unto you, by the testimony
of his word, that he cannot ¢walk
in crooked paths; neither doth he
vary from that which he hath said;
neither hath he a shadow of turning
from the right to the left, or from
that which is right to that which is
wrong; therefore, his course is one
eternal round.
