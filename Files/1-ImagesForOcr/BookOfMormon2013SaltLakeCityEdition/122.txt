baptism are the gate to the strait and
narrow path—Eternal life comes to
those who keep the commandments after
baptism. About 559-545 B.c.

AND now I, Nephi, make an end of
my “prophesying unto you, my be-
loved brethren. And I cannot write
but a few things, which I know must
surely come to pass; neither can 1
write but a few of the words of my
brother Jacob.

2 Wherefore, the things which I
have written sufficeth me, save it
be a few words which I “must speak
concerning the doctrine of Christ;
wherefore, I shall speak unto you
plainly, according to the plainness
of my prophesying.

3 For my soul delighteth in “plain-
ness; for after this manner doth the
Lord God work among the children
of men. For the Lord God giveth
light unto the understanding; for
he speaketh unto men according
to their ‘language, unto their un-
derstanding.

4 Wherefore, I would that ye
should remember that I have spoken.
unto you concerning that ¢prophet
which the Lord showed unto me,
that should baptize the ‘Lamb of
God, which should take away the
sins of the world.

5 And now, if the Lamb of God, he
being “holy, should have need to
be baptized by water, to fulfil all
righteousness, O then, how much
more need have we, being unholy,
to be ‘baptized, yea, even by water!

6 And now, I would ask of you, my
beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb

 

of God did fulfil all righteousness
in being baptized by water?

7 Know ye not that he was holy?
But notwithstanding he being holy,
he showeth unto the children of
men that, according to the flesh he
humbleth himself before the Father,
and witnesseth unto the Father that
he would be “obedient unto him in
keeping his commandments.

8 Wherefore, after he was baptized
with water the Holy Ghost descended
upon him in the “form of a *dove.

9 And again, it showeth unto the
children of men the straitness of the
path, and the narrowness of the “gate,
by which they should enter, he hav-
ing set the "example before them.

10 And he said unto the children
of men: “Follow thou me. Where-
fore, my beloved brethren, can we
’follow Jesus save we shall be will-
ing to keep the commandments of
the Father?

11 And the Father said: Repent ye,
repent ye, and be baptized in the
name of my Beloved Son.

12 And also, the voice of the Son
came unto me, saying: He that is
baptized in my name, to him will
the Father “give the Holy Ghost,
like unto me; wherefore, follow
me, and do the things which ye
have seen me do.

13 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, I know that if ye shall “follow
the Son, with full purpose of heart,
acting no *hypocrisy and no de-
ception before God, but with real
“intent, repenting of your sins, wit-
nessing unto the Father that ye are
4willing to take upon you the ‘name
