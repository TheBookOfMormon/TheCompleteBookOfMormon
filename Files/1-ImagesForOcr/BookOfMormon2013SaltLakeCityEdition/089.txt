“led away from time to time from
the house of Israel, according to his
willand pleasure. And now behold,
the Lord remembereth all them who
have been broken off, wherefore he
remembereth us also.

23 Therefore, ‘cheer up your hearts,
and remember that ye are °free to
‘act for yourselves—to “choose the
way of everlasting death or the way
of eternal life.

24 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, “reconcile yourselves to the
>will of God, and not to the will of
the devil and the flesh; and remem-
ber, after ye are reconciled unto
God, that it is only in and through
the ‘grace of God that ye are “saved.

25 Wherefore, may God “raise you
from death by the power of the res-
urrection, and also from everlasting
death by the power of the *atone-
ment, that ye may be received into
the ‘eternal kingdom of God, that
ye may praise him through grace
divine. Amen.

has “seen him as I have seen him;
wherefore, I will send their words
forth unto my children to prove
unto them that my words are true.
Wherefore, by the words of *three,
God hath said, I will establish my
word. Nevertheless, God sendeth
more ‘witnesses, and he proveth
all his words.

4 Behold, my soul delighteth in
“proving unto my people the truth
of the *coming of Christ; for, for
this end hath the ‘law of Moses
been given; and all things which
have been given of God from the
beginning of the world, unto man,
are the ‘typifying of him.

5 And also my soul delighteth in
the “covenants of the Lord which
he hath made to our fathers; yea,
my soul delighteth in his °grace,
and in his justice, and power, and
