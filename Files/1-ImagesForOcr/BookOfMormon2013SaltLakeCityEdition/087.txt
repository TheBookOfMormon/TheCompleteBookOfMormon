CHAPTER 10

Jacob explains that the Jews will crucify
their God—They will be scattered until
they begin to believe in Him—America
will be a land of liberty where no king
will rule—Reconcile yourselves to God
and gain salvation through His grace.
About 559-545 B.C.

AND now I, Jacob, speak unto you
again, my beloved brethren, con-
cerning this righteous “branch of
which I have spoken.

2 For behold, the ‘promises which
we have obtained are promises unto
us according to the flesh; wherefore,
as it has been shown unto me that
many of our children shall perish
in the flesh because of unbelief,
nevertheless, God will be merciful
unto many; and our children shall
be ‘restored, that they may come
to that which will give them the
true knowledge of their Redeemer.

3 Wherefore, as I said unto you,
it must needs be expedient that
Christ—for in the last night the ¢an-
gel spake unto me that this should
be his name—should *come among
the ‘Jews, among those who are the
more wicked part of the world; and
they shall ‘crucify him—for thus
it behooveth our God, and there

be destroyed shall be *scattered
among all nations.

7 But behold, thus saith the “Lord
God: ’When the day cometh that

inheritance.

8 And it shall come to pass that
they shall be “gathered in from
their long dispersion, from the
*isles of the sea, and from the four
parts of the earth; and the nations
of the Gentiles shall be great in the
eyes of me, saith God, in ‘carrying
them forth to the lands of their
inheritance.

9 “Yea, the kings of the Gentiles
shall be nursing fathers unto them,
and their queens shall become nurs-
ing mothers; wherefore, the ’prom-
ises of the Lord are great unto the
Gentiles, for he hath spoken it, and
who can dispute?

10 But behold, this land, said God,
shall be a land of thine inheritance,
and the “Gentiles shall be blessed
upon the land.
