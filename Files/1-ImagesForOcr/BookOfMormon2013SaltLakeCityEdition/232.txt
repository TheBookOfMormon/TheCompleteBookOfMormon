fold, and ye are his sheep; and he
commandeth you that ye suffer no
ravenous wolf to enter among you,
that ye may not be destroyed.

61 And now I, Alma, do command
you in the language of “him who
hath commanded me, that ye ob-
serve to do the words which I have
spoken unto you.

62 1 speak by way of command
unto you that belong to the church;
and unto those who do not belong
to the church I speak by way of
invitation, saying: Come and be
baptized unto repentance, that ye
also may be partakers of the fruit
of the “tree of life.

CHAPTER 6

The Church in Zarahemia is cleansed
and set in order—Alma goes to Gideon
to preach. About 83 B.c.

AND now it came to pass that after
Alma had made an end of speak-
ing unto the people of the church,
which was established in the city of
Zarahemla, he “ordained 'priests
and elders, by laying on his ‘hands
according to the order of God, to
preside and “watch over the church.

2 And it came to pass that whoso-
ever did not belong to the church
who “repented of their sins were
baptized unto repentance, and were
received into the church.

3 And it also came to pass that
whosoever did belong to the church
that did not “repent of their wick-
edness and humble themselves
before God—I mean those who
were lifted up in the pride of their
hearts—the same were rejected,
and their names were ‘blotted out,
that their names were not numbered
among those of the righteous.

4 And thus they began to establish

 

the order of the church in the “city
of Zarahemla.

5 Now I would that ye should un-
derstand that the word of God was
liberal unto all, that none were
deprived of the privilege of assem-
bling themselves together to hear
the word of God.

6 Nevertheless the children of God
were commanded that they should
gather themselves together oft, and
join in “fasting and mighty prayer
in behalf of the welfare of the souls
of those who knew not God.

7 And now it came to pass that
when Alma had made these regu-
lations he departed from them, yea,
from the church which was in the
city of Zarahemla, and went over
upon the east of the “river Sidon, into
the valley of Gideon, there having
been a city built, which was called
the city of Gideon, which was in
the valley that was called Gideon,
being called after the man who was
‘slain by the hand of Nehor with
the sword.

8 And Alma went and began to
declare the word of God unto the
church which was established in
the valley of Gideon, according to
the revelation of the truth of the
word which had been spoken by
his fathers, and according to the
Spirit of prophecy which was in
him, according to the “testimony of
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who
should come to redeem his people
from their sins, and the holy order
by which he was called. And thus
it is written. Amen.

The words of Alma which he
delivered to the people in Gideon,
according to his own record.
