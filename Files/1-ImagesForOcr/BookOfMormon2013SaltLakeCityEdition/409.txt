well, then ye will not find fault
with him.

29 O ye wicked and ye perverse
generation; ye hardened and ye
“stiffnecked people, how long will ye
suppose that the Lord will suffer you?
Yea, how long will ye suffer your-
selves to be led by foolish and ‘blind
guides? Yea, how long will ye 4choose
darkness rather than ‘light?

30 Yea, behold, the anger of the
Lord is already kindled against you;
behold, he hath cursed the land be-
cause of your iniquity.

31 And behold, the time cometh
that he curseth your riches, that
they become ‘slippery, that ye can-
not hold them; and in the days of
your poverty ye cannot retain them.

32 And in the days of your poverty
ye shall cry unto the Lord; and in
vain shall ye cry, for your desolation
is already come upon you, and your
destruction is made sure; and then
shall ye weep and howl in that day,
saith the Lord of Hosts. And then
shall ye lament, and say:

33 O “that I had repented, and
had not killed the prophets, and
’stoned them, and cast them out.
Yea, in that day ye shall say: O
that we had remembered the Lord
our God in the day that he gave us
our riches, and then they would
not have become slippery that we
should lose them; for behold, our
riches are gone from us.

34 Behold, we lay a tool here and
on the morrow it is gone; and be-
hold, our swords are taken from us
in the day we have sought them for
battle.

35 Yea, we have hid up our “trea-
sures and they have slipped away
from us, because of the curse of
the land.

36 O that we had repented in the

 

day that the word of the Lord came
unto us; for behold the land is
cursed, and all things are become
slippery, and we cannot hold them.

37 Behold, we are surrounded by
demons, yea, we are encircled about
by the angels of him who hath
sought to destroy our souls. Behold,
our iniquities are great. O Lord,
canst thou not turn away thine an-
ger from us? And this shall be your
language in those days.

38 But behold, your “days of pro-
bation are past; ye have *procras-
tinated the day of your salvation
until it is everlastingly too late, and
your destruction is made sure; yea,
for ye have sought all the days of
your lives for that which ye could
not obtain; and ye have sought for
‘happiness in doing iniquity, which
thing is “contrary to the nature of
that righteousness which is in our
great and Eternal Head.

39 O ye people of the land, that
ye would hear my words! And I
pray that the anger of the Lord be
turned away from you, and that ye
would repent and be saved.

CHAPTER 14

Samuel predicts light during the night
and a new star at Christ's birth—Christ
redeems men from temporal and spir-
itual death—The signs of His death
include three days of darkness, the rend-
ing of the rocks, and great upheavals
of nature. About 6 B.c.

AND now it came to pass that “Sam-
uel, the Lamanite, did prophesy
a great many more things which
cannot be written.

2 And behold, he said unto them:
Behold, I give unto you a sign; for
“five years more cometh, and be-
hold, then cometh the Son of God
