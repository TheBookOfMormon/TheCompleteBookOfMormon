and immovable in keeping the
commandments of God, and they
bore with “patience the persecution
which was heaped upon them.

26 And when the priests left their
“labor to impart the word of God
unto the people, the people also left
their labors to hear the word of God.
And when the priest had imparted
unto them the word of God they
all returned again diligently unto
their labors; and the priest, not es-
teeming himself above his hearers,
for the preacher was no better than
the hearer, neither was the teacher
any better than the learner; and
thus they were all equal, and they
did all labor, every man according
to his strength.

27 And they did “impart of their
substance, every man according
to that which he had, to the ’poor,
and the needy, and the sick, and
the afflicted; and they did not wear
costly ‘apparel, yet they were neat
and comely.

28 And thus they did establish
the affairs of the church; and thus
they began to have continual peace
again, notwithstanding all their
persecutions.

29 And now, because of the steadi-
ness of the church they began to
be exceedingly “rich, having abun-
dance of all things whatsoever
they stood in need—an abundance
of flocks and herds, and fatlings of
every kind, and also abundance of
grain, and of gold, and of silver, and
of precious things, and abundance
of ’silk and fine-twined linen, and
all manner of good homely ‘cloth.

30 And thus, in their “prosperous

 

circumstances, they did not send
away any who were ’naked, or that
were hungry, or that were athirst,
or that were sick, or that had not
been nourished; and they did not
set their hearts upon ‘riches; there-
fore they were ‘liberal to all, both
old and young, both bond and free,
both male and female, whether
out of the church or in the church,
having no ‘respect to persons as to
those who stood in need.

31 And thus they did “prosper and
become far more wealthy than those
who did not belong to their church.

32 For those who did not belong
to their church did indulge them-
selves in “sorceries, and in *idolatry
or ‘idleness, and in “babblings, and
in ‘envyings and /strife; wearing
costly apparel; being ‘lifted up in
the pride of their own eyes; per-
secuting, lying, thieving, robbing,
committing whoredoms, and mur-
dering, and all manner of wicked-
ness; nevertheless, the law was put in
force upon all those who did trans-
gress it, inasmuch as it was possible.

33 And it came to pass that by
thus exercising the law upon them,
every man suffering according to
that which he had done, they became
more still, and durst not commit
any wickedness if it were known;
therefore, there was much peace
among the people of Nephi until the
fifth year of the reign of the judges.
