for me, yea, even that he hath heard
my prayer; yea, then do I remem-
ber his merciful arm which he ex-
tended towards me.

11 Yea, and I also remember the
captivity of my fathers; for I surely
do know that the “Lord did deliver
them out of bondage, and by this
did establish his church; yea, the
Lord God, the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob, did deliver them out of
bondage.

12 Yea, [have always remembered
the captivity of my fathers; and that
same God who “delivered them out
of the hands of the Egyptians did
deliver them out of bondage.

13 Yea, and that same God did es-
tablish his church among them; yea,
and that same God hath called me
by a “holy calling, to "preach the
word unto this people, and hath
given me much success, in the which
my joy is full.

14 But I do not joy in my own
“success alone, but my joy is more
full because of the success of my
brethren, who have been up to the
land of Nephi.

15 Behold, they have labored ex-
ceedingly, and have brought forth
much fruit; and how great shall be
their reward!

16 Now, when I think of the suc-
cess of these my brethren my soul
is carried away, even to the separa-
tion of it from the body, as it were,
sO great is my “joy.

17 And now may God grant unto
these, my brethren, that they may
sit down in the kingdom of God; yea,
and also all those who are the fruit
of their labors that they may go no
more out, but that they may praise
him forever. And may God grant
that it may be done according to
my words, even as I have spoken.
Amen.

 

CHAPTER 30

Korihor, the anti-Christ, ridicules Christ,
the Atonement, and the spirit of proph-
ecy—He teaches that there is no God, no
fall of man, no penalty for sin, and no
Christ—Alma testifies that Christ will
come and that all things denote there is
a God—Korihor demands a sign and is
struck dumb—The devil had appeared
to Korihor as an angel and taught him
what to say—Korihor is trodden down
and dies. About 76-74 B.c.

BEHOLD, now it came to pass that
after the “people of Ammon were
established in the land of Jershon,
yea, and also after the Lamanites
were *driven out of the land, and
their dead were buried by the peo-
ple of the land—

2 Now their dead were not num-
bered because of the greatness of
their numbers; neither were the dead
of the Nephites numbered—but it
came to pass after they had buried
their dead, and also after the days of
“fasting, and "mourning, and prayer,
(and it was in the sixteenth year of
the reign of the judges over the peo-
ple of Nephi) there began to be con-
tinual peace throughout all the land.

3 Yea, and the people did observe
to keep the commandments of the
Lord; and they were strict in ob-
serving the “ordinances of God,
according to the law of Moses; for
they were taught to ’keep the law
of Moses until it should be fulfilled.

4 And thus the people did have
no disturbance in all the sixteenth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi.

5 And it came to pass that in the
commencement of the seventeenth
year of the reign of the judges, there
was continual peace.

6 But it came to pass in the latter
end of the seventeenth year, there
came a man into the land of
