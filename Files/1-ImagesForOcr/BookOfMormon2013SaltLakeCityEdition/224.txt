upon himself his own condem-
nation.

20 Now it came to pass that not
many days after the battle which
was fought in the land of Zara-
hemla, by the Lamanites and the
Amilicites, that there was another
army of the Lamanites came in
upon the people of Nephi, in the
“same place where the first army
met the Amlicites.

21 And it came to pass that there
was an army sent to drive them out
of their land.

22 Now Alma himself being af-
flicted with a ‘wound did not go
up to battle at this time against the
Lamanites;

23 But he sent up a numerous army
against them; and they went up and
slew many of the Lamanites, and
drove the remainder of them out of
the borders of their land.

24 And then they returned again
and began to establish peace in the
land, being troubled no more fora
time with their enemies.

25 Now all these things were done,
yea, all these wars and contentions
were commenced and ended in
the fifth year of the reign of the
judges.

26 And in one year were thou-
sands and tens of thousands of souls
sent to the eternal world, that they
might reap their “rewards according
to their works, whether they were
good or whether they were bad, to
reap eternal happiness or eternal
misery, according to the spirit which
they listed to obey, whether it be a
good spirit or a bad one.

27 For every man receiveth ‘wages
of him whom he listeth to ’obey, and
this according to the words of the
spirit of prophecy; therefore let it
be according to the truth. And thus

 

endeth the fifth year of the reign
of the judges.

CHAPTER 4

Alma baptizes thousands of con-
verts—Iniquity enters the Church,
and the Church’s progress is hindered—
Nephihah is appointed chief judge—
Alma, as high priest, devotes himself to
the ministry. About 86-83 B.C.

Now it came to pass in the sixth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi, there were no
contentions nor wars in the “land
of Zarahemla;

2 But the people were afflicted,
yea, greatly afflicted for the loss of
their brethren, and also for the “loss
of their flocks and herds, and also
for the loss of their fields of grain,
which were trodden under foot and
destroyed by the Lamanites.

3 And so great were their afflic-
tions that every soul had cause to
mourn; and they believed that it
was the judgments of God sent upon
them because of their wickedness
and their abominations; therefore
they were “awakened to a remem-
brance of their duty.

4 And they began to establish the
“church more fully; yea, and many
were ’baptized in the ‘waters of Si-
don and were joined to the church
of God; yea, they were baptized by
the hand of Alma, who had been
consecrated the “high priest over
the people of the church, by the
hand of his father Alma.

5 And it came to pass in the seventh
year of the reign of the judges there
were about three thousand five hun-
dred souls that united themselves to
the “church of God and were baptized.
And thus ended the seventh year of
the reign of the judges over the people
