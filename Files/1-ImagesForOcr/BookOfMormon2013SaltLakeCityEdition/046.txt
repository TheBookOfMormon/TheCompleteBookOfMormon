of its much fruit and also wild honey;
and all these things were prepared
of the Lord that we might not per-
ish. And we beheld the sea, which
we called Irreantum, which, being
interpreted, is many waters.

6 And it came to pass that we did
pitch our tents by the seashore;
and notwithstanding we had suf-
fered many “afflictions and much
difficulty, yea, even so much that
we cannot write them all, we were
exceedingly rejoiced when we came
to the seashore; and we called the
place Bountiful, because of its much
fruit.

7 And it came to pass that after I,
Nephi, had been in the land of Boun-
tiful for the space of many days,
the voice of the Lord came unto
me, saying: “Arise, and get thee into
the mountain. And it came to pass
that I arose and went up into the
mountain, and cried unto the Lord.

8 And it came to pass that the Lord
spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt
“construct a ship, after the ’man-
ner which I shall show thee, that 1
may carry thy people across these
waters.

9 And I said: Lord, whither shall
I go that I may find ore to molten,
that I may make “tools to construct
the ship after the manner which
thou hast shown unto me?

10 And it came to pass that the
Lord told me whither I should go
to find ore, that I might make tools.

11 And it came to pass that I, Nephi,
did make a bellows wherewith to
“blow the fire, of the skins of beasts;
and after I had made a bellows, that
I might have wherewith to blow the

 

fire, [did smite two stones together
that | might make fire.

12 For the Lord had not hitherto
suffered that we should make much
fire, as we journeyed in the wilder-
ness; for he said: I will make thy
food become sweet, that ye *cook
it not;

13 And I will also be your light in
the wilderness; and I will prepare
the way before you, if it so be that
ye shall keep my commandments;
wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall
keep my commandments ye shall
be led towards the ’promised land;
and ye shall ‘know that it is by me
that ye are led.

14 Yea, and the Lord said also that:
After ye have arrived in the prom-
ised land, ye shall ¢know that I, the
Lord, am °God; and that I, the Lord,
did ‘deliver you from destruction;
yea, that I did bring you out of the
land of Jerusalem.

15 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did strive
to keep the “commandments of the
Lord, and I did "exhort my breth-
ren to faithfulness and diligence.

16 And it came to pass that I
did “make tools of the ore which
I did molten out of the rock.

17 And when my brethren saw
that I was about to “build a ship,
they began to ’murmur against me,
saying: Our brother is a fool, for he
thinketh that he can build a ship;
yea, and he also thinketh that he
can cross these great waters.

18 And thus my brethren did
“complain against me, and were
desirous that they might not labor,
for they did not *believe that I could
build a ship; neither would they
