“therefore it must needs be that he
must speak also to the Gentiles.

3 And all things that he spake have
been and “shall be, even according
to the words which he spake.

4 Therefore give heed to my words;
write the things which I have told
you; and according to the time and
the will of the Father “they shall go
forth unto the Gentiles.

5 And whosoever will hearken
unto my words and repenteth and
is baptized, the same shall be saved.
Search the “prophets, for many there
be that testify of these things.

6 And now it came to pass that
when Jesus had said these words he
said unto them again, after he had
expounded all the scriptures unto
them which they had received, he
said unto them: Behold, other scrip-
tures I would that ye should write,
that ye have not.

7 And it came to pass that he said
unto ‘Nephi: Bring forth the record
which ye have kept.

8 And when Nephi had brought
forth the records, and laid them
before him, he cast his eyes upon
them and said:

9 Verily I say unto you, I com-
manded my servant “Samuel, the
Lamanite, that he should testify
unto this people, that at the day
that the Father should glorify his
name in me that there were many
“saints who should ‘arise from the
dead, and should appear unto many,
and should minister unto them.
And he said unto them: Was it
not so?

10 And his disciples answered him.

be it that ye have not ‘written this

and appear unto many and did
minister unto them?

12 And it came to pass that Nephi
remembered that this thing had not

13 And it came to pass that Jesus
commanded that it should be ¢writ-

ing as he commanded.

14 And now it came to pass that
when Jesus had ‘expounded all the
scriptures in one, which they had
written, he commanded them that
they should teach the things which
he had expounded unto them.

CHAPTER 24

The Lord’s messenger will prepare the
way for the Second Coming—Christ will
sit in judgment—Israel is commanded
to pay tithes and offerings—A book of
remembrance is kept—Compare Mala-
chi 3. About A.D. 34.

AND it came to pass that he com-
manded them that they should
write the words which the Father
had given unto Malachi, which he
should tell unto them. And it came
to pass that after they were written
he expounded them. And these are
the words which he did tell unto
them, saying: Thus said the Father
unto Malachi—Behold, I will “send
my messenger, and he shall prepare
the way before me, and the Lord
whom ye seek shall suddenly ‘come
to his temple, even the “messenger
of the covenant, whom ye delight
in; behold, he shall come, saith the
Lord of Hosts.

2 But who may “abide the day of
