great as their strength, even man for
man. And thus had they fallen into
this great transgression; yea, thus
had they become “weak, because
of their transgression, in the space of
’not many years.

CHAPTER 5

Nephi and Lehi devote themselves to
preaching—Their names invite them to
pattern their lives after their forebears—
Christ redeems those who repent—
Nephi and Lehi make many converts
and are imprisoned, and fire encircles
them—A cloud of darkness overshad-
ows three hundred people—The earth
shakes, and a voice commands men to
repent—Nephi and Lehi converse with
angels, and the multitude is encircled
by fire. About 30 B.c.

AND it came to pass that in this same
year, behold, “Nephi *delivered up
the judgment-seat to a man whose
name was ‘Cezoram.

2 For as their laws and their gov-
ernments were established by the
“voice of the people, and they who
*chose evil were ‘more numerous
than they who chose good, therefore
they were “ripening for destruction,
for the laws had become corrupted.

3 Yea, and this was not all; they
were a “stiffnecked people, inso-
much that they could not be gov-
erned by the law nor justice, save
it were to their destruction.

4 And it came to pass that Nephi
had become weary because of their
iniquity; and he yielded up the
judgment-seat, and took it upon
him to preach the word of God all
the remainder of his days, and his
brother Lehi also, all the remain-
der of his days;

 

5 For they remembered the words
which their “father Helaman spake
unto them. And these are the words
which he spake:

6 Behold, my sons, I desire that
ye should remember to keep the
commandments of God; and I
would that ye should declare unto
the people these words. Behold, I
have given unto you the names of
our first “parents who came out
of the land of Jerusalem; and this
Ihave done that when you remem-
ber your names ye may remember
them; and when ye remember them
ye may remember their works; and
when ye remember their works ye
may know how that it is said, and
also written, that they were good.

7 Therefore, my sons, I would that
ye should do that which is good,
that it may be said of you, and also
written, even as it has been said and
written of them.

8 And now my sons, behold I have
somewhat more to desire of you,
which desire is, that ye may not
do these things that ye may boast,
but that ye may do these things to
lay up for yourselves a “treasure in
heaven, yea, which is eternal, and
which fadeth not away; yea, that
ye may have that "precious gift of
eternal life, which we have reason
to suppose hath been given to our
fathers.

9 Oremember, remember, my sons,
the “words which king Benjamin
spake unto his people; yea, remem-
ber that there is no other way nor
means whereby man can be saved,
only through the ’atoning blood
of Jesus Christ, who shall come;
yea, remember that he cometh to
“redeem the ‘world.
