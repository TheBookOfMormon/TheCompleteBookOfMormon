and cried unto them, saying: “Blessed
are ye if ye shall give heed unto the
words of these twelve whom I have
“chosen from among you to minis-
ter unto you, and to be your ser-
vants; and unto them I have given
power that they may baptize you
with water; and after that ye are
baptized with water, behold, I will
baptize you with fire and with the
Holy Ghost; therefore blessed are
ye if ye shall believe in me and be
baptized, after that ye have seen me
and know that I am.

2 And again, more blessed are they
who shall “believe in your words
because that ye shall testify that
ye have seen me, and that ye know
that Lam. Yea, blessed are they who
shall *believe in your ‘words, and
4¢come down into the depths of hu-
mility and be baptized, for they
shall be visited ‘with fire and with
the Holy Ghost, and shall receive a
remission of their sins.

3 Yea, blessed are the “poor in spirit
who "come unto me, for theirs is
the kingdom of heaven.

4 And again, blessed are all they that
“mourn, for they shall be comforted.

5 And blessed are the “meek, for
they shall inherit the earth.

6 And blessed are all they who
do “hunger and °thirst after ‘righ-
teousness, for they shall be “filled
with the Holy Ghost.

7 And blessed are the “merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy.

 

8 And blessed are all the “pure in
heart, for they shall *see God.

9 And blessed are all the ¢peace-
makers, for they shall be called the
*children of God.

10 And blessed are all they who
are “persecuted for my name’s sake,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

11 And blessed are ye when men
shall “revile you and persecute, and
shall say all manner of evil against
you falsely, for my sake;

12 For “ye shall have great joy and
be exceedingly glad, for great shall
be your *reward in heaven; for so
“persecuted they the prophets who
were before you.

13 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I
give unto you to be the “salt of the
earth; but if the salt shall lose its
savor wherewith shall the earth be
salted? The salt shall be thenceforth
good for nothing, but to be cast out
and to be trodden under foot of men.

14 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I
give unto you to be the light of this
people. A city that is set on a hill
cannot be hid.

15 Behold, do men light a “candle
and put it under a bushel? Nay, but
ona candlestick, and it giveth light
to all that are in the house;

16 Therefore let your “light so
shine before this people, that they
may see your good works and °glo-
rify your Father who is in heaven.

17 Think not that I am come to
destroy the law or the prophets.
