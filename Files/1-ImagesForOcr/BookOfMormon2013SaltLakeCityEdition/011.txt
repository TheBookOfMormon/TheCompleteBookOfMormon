with all his “heart, in behalf of his
people.

6 And it came to pass as he prayed
unto the Lord, there came a “pillar
of fire and dwelt upon a rock before
him; and he saw and heard much;
and because of the things which he
saw and heard he did *quake and
tremble exceedingly.

7 And it came to pass that he re-
turned to his own house at Jeru-
salem; and he cast himself upon
his bed, being “overcome with the
Spirit and the things which he had
seen.

8 And being thus overcome with
the Spirit, he was carried away
in a “vision, even that he saw the
*heavens open, and he thought he
“saw God sitting upon his throne,
surrounded with numberless con-
courses of angels in the attitude
of singing and praising their God.

9 And it came to pass that he saw
One descending out of the midst
of heaven, and he beheld that his
“luster was above that of the sun
at noon-day.

10 And he also saw “twelve others
following him, and their brightness
did exceed that of the stars in the
firmament.

11 And they came down and went
forth upon the face of the earth; and
the first came and “stood before my
father, and gave unto him a book,
and bade him that he should read.

12 And it came to pass that as he

 

read, he was filled with the “Spirit
of the Lord.

13 And he read, saying: Wo, wo,
unto Jerusalem, for I have seen
thine “abominations! Yea, and many
things did my father read concern-
ing *Jerusalem—that it should be
destroyed, and the inhabitants
thereof; many should perish by the
sword, and many should be ‘carried
away captive into Babylon.

14 And it came to pass that when
my father had read and seen many
great and marvelous things, he did
exclaim many things unto the Lord;
such as: Great and marvelous are
thy works, O Lord God Almighty!
Thy throne is high in the heavens,
and thy “power, and goodness, and
mercy are over all the inhabitants
of the earth; and, because thou art
merciful, thou wilt not suffer those
who ’come unto thee that they shall
perish!

15 And after this manner was
the language of my father in the
praising of his God; for his soul did
rejoice, and his whole heart was
filled, because of the things which
he had seen, yea, which the Lord
had shown unto him.

16 And now I, Nephi, do not make
a full account of the things which
my father hath written, for he hath
written many things which he saw
in ¢visions and in °dreams; and
he also hath written many things
which he ‘prophesied and spake
