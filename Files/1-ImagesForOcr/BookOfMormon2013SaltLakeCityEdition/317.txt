as one day with God, and time only
is measured unto men.

9 Therefore, there is a time ap-
pointed unto men that they shall
rise from the dead; and there is a
space between the time of death
and the resurrection. And now,
concerning this space of time, what
becometh of the souls of men is the
thing which I have inquired dili-
gently of the Lord to know; and
this is the thing of which I do know.

10 And when the time cometh
when all shall rise, then shall they
know that God “knoweth all the
*times which are appointed unto
man,

11 Now, concerning the “state of
the soul between *death and the
resurrection—Behold, it has been
made known unto me by an angel,
that the spirits of all men, as soon
as they are departed from this mor-
tal body, yea, the spirits of all men,
whether they be good or evil, are
‘taken “home to that God who gave
them life.

12 And then shall it come to pass,
that the spirits of those who are
righteous are received into a state
of “happiness, which is called
’paradise, a state of rest, a state of
“peace, where they shall rest from.
all their troubles and from all care,
and sorrow.

13 And then shall it come to pass,
that the “spirits of the wicked, yea,
who are evil—for behold, they have
no part nor portion of the Spirit of
the Lord; for behold, they chose evil
works rather than good; therefore

 

the spirit of the °devil did enter into
them, and take possession of their
house—and these shall be cast out
into ‘outer darkness; there shall be
“weeping, and wailing, and gnashing
of teeth, and this because of their
own iniquity, being led captive by
the will of the devil.

14 Now this is the state of the
4souls of the "wicked, yea, in dark-
ness, and a state of awful, ‘fearful
looking for the fiery ‘indignation of
the wrath of God upon them; thus
they remain in this ‘state, as well
as the righteous in paradise, until
the time of their resurrection.

15 Now, there are some that have
understood that this state of happi-
ness and this state of misery of the
soul, before the resurrection, was
a first resurrection. Yea, I admit it
may be termed a resurrection, the
“raising of the spirit or the soul and
their consignation to happiness
or misery, according to the words
which have been spoken.

16 And behold, again it hath been
spoken, that there is a “first *resur-
rection, a resurrection of all those
who have been, or who are, or who
shall be, down to the resurrection
of Christ from the dead.

17 Now, we do not suppose that
this first resurrection, which is spo-
ken of in this manner, can be the
resurrection of the souls and their
“consignation to happiness or mis-
ery. Ye cannot suppose that this is
what it meaneth.

18 Behold, I say unto you, Nay;
but it meaneth the “reuniting of the
