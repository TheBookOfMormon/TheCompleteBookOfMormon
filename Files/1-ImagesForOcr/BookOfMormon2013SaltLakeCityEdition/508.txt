land of “Moron where the king
dwelt, and took him captive, which
>brought to pass the saying of the
brother of Jared that they would
be brought into captivity.

6 Now the “land of Moron, where
the king dwelt, was near the land
which is called Desolation by the
Nephites.

7 And it came to pass that Kib
dwelt in ‘captivity, and his people
under Corihor his son, until he be-
came exceedingly old; nevertheless
Kib begat Shule in his old age, while
he was yet in captivity.

8 And it came to pass that Shule
was angry with his brother; and
Shule waxed strong, and became
mighty as to the strength of a man;
and he was also mighty in judgment.

9 Wherefore, he came to the hill
Ephraim, and he did molten out of
the hill, and made swords out of
steel for those whom he had drawn
away with him; and after he had
armed them with swords he returned
to the city Nehor, and gave battle
unto his brother Corihor, by which
means he obtained the kingdom
and restored it unto his father Kib.

10 And now because of the thing
which Shule had done, his father
bestowed upon him the kingdom;
therefore he began to reign in the
stead of his father.

11 And it came to pass that he did
execute judgment in righteousness;
and he did spread his kingdom upon
all the face of the land, for the people
had become exceedingly numerous.

12 And it came to pass that Shule
also begat many sons and daughters.

13 And Corihor repented of the
many evils which he had done;
wherefore Shule gave him power
in his kingdom.

14 And it came to pass that Corihor
had many sons and daughters. And
among the sons of Corihor there was
one whose name was Noah.

15 And it came to pass that Noah

 

rebelled against Shule, the king, and
also his father Corihor, and drew
away Cohor his brother, and also all
his brethren and many of the people.

16 And he gave battle unto Shule,
the king, in which he did obtain the
land of their “first inheritance; and
he became a king over that part of
the land.

17 And it came to pass that he gave
battle again unto Shule, the king;
and he took Shule, the king, and car-
ried him away captive into Moron.

18 And it came to pass as he was
about to put him to death, the sons
of Shule crept into the house of
Noah by night and slew him, and
broke down the door of the prison
and brought out their father, and
placed him upon his throne in his
own kingdom.

19 Wherefore, the son of Noah did
build up his kingdom in his stead;
nevertheless they did not gain power
any more over Shule the king, and
the people who were under the
reign of Shule the king did prosper
exceedingly and wax great.

20 And the country was @divided;
and there were two kingdoms, the
kingdom of Shule, and the kingdom
of Cohor, the son of Noah.

21 And Cohor, the son of Noah,
caused that his people should give
battle unto Shule, in which Shule
did beat them and did slay Cohor.

22 And now Cohor had a son who
was called Nimrod; and Nimrod
gave up the kingdom of Cohor unto
Shule, and he did gain favor in the
eyes of Shule; wherefore Shule did
bestow great favors upon him, and
he did do in the kingdom of Shule
according to his desires.

23 And also in the reign of Shule
there came “prophets among the peo-
ple, who were sent from the Lord,
prophesying that the wickedness and
idolatry of the people was bringing a
curse upon the land, and they should
be destroyed if they did not repent.
