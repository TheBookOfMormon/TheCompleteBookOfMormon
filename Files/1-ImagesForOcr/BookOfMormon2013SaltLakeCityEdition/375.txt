and contentions, and dissensions,
and all manner of iniquity among
the people of Nephi; nevertheless
for the ‘righteous’ sake, yea, because
of the prayers of the righteous, they
were spared.

41 But behold, because of the ex-
ceedingly great length of the war
between the Nephites and the La-
manites many had become hard-
ened, because of the exceedingly
great length of the war; and many
were softened because of their “af-
flictions, insomuch that they did
humble themselves before God, even
in the depth of humility.

42 And it came to pass that after
Moroni had fortified those parts of
the land which were most exposed
to the Lamanites, until they were
sufficiently strong, he returned to
the city of Zarahemla; and also He-
laman returned to the place of his
inheritance; and there was once
more peace established among the
people of Nephi.

43 And Moroni yielded up the
“command of his armies into the
hands of his son, whose name was
’Moronihah; and he retired to his
own house that he might spend the
remainder of his days in peace.

44 And Pahoran did return to his
judgment-seat; and Helaman did
take upon him again to preach unto
the people the word of God; for
because of so many wars and con-
tentions it had become expedient
that a “regulation should be made
again in the church.

45 Therefore, Helaman and his
brethren went forth, and did de-
clare the word of God with much
power unto the “convincing of many
people of their wickedness, which
did cause them to repent of their
sins and to be baptized unto the
Lord their God.

 

46 And it came to pass that they
did establish again the church of
God, throughout all the land.

47 Yea, and regulations were made
concerning the law. And their
“judges, and their chief judges were
chosen.

48 And the people of Nephi be-
gan to “prosper again in the land,
and began to multiply and to wax
exceedingly strong again in the
land. And they began to grow ex-
ceedingly rich.

49 But notwithstanding their
riches, or their strength, or their
prosperity, they were not lifted up
in the pride of their eyes; neither
were they “slow to remember the
Lord their God; but they did humble
themselves exceedingly before him.

50 Yea, they did remember how
great things the Lord had done for
them, that he had delivered them
from death, and from bonds, and
from prisons, and from all manner
of ‘afflictions, and he had ‘deliv-
ered them out of the hands of their
enemies.

51 And they did pray unto the
Lord their God continually, inso-
much that the Lord did bless them,
according to his word, so that they
did wax strong and “prosper in the
land.

52 And it came to pass that all
these things were done. And “He-
laman died, in the thirty and fifth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi.
