should be done among this people,
because of the hardness of their
hearts, and the deafness of their ears,
and the blindness of their minds,
and the “stiffness of their necks;
nevertheless, God is exceedingly
merciful unto them, and has not as
yet swept them off from the face
of the land.

4 And there are many among us
who have many ‘revelations, for
they are not all ’stiffnecked. And as
many as are not stiffnecked and
have faith, have ‘communion with
the Holy Spirit, which maketh mani-
fest unto the children of men, ac-
cording to their faith.

5 And now, behold, two hundred
years had passed away, and the
people of Nephi had waxed strong
in the land. They observed to “keep
the law of Moses and the *sabbath
day holy unto the Lord. And they
“profaned not; neither did they
4blaspheme. And the ‘laws of the
land were exceedingly strict.

6 And they were scattered upon
«much of the face of the land, and
the Lamanites also. And they were
exceedingly more *numerous than
were they of the Nephites; and they
loved ‘murder and would drink the
‘blood of beasts.

7 And it came to pass that they
came many times against us, the
Nephites, to battle. But our “kings
and our “leaders were mighty men
in the faith of the Lord; and they
taught the people the ways of the
Lord; wherefore, we withstood the
Lamanites and swept them away out

 

of ‘our lands, and began to fortify

8 And we multiplied exceedingly,
and spread upon the face of the
land, and became exceedingly rich
in “gold, and in silver, and in pre-
cious things, and in fine °workman-
ship of wood, in buildings, and in
‘machinery, and also in iron and
copper, and brass and steel, making
all manner of tools of every kind
to till the ground, and ‘weapons of
war—yea, the sharp pointed arrow,
and the quiver, and the dart, and
the javelin, and all preparations
for war.

9 And thus being prepared to meet
the Lamanites, they did not prosper
against us. But the word of the Lord
was verified, which he spake unto
our fathers, saying that: “Inasmuch
as ye will keep my commandments
ye shall prosper in the land.

10 And it came to pass that the
prophets of the Lord did threaten
the people of Nephi, according to
the word of God, that if they did
not keep the commandments, but
should fall into transgression, they
should be “destroyed from off the
face of the land.

11 Wherefore, the prophets, and
the priests, and the “teachers, did
labor diligently, exhorting with all
long-suffering the people to °dili-
