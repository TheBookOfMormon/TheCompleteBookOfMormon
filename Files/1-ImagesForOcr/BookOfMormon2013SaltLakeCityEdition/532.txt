25 Wherefore, by the ministering
of ‘angels, and by every word which
proceeded forth out of the mouth
of God, men began to exercise faith
in Christ; and thus by faith, they
did lay hold upon every good thing;
and thus it was until the coming
of Christ.

26 And after that he came men also
were “saved by faith in his name;
and by faith, they become the ’sons
of God. And as surely as Christ liv-
eth he spake these words unto our
fathers, saying: ‘Whatsoever thing
ye shall ask the Father in my name,
which is good, in faith believing that
ye shall receive, behold, it shall be
done unto you.

27 Wherefore, my beloved breth-
ren, have “miracles ceased because
Christ hath ascended into heaven,
and hath sat down on the right hand
of God, to *claim of the Father his
rights of mercy which he hath upon
the children of men?

28 For he hath answered the ends
of the law, and he claimeth all those
who have faith in him; and they who
have faith in him will ¢cleave unto
every good thing; wherefore he ’ad-
vocateth the cause of the children
of men; and he dwelleth eternally
in the heavens.

29 And because he hath done this,
my beloved brethren, have mira-
cles ceased? Behold I say unto you,
Nay; neither have “angels ceased to
minister unto the children of men.

30 For behold, they are subject
unto him, to minister according to
the word of his command, showing
themselves unto them of strong

 

faith and a firm mind in every form
of “godliness.

31 And the office of their minis-
try is to call men unto repentance,
and to fulfil and to do the work of
the covenants of the Father, which
he hath made unto the children of
men, to prepare the way among the
children of men, by declaring the
word of Christ unto the “chosen
vessels of the Lord, that they may
bear testimony of him.

32 And by so doing, the Lord God
prepareth the way that the ‘residue
of men may have *faith in Christ,
that the Holy Ghost may have place
in their hearts, according to the
power thereof; and after this man-
ner bringeth to pass the Father, the
covenants which he hath made unto
the children of men.

33 And Christ hath said: ‘If ye
will have *faith in me ye shall have
power to do whatsoever thing is
“expedient in me.

34 And he hath said: «Repent all
ye ends of the earth, and come unto
me, and be baptized in my name,
and have faith in me, that ye may
be saved.

35 And now, my beloved brethren,
if this be the case that these things
are true which I have spoken unto
you, and God will show unto you,
with “power and great glory at the
last °day, that they are true, and if
they are true has the day of mira-
cles ceased?

36 Or have angels ceased to appear
unto the children of men? Or has
he “withheld the power of the Holy
Ghost from them? Or will he, so
