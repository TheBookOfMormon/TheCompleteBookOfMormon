and prune them, and dung them
once more, for the last time, for
the end draweth nigh. And if it be
so that these last grafts shall grow,
and bring forth the natural fruit,
then shall ye prepare the way for
them, that they may grow.

65 And as they begin to grow
ye shall “clear away the branches
which bring forth bitter fruit, ac-
cording to the strength of the good
and the size thereof; and ye shall
not clear away the bad thereof all
at once, lest the roots thereof should
be too strong for the graft, and the
graft thereof shall perish, and I lose
the trees of my vineyard.

66 For it grieveth me that I should
lose the trees of my vineyard; where-
fore ye shall clear away the bad ac-
cording as the good shall grow, that
the root and the top may be equal
in strength, until the good shall
overcome the bad, and the bad be
hewn down and cast into the fire,
that they cumber not the ground of
my vineyard; and thus will | sweep
away the bad out of my vineyard.

67 And the branches of the nat-
ural tree will I graft in again into
the natural tree;

68 And the branches of the natu-
ral tree willl graft into the natural
branches of the tree; and thus will
I bring them together again, that
they shall bring forth the natural
“fruit, and they shall be one.

69 And the bad shall be “cast away,
yea, even out of all the land of my
vineyard; for behold, only this once
will | prune my vineyard.

70 And it came to pass that the
Lord of the vineyard sent his ¢ser-
vant; and the servant went and did
as the Lord had commanded him,
and brought other *servants; and
they were ‘few.

71 And the Lord of the vineyard

 

said unto them: Go to, and “labor
in the vineyard, with your might.
For behold, this is the "last time
that I shall ‘nourish my vineyard;
for the end is nigh at hand, and the
season speedily cometh; and if ye
labor with your might with me
ye shall have joy in the fruit which
I shall lay up unto myself against
the time which will soon come.

72 And it came to pass that the
servants did go and labor with their
mights; and the Lord of the vineyard
labored also with them; and they
did obey the commandments of the
Lord of the vineyard in all things.

73 And there began to be the natu-
ral fruit again in the vineyard; and
the natural branches began to grow
and thrive exceedingly; and the wild
branches began to be plucked off
and to be cast away; and they did
keep the root and the top thereof
equal, according to the strength
thereof.

74 And thus they labored, with
all diligence, according to the com-
mandments of the Lord of the vine-
yard, even until the bad had been
cast away out of the vineyard, and
the Lord had preserved unto himself
that the trees had become again the
natural fruit; and they became like
unto “one body; and the fruits were
equal; and the Lord of the vineyard
had preserved unto himself the natu-
ral fruit, which was most precious
unto him from the beginning.

75 And it came to pass that when
the “Lord of the vineyard saw that
his fruit was good, and that his
vineyard was no more corrupt, he
called up his servants, and said unto
them: Behold, for this last time have
we nourished my vineyard; and
thou beholdest that I have done
according to my will; and I have
preserved the natural fruit, that it
