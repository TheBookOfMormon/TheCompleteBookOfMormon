of his mind on account of his “wick-
edness, for he supposed that Alma
and Amulek were no more; and he
supposed that they had been slain
because of his iniquity. And this
great sin, and his many other sins,
did harrow up his mind until it did
become exceedingly sore, having no
deliverance; therefore he began to
be scorched with a burning heat.

4 Now, when he heard that Alma
and Amulek were in the land of Si-
dom, his heart began to take courage;
and he sent a message immediately
unto them, desiring them to come
unto him.

5 And it came to pass that they
went immediately, obeying the mes-
sage which he had sent unto them;
and they went in unto the house
unto Zeezrom; and they found him
upon his bed, sick, being very low
with a burning fever; and his mind
also was “exceedingly sore because
of his iniquities; and when he saw
them he stretched forth his hand,
and besought them that they would
heal him.

6 And it came to pass that Alma
said unto him, taking him by the
hand: “Believest thou in the power
of Christ unto salvation?

7 And he answered and said: Yea,
I believe all the words that thou
hast taught.

8 And Alma said: If thou believest
in the redemption of Christ thou
canst be “healed.

9 And he said: Yea, I believe ac-
cording to thy words.

10 And then Alma cried unto the
Lord, saying: O Lord our God, have
«mercy on this man, and “heal him
according to his faith which is in
Christ.

11 And when Alma had said these
words, *Zeezrom leaped upon his

 

feet, and began to walk; and this was
done to the great astonishment of
all the people; and the knowledge
of this went forth throughout all the
land of Sidom.

12 And Alma baptized Zeezrom
unto the Lord; and he began from
that time forth to preach unto the
people.

13 And Alma established a church
in the land of Sidom, and conse-
crated “priests and *teachers in the
land, to baptize unto the Lord who-
soever were desirous to be baptized.

14 And it came to pass that they
were many; for they did flock in
from all the region round about
Sidom, and were baptized.

15 But as to the people that were
in the land of Ammonihah, they yet
remained a hard-hearted and a stiff-
necked people; and they repented
not of their sins, “ascribing all the
power of Alma and Amulek to the
devil; for they were of the profes-
sion of ’Nehor, and did not believe
in the repentance of their sins.

16 And it came to pass that Alma
and Amulek, Amulek having “for-
saken all his gold, and silver, and
his precious things, which were in
the land of Ammonihah, for the
word of God, he being *rejected by
those who were once his friends and
also by his father and his kindred;

17 Therefore, after Alma having
established the church at Sidom,
seeing a great “check, yea, seeing
that the people were checked as to
the pride of their hearts, and began
to "humble themselves before God,
and began to assemble themselves
together at their ‘sanctuaries to “wor-
ship God before the “altar, ‘watching
and praying continually, that they
might be delivered from Satan, and
from ‘death, and from destruction—
