10 And Moroni also sent unto him,
desiring him that he would be “faith-
ful in maintaining that quarter of
the land, and that he would seek
every opportunity to scourge the
Lamanites in that quarter, as much
as was in his power, that perhaps he
might take again by stratagem or
some other way those cities which
had been taken out of their hands;
and that he also would fortify and
strengthen the cities round about,
which had not fallen into the hands
of the Lamanites.

11 And he also said unto him, I
would come unto you, but behold,
the Lamanites are upon us in the
borders of the land by the west
sea; and behold, I go against them,
therefore I cannot come unto you.

12 Now, the king (Ammoron) had
“departed out of the land of Zara-
hemla, and had made known unto
the queen concerning the death of
his brother, and had gathered to-
gether a large number of men, and
had marched forth against the Neph-
ites on the borders by the west sea.

13 And thus he was endeavoring
to harass the Nephites, and to draw
away a part of their forces to that
part of the land, while he had com-
manded those whom he had left
to possess the cities which he had
taken, that they should also harass
the Nephites on the borders by the
east sea, and should take possession
of their lands as much as it was in
their power, according to the power
of their armies.

14 And thus were the Nephites in
those dangerous circumstances in
the ending of the twenty and sixth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi.

15 But behold, it came to pass in
the twenty and seventh year of the
reign of the judges, that Teancum,
by the command of Moroni—who
had established armies to protect
the south and the west borders of
the land, and had begun his march

 

towards the land Bountiful, that
he might assist Teancum with his
men in retaking the cities which
they had lost—

16 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum had received orders to make
an attack upon the city of Mulek,
and retake it if it were possible.

17 And it came to pass that Tean-
cum made preparations to make an
attack upon the city of Mulek, and
march forth with his army against
the Lamanites; but he saw that it was
impossible that he could overpower
them while they were in their for-
tifications; therefore he abandoned
his designs and returned again to
the city Bountiful, to wait for the
coming of Moroni, that he might
receive strength to his army.

18 And it came to pass that Mo-
roni did arrive with his army at
the land of Bountiful, in the latter
end of the twenty and seventh year
of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

19 And in the commencement of
the twenty and eighth year, Mo-
roniand Teancum and many of the
chief “captains held a council of
war—what they should do to cause
the Lamanites to come out against
them to battle; or that they might
by some means flatter them out of
their strongholds, that they might
gain advantage over them and take
again the city of Mulek.

20 And it came to pass they sent
embassies to the army of the La-
manites, which protected the city
of Mulek, to their leader, whose
name was Jacob, desiring him that
he would come out with his armies
to meet them upon the plains be-
tween the two cities. But behold,
Jacob, who was a “Zoramite, would
not come out with his army to meet
them upon the plains.

21 And it came to pass that Moroni,
having no hopes of meeting them
upon fair grounds, therefore, he re-
solved upon a plan that he might
