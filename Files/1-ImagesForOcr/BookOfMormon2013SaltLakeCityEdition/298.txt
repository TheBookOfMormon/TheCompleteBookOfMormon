13 And now, because ye are com-
pelled to be humble blessed are ye;
for a man sometimes, if he is com-
pelled to be humble, seeketh “repen-
tance; and now surely, whosoever
repenteth shall find mercy; and he
that findeth mercy and *endureth
to the end the same shall be saved.

14 And now, as I said unto you,
that because ye were compelled
to be “humble ye were blessed, do
ye not suppose that they are more
blessed who truly humble them-
selves because of the word?

15 Yea, he that truly humbleth
himself, and repenteth of his sins,
and endureth to the end, the same
shall be blessed—yea, much more
blessed than they who are com-
pelled to be humble because of
their exceeding poverty.

16 Therefore, blessed are they who
“humble themselves without being
*’compelled to be humble; or rather,
in other words, blessed is he that
believeth in the word of God, and is
baptized without ‘stubbornness of
heart, yea, without being brought to
know the word, or even compelled
to know, before they will believe.

17 Yea, there are many who do say:
If thou wilt show unto us a “sign
from heaven, then we shall know
of a surety; then we shall believe.

18 Now Lask, is this faith? Behold,
I say unto you, Nay; for if a man
knoweth a thing he hath no cause
to “believe, for he knoweth it.

19 And now, how much “more
*cursed is he that “knoweth the
4will of God and doeth it not, than
he that only believeth, or only hath
cause to believe, and falleth into
“transgression?

20 Now of this thing ye must judge.

 

Behold, I say unto you, that it is on
the one hand even as it is on the
other; and it shall be unto every
man according to his work.

21 And now as I said concerning
faith—‘faith is not to have a per-
fect knowledge of things; therefore
if ye have faith ye *hope for things
which are ‘not seen, which are true.

22 And now, behold, I say unto
you, and I would that ye should re-
member, that God is ‘merciful unto
all who believe on his name; there-
fore he desireth, in the first place,
that ye should believe, yea, even
on his word.

23 And now, he imparteth his word
by angels unto men, yea, “not only
men but women also. Now this is not
all; little "children do have words
given unto them many times, which
“confound the wise and the learned.

24 And now, my beloved brethren,
as ye have desired to know of me
what ye shall do because ye are af-
flicted and cast out—now I do not
desire that ye should suppose that
I mean to judge you only according
to that which is true—

25 For I do not mean that ye all of
you have been compelled to hum-
ble yourselves; for I verily believe
that there are some among you who
«would humble themselves, let them
be in whatsoever circumstances
they might.

26 Now, as I said concerning faith—
that it was not a perfect knowl-
edge—even so it is with my words.
Ye cannot know of their surety at
first, unto perfection, any more
than faith is a perfect knowledge.

27 But behold, if ye will awake
and arouse your faculties, even to
an experiment upon my words, and
