the persecutions which were heaped
upon them by the remainder of his
people, and seeing all their ¢in-
equality, began to be very sorrow-
ful; nevertheless the Spirit of the
Lord did not fail him.

16 And he selected a wise man
who was among the elders of the
church, and gave him power ac-
cording to the *voice of the people,
that he might have power to enact
‘laws according to the laws which
had been given, and to put themin
force according to the wickedness
and the crimes of the people.

17 Now this man’s name was
¢Nephihah, and he was appointed
’chief judge; and he sat in the
judgment-seat to judge and to gov-
ern the people.

18 Now Alma did not grant unto
him the office of being “high priest
over the church, but he retained the
office of high priest unto himself;
but he delivered the judgment-seat
unto *Nephihah.

19 And this he did that he “himself
might go forth among his people,
or among the people of Nephi, that
he might °preach the ‘word of God
unto them, to 4stir them up in ‘re-
membrance of their duty, and that
he might pull down, by the word
of God, all the pride and craftiness
and all the contentions which were
among his people, seeing no way
that he might reclaim them save it
were in bearing down in pure ‘tes-
timony against them.

20 And thus in the commencement
of the ninth year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi,
Alma delivered up the judgment-seat
to “Nephihah, and confined himself

 

wholly to the °high priesthood of
the holy order of God, to the ‘testi-
mony of the word, according to the
spirit of revelation and prophecy.

The words which Alma, the High
Priest according to the holy order
of God, delivered to the people in
their cities and villages throughout
the land.

Beginning with chapter 5.

CHAPTER 5

To gain salvation, men must repent
and keep the commandments, be born
again, cleanse their garments through
the blood of Christ, be humble and strip
themselves of pride and envy, and do
the works of righteousness—The Good
Shepherd calls His people—Those who
do evil works are children of the devil—
Alma testifies of the truth of his doctrine
and commands men to repent—The
names of the righteous will be written
in the book of life. About 83 B.c.

Now it came to pass that Alma be-
gan to “deliver the word of °God
unto the people, first in the land
of Zarahemla, and from thence
throughout all the land.

2 And these are the words which
he spake to the people in the church
which was established in the city
of Zarahemla, according to his own
record, saying:

31, Alma, having been “conse-
crated by my father, Alma, to be a
*high priest over the church of God,
he having power and ‘authority
from God to do these things, be-
hold, I say unto you that he began to
