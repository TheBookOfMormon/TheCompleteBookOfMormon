people of Nephi) that the chief
judge over the land of “Ammoni-
hah and many of their teachers
and their lawyers went in unto the
prison where Alma and Amulek
were bound with cords.

24 And the chief judge stood be-
fore them, and smote them again,
and said unto them: If ye have the
“power of God deliver yourselves
from these bands, and then we will
believe that the Lord will destroy
this people according to your words.

25 And it came to pass that they all
went forth and smote them, saying
the same words, even until the last;
and when the last had spoken unto
them the “power of God was upon
Alma and Amulek, and they rose
and stood upon their feet.

26 And Alma cried, saying: How
long shall we suffer these great
“afflictions, O Lord? O Lord, °give
us strength according to our faith
which is in Christ, even unto ‘de-
liverance. And they broke the cords
with which they were bound; and
when the people saw this, they be-
gan to flee, for the fear of destruc-
tion had come upon them.

27 And it came to pass that so great
was their fear that they fell to the
earth, and did not obtain the outer
door of the “prison; and the earth
shook mightily, and the walls of
the prison were rent in twain, so
that they fell to the earth; and the
chief judge, and the lawyers, and
priests, and teachers, who smote
upon Alma and Amulek, were slain
by the fall thereof.

28 And Alma and Amulek came
forth out of the prison, and they
were not hurt; for the Lord had
granted unto them “power, accord-
ing to their faith which was in Christ.

 

And they straightway came forth
out of the prison; and they were
*loosed from their ‘bands; and the
prison had fallen to the earth, and
every soul within the walls thereof,
save it were Alma and Amulek, was
slain; and they straightway came
forth into the city.

29 Now the people having heard a
great noise came running together by
multitudes to know the cause of it;
and when they saw Alma and Amu-
lek coming forth out of the prison,
and the walls thereof had fallen to
the earth, they were struck with
great fear, and fled from the pres-
ence of Alma and Amulek even as a
goat fleeth with her young from two
lions; and thus they did flee from
the presence of Alma and Amulek.

CHAPTER 15

Alma and Amulek go to Sidom and
establish a church—Alma heals Zeez-
rom, who joins the Church—Many are
baptized, and the Church prospers—
Alma and Amulek go to Zarahemla.
About 81 B.C.

AND it came to pass that Alma and
Amulek were commanded to depart
out of that city; and they departed,
and came out even into the land of
Sidom; and behold, there they found
all the people who had departed out
of the land of “Ammonihah, who had
been ’cast out and stoned, because
they believed in the words of Alma.

2 And they related unto them all
that had happened unto their “wives
and children, and also concerning
themselves, and of their *power of
deliverance.

3 And also Zeezrom lay sick at Si-
dom, with a burning fever, which
was caused by the great tribulations
