the borders of the land which was by
the wilderness side. And they were
baptized throughout all the land;

6 So that when he had finished his
work at Melek he departed thence,
and traveled three days’ journey on
the north of the land of Melek; and
he came to a city which was called
«Ammonihah.

7 Now it was the custom of the
people of Nephi to call their lands,
and their cities, and their villages,
yea, even all their small villages, af-
ter the ‘name of him who first pos-
sessed them; and thus it was with
the land of Ammonihah.

8 And it came to pass that when
Alma had come to the city of Am-
monihah he began to preach the
word of God unto them.

9 Now Satan had gotten great “hold
upon the hearts of the people of the
city of Ammonihah; therefore they
would not hearken unto the words
of Alma.

10 Nevertheless Alma “labored
much in the spirit, ‘wrestling with
God in ‘mighty prayer, that he
would pour out his Spirit upon the
people who were in the city; that
he would also grant that he might
baptize them unto repentance.

11 Nevertheless, they hardened
their hearts, saying unto him: Behold,
we know that thou art Alma; and we
know that thou art high priest over
the church which thou hast estab-
lished in many parts of the land,
according to your tradition; and we
are not of thy church, and we do not
believe in such foolish traditions.

12 And now we know that because
we are not of thy church we know
that thou hast no power over us; and
thou hast delivered up the judgment-
seat unto “Nephihah; therefore thou
art not the chief judge over us.

 

13 Now when the people had said
this, and withstood all his words,
and “reviled him, and spit upon
him, and caused that he should be
’cast out of their city, he departed
thence and took his journey towards
the city which was called Aaron.

14 And it came to pass that while
he was journeying thither, being
weighed down with sorrow, wading
through much “tribulation and an-
guish of soul, because of the wicked-
ness of the people who were in the
city of Ammonihah, it came to pass
while Alma was thus weighed down
with sorrow, behold an *angel of the
Lord appeared unto him, saying:

15 Blessed art thou, Alma; there-
fore, lift up thy head and rejoice, for
thou hast great cause to rejoice;
for thou hast been faithful in keep-
ing the commandments of God from
the time which thou receivedst thy
first message from him. Behold, I
am he that “delivered it unto you.

16 And behold, I am sent to ¢com-
mand thee that thou return to the
city of Ammonihah, and preach
again unto the people of the city;
yea, preach unto them. Yea, say unto
them, except they repent the Lord
God will *destroy them.

17 For behold, they do study at
this time that they may destroy
the liberty of thy people, (for thus
saith the Lord) which is contrary to
the “statutes, and judgments, and
commandments which he has given
unto his people.

18 Now it came to pass that after
Alma had received his message from.
the angel of the Lord he returned
speedily to the land of Ammonihah.
And he entered the city by another
way, yea, by the way which is on
the south of the city of Ammonihah.

19 And as “he entered the city he
