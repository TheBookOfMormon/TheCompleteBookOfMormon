14 Yet the Lord God saw that his
people were a “stiffnecked people,
and he appointed unto them a “law,
even the ‘law of Moses.

15 And many signs, and wonders,
and “types, and shadows showed he
unto them, concerning his coming;
and also holy prophets spake unto
them concerning his coming; and
yet they “hardened their hearts,
and understood not that the ‘law
of Moses availeth nothing “except
it were through the ‘atonement of
his blood.

16 And even if it were possible
that little “children could sin they
could not be saved; but I say unto
you they are blessed; for behold,
as in Adam, or by nature, they fall,
even so the blood of Christ ‘atoneth
for their sins.

17 And moreover, I say unto you,
that there shall be ‘no other name
given nor any other way nor means
whereby ’salvation can come unto
the children of men, only in and
through the name of Christ, the
“Lord Omnipotent.

18 For behold he judgeth, and
his judgment is just; and the in-

4atoning blood of Christ, the Lord
Omnipotent.

19 For the ‘natural ’man is an
“enemy to God, and has been from
the “fall of Adam, and will be, for-
ever and ever, unless he ‘yields to
the enticings of the ‘Holy Spirit,
and ‘putteth off the "natural man
and becometh a ‘saint through the
atonement of Christ the Lord, and
becometh as a ichild, ‘submissive,
meek, humble, patient, full of love,
willing to submit to all things which
the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon
him, even as a child doth submit
to his father.

20 And moreover, I say unto you,
that the time shall come when the
“knowledge of a ’Savior shall spread
throughout ‘every nation, kindred,
tongue, and people.

21 And behold, when that time
cometh, none shall be found “blame-
less before God, except it be little
children, only through repentance
and faith on the name of the Lord
God Omnipotent.

22 And even at this time, when
thou shalt have taught thy people
the things which the Lord thy God
hath commanded thee, even then
