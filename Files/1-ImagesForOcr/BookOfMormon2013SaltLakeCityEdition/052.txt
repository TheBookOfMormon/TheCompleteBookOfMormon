threatenings against anyone that
should speak for me; and my parents
being *stricken in years, and having
‘suffered much grief because of their
4children, they were brought down,
yea, even upon their sick-beds.

18 Because of their grief and much
sorrow, and the iniquity of my
brethren, they were brought near
even to be carried out of this time
to meet their God; yea, their “grey
hairs were about to be brought down
to lie low in the dust; yea, even they
were near to be cast with sorrow
into a watery grave.

19 And Jacob and Joseph also, be-
ing young, having need of much
nourishment, were grieved because
of the afflictions of their mother;
and also“my wife with her tears and
prayers, and also my children, did
not soften the hearts of my breth-
ren that they would loose me.

20 And there was nothing save
it were the power of God, which
threatened them with destruction,
could soften their “hearts; where-
fore, when they saw that they were
about to be swallowed up in the
depths of the sea they repented of
the thing which they had done, in-
somuch that they loosed me.

21 And it came to pass after they
had loosed me, behold, I took the
compass, and it did work whither I
desired it. And it came to pass that
1¢prayed unto the Lord; and after
I had prayed the winds did cease,
and the storm did cease, and there
was a great calm.

22 And it came to pass that I,
Nephi, did guide the ship, that we
sailed again towards the promised
land.

23 And it came to pass that after
we had sailed for the space of many
days we did arrive at the “promised

 

land; and we went forth upon the
land, and did pitch our tents; and
we did call it the promised land.
24 And it came to pass that we did
begin to till the earth, and we be-
gan to plant seeds; yea, we did put
all our “seeds into the earth, which
we had brought from the land of
Jerusalem. And it came to pass that
they did grow exceedingly; where-
fore, we were blessed in abundance.
25 And it came to pass that we did
find upon the land of promise, as
we journeyed in the wilderness, that
there were “beasts in the forests of
every kind, both the cow and the
ox, and the ass and the horse, and
the goat and the wild goat, and all
manner of wild animals, which
were for the use of men. And we
did find all manner of ore, both of
“gold, and of silver, and of copper.

CHAPTER 19

Nephi makes plates of ore and records
the history of his people—The God
of Israel will come six hundred years
from the time Lehi left Jerusalem—
Nephi tells of His sufferings and
crucifixion—The Jews will be despised
and scattered until the latter days, when
they will return unto the Lord. About
588-570 B.C.

AND it came to pass that the Lord
commanded me, wherefore I did
make plates of ore that I might
engraven upon them the “record
of my people. And upon the plates
which I made I did *engraven the
record of my ‘father, and also our
journeyings in the wilderness, and
the prophecies of my father; and
also many of mine own prophecies
have I engraven upon them.

2 And I knew not at the time
when I made them that I should be
