Lord God will proceed to do a “mar-
velous work among the °Gentiles,
which shall be of great ‘worth unto
our seed; wherefore, it is likened
unto their being nourished by the
4Gentiles and being carried in their
arms and upon their shoulders.

9 And it shall also be of “worth
unto the Gentiles; and not only unto
the Gentiles but °unto all the Shouse
of Israel, unto the making known
of the “covenants of the Father of
heaven unto Abraham, saying: In
thy ‘seed shall all the kindreds of
the earth be ‘blessed.

10 And I would, my brethren, that
ye should know that all the kindreds
of the earth cannot be blessed un-
less he shall make “bare his arm in
the eyes of the nations.

11 Wherefore, the Lord God will
proceed to make bare his arm in the
eyes of all the ‘nations, in bringing
about his covenants and his gospel
unto those who are of the house
of Israel.

12 Wherefore, he will “bring them.
again out of ‘captivity, and they
shall be ‘gathered together to the
lands of their ‘inheritance; and
they shall be ‘brought out of ob-
scurity and out of ‘darkness; and
they shall know that the ‘Lord is

 

their "Savior and their Redeemer,
the ‘Mighty One of Israel.

13 And the blood of that great and
“abominable church, which is the
whore of all the earth, shall turn
upon their own heads; for they shall
war among themselves, and the
sword of their ‘own hands shall fall
upon their own heads, and they shall
be drunken with their own blood.

14 And every “nation which shall
war against thee, O house of Israel,
shall be turned one against an-
other, and they shall *fall into the
pit which they digged to ensnare
the people of the Lord. And all that
‘fight against Zion shall be de-
stroyed, and that great whore, who
hath perverted the right ways of
the Lord, yea, that great and abomi-
nable church, shall tumble to the
4qust and great shall be the fall of it.

15 For behold, saith the prophet,
the time cometh speedily that Sa-
tan shall have no more power over
the hearts of the children of men;
for the day soon cometh that all the
proud and they who do wickedly
shall be as “stubble; and the day
cometh that they must be °burned.

16 For the time soon cometh that
the fulness of the ‘wrath of God shall
be poured out upon all the children
