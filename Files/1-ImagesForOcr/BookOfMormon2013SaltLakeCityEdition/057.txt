Lord hath redeemed his ‘servant
Jacob.

21 And they “thirsted not; he led
them through the deserts; he caused
the waters to flow out of the *rock
for them; he clave the rock also and
the waters gushed out.

22 And notwithstanding he hath
done all this, and greater also, there
is no “peace, saith the Lord, unto
the wicked.

CHAPTER 21

The Messiah will be a light to the Gentiles
and will free the prisoners—Israel will
be gathered with power in the last days—
Kings will be their nursing fathers—
Compare Isaiah 49. About 588-570 B.c.

“AND again: Hearken, O ye house
of Israel, all ye that are broken off.
and are driven out because of the
wickedness of the pastors of my
people; yea, all ye that are broken
off, that are scattered abroad, who
are of my people, O house of Is-
rael. Listen, O "isles, unto me, and
hearken ye people from ‘far; the
Lord hath called me from the womb;
from the bowels of my mother hath
he made mention of my name.

2 And he hath made my mouth
like a sharp sword; in the shadow of
his hand hath he hid me, and made
me a polished shaft; in his quiver
hath he hid me;

3 And said unto me: Thou art my
“servant, O Israel, in whom I will
be glorified.

4 Then I said, I have labored in
“vain, I have spent my strength
for naught and in vain; surely my
judgment is with the Lord, and my
work with my God.

 

5 And now, saith the Lord—that
“formed me from the womb that I
should be his servant, to bring Jacob
again to him—though Israel be not
gathered, yet shall I be glorious in
the eyes of the Lord, and my God
shall be my °strength.

6 And he said: It is a light thing
that thou shouldst be my servant
to raise up the “tribes of Jacob, and
to restore the preserved of Israel. I
will also give thee for a “light to the
“Gentiles, that thou mayest be my
salvation unto the ends of the earth.

7 Thus saith the Lord, the Re-
deemer of Israel, his Holy One, to
him whom man despiseth, to him
whom the nations abhorreth, to ser-
vant of rulers: Kings shall see and
arise, princes also shall worship,
because of the Lord that is faithful.

8 Thus saith the Lord: In an accept-
able time have I heard thee, O isles
of the sea, and in a day of salvation
have I helped thee; and I will pre-
serve thee, and give thee “my ser-
vant for a covenant of the people,
to establish the earth, to cause to
inherit the desolate heritages;

9 That thou mayest say to the
4prisoners: Go forth; to them that
sit in °darkness: Show yourselves.
They shall feed in the ways, and
their ‘pastures shall be in all high
places.

10 They shall not hunger nor thirst,
neither shall the heat nor the sun
smite them; for he that hath mercy
on them shall lead them, even by
the springs of water shall he guide
them.

11 And I will make all my moun-
tains a way, and my “highways shall
be exalted.
