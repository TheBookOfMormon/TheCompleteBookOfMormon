brought and be arraigned before the
bar of Christ the Son, and God the
*Father, and the Holy Spirit, which
is ‘one Eternal God, to be “judged
according to their works, whether
they be good or whether they be
evil.

45 Now, behold, I have spoken
unto you concerning the “death of
the mortal body, and also concern-
ing the resurrection of the mortal
body. I say unto you that this mor-
tal body is ‘raised to an “immortal
body, that is from death, even from
the first death unto life, that they
can ‘die no more; their spirits unit-
ing with their bodies, never to be
divided; thus the whole becoming
spiritual and immortal, that they
can no more see corruption.

46 Now, when Amulek had finished
these words the people began again
to be astonished, and also Zeezrom
began to tremble. And thus ended
the words of Amulek, or this is all
that I have written.

CHAPTER 12

Alma speaks to Zeezrom—The mysteries
of God can be given only to the faith-
ful—Men are judged by their thoughts,
beliefs, words, and works—The wicked
will suffer a spiritual death—This mor-
tal life is a probationary state—The
plan of redemption brings to pass the
Resurrection and, through faith, a re-
mission of sins—The repentant have a
claim on mercy through the Only Be-
gotten Son. About 82 B.c.

Now Alma, seeing that the words of
Amulek had silenced Zeezrom, for
he beheld that Amulek had caught
him in his “lying and deceiving to de-
stroy him, and seeing that he began
to tremble under a ’consciousness

 

of his guilt, he opened his mouth
and began to speak unto him, and
to establish the words of Amulek,
and to explain things beyond, or to
unfold the scriptures beyond that
which Amulek had done.

2 Now the words that Alma spake
unto Zeezrom were heard by the
people round about; for the mul-
titude was great, and he spake on
this wise:

3 Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou
hast been taken in thy lying and
craftiness, for thou hast not lied
unto men only but thou hast lied
unto God; for behold, he knows all
thy “thoughts, and thou seest that
thy ‘thoughts are made known unto
us by his Spirit;

4 And thou seest that we know
that thy plan was a very “subtle
plan, as to the subtlety of the devil,
for to lie and to deceive this peo-
ple that thou mightest set them
against us, to ’revile us and to cast
us out—

5 Now this was a plan of thine “ad-
versary, and he hath exercised his
power in thee. Now I would that ye
should remember that what I say
unto thee I say unto all.

6 And behold I say unto you all
that this was a “snare of the adver-
sary, which he has laid to catch
this people, that he might bring
you into subjection unto him, that
he might encircle you about with
his *chains, that he might chain
you down to everlasting destruc-
tion, according to the power of his
captivity.

7 Now when Alma had spoken
these words, Zeezrom began to
tremble more exceedingly, for he
was convinced more and more of
the power of God; and he was also
