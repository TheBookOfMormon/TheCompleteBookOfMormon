in the days of Coriantumr, and be-
gan to prophesy unto the people,
for he could not be *restrained
because of the Spirit of the Lord
which was in him.

3 For he did “cry from the ’morn-
ing, even until the going down of
the sun, exhorting the people to
believe in God unto repentance lest
they should be ‘destroyed, saying
unto them that “by ‘faith all things
are fulfilled—

4 Wherefore, whoso believeth in
God might with “surety *hope for
a better world, yea, even a place at
the right hand of God, which Shope
cometh of “faith, maketh an ‘anchor
to the souls of men, which would
make them sure and steadfast, al-
ways abounding in ‘good works,
being led to “glorify God.

5 And it came to pass that Ether
did prophesy great and marvelous
things unto the people, which they
did not believe, because they ‘saw
them not.

6 And now, I, Moroni, would speak
somewhat concerning these things;
I would show unto the world that
“faith is things which are "hoped

and he showed not himself unto

if ye will but have faith.

10 Behold it was by faith that they
of old were “called after the holy
order of God.

11 Wherefore, by faith was the law
of Moses given. But in the “gift of
his Son hath God prepared a more
’excellent way; and it is by faith
that it hath been fulfilled.

12 For if there be no “faith among
the children of men God can do no
’miracle among them; wherefore,
he showed not himself until after
their faith.

13 Behold, it was the faith of Alma
and Amulek that caused the “prison
to tumble to the earth.

14 Behold, it was the faith of
Nephi and Lehi that wrought the
“change upon the Lamanites, that
they were baptized with fire and
with the Holy Ghost.

15 Behold, it was the faith of
sAmmon and his brethren which
’wrought so great a miracle among
