shall *minister unto him and shall
pray for him unto the Father, in
my name; and if it so be that he re-
penteth and is baptized in my name,
then shall ye receive him, and shall
minister unto him of my flesh and
blood.

31 But if he repent not he shall
not be numbered among my people,
that he may not destroy my people,
for behold I “know *my sheep, and
they are numbered.

32 Nevertheless, ye shall not cast
him out of your “synagogues, or
your places of worship, for unto
such shall ye continue to minister;
for ye know not but what they will
return and repent, and come unto
me with full purpose of heart, and
I shall "heal them; and ye shall be
the means of bringing salvation
unto them.

33 Therefore, keep these sayings
which I have commanded you that
ye come not under ¢condemnation;
for wo unto him whom the Father
condemneth.

34 And I give you these command-
ments because of the disputations
which have been among you. And
blessed are ye if ye have “no dispu-
tations among you.

35 And now I go unto the Father,
because it is expedient that I should
go unto the Father “for your sakes.

36 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had made an end of these say-
ings, he touched with his “hand the
’disciples whom he had chosen, one
by one, even until he had touched
them all, and spake unto them as
he touched them.

37 And the multitude heard not
the words which he spake, therefore
they did not bear record; but the
disciples bare record that he gave

 

them “power to give the "Holy Ghost.
And I will show unto you ‘hereafter
that this record is true.

38 And it came to pass that when
Jesus had touched them all, there
came a “cloud and overshadowed
the multitude that they could not
see Jesus.

39 And while they were overshad-
owed he “departed from them, and
ascended into heaven. And the dis-
ciples saw and did bear record that
he ascended again into heaven.

CHAPTER 19

The twelve disciples minister unto the
people and pray for the Holy Ghost—
The disciples are baptized and receive
the Holy Ghost and the ministering of
angels—Jesus prays using words that
cannot be written—He attests to the
exceedingly great faith of these Neph-
ites. About A.D. 34.

AND now it came to pass that when
Jesus had ascended into heaven,
the multitude did disperse, and
every man did take his wife and his
children and did return to his own
home.

2 And it was noised abroad among
the people immediately, before it
was yet dark, that the multitude had
seen Jesus, and that he had minis-
tered unto them, and that he would
also show himself on the “morrow
unto the multitude.

3 Yea, and even all the night it was
noised abroad concerning Jesus; and
insomuch did they send forth unto
the people that there were many,
yea, an exceedingly great number,
did labor exceedingly all that night,
that they might be on the morrow in
the place where Jesus should show
himself unto the multitude.
