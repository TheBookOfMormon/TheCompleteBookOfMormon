easiness and *willingness to believe
in his words.

37 And it came to pass that the
Lamanites did hunt the band of
robbers of Gadianton; and they
did preach the word of God among
the more wicked part of them, in-
somuch that this band of robbers
was utterly destroyed from among
the Lamanites.

38 And it came to pass on the
other hand, that the Nephites did
build them up and support them,
beginning at the more wicked part
of them, until they had overspread
all the land of the Nephites, and
had seduced the more part of the
righteous until they had come down
to believe in their works and par-
take of their spoils, and to join with
them in their secret murders and
combinations.

39 And thus they did obtain the
sole management of the govern-
ment, insomuch that they did tram-
ple under their feet and smite and
rend and turn their backs upon the
“poor and the meek, and the hum-
ble followers of God.

40 And thus we see that they were
in an awful state, and “ripening for
an everlasting destruction.

41 And it came to pass that thus
ended the sixty and eighth year
of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

THE PROPHECY OF NEPHI, THE SON OF
HELAMAN—GOd threatens the people
of Nephi that he will visit them in
his anger, to their utter destruction
except they repent of their wick-
edness. God smiteth the people of
Nephi with pestilence; they repent
and turn unto him. Samuel, a Laman-
ite, prophesies unto the Nephites.

Comprising chapters 7 through 16.

 

CHAPTER 7

Nephi is rejected in the north and returns
to Zarahemla—He prays upon his gar-
den tower and then calls upon the people
to repent or perish. About 23-21 B.c.

BEHOLD, now it came to pass in the
sixty and ninth year of the reign of
the judges over the people of the
Nephites, that Nephi, the son of
Helaman, “returned to the land of
Zarahemia from the land northward.

2 For he had been forth among the
people who were in the land north-
ward, and did preach the word of
God unto them, and did prophesy
many things unto them;

3 And they did “reject all his words,
insomuch that he could not stay
among them, but returned again
unto the land of his nativity.

4 And seeing the people ina state
of such awful wickedness, and
those Gadianton robbers filling the
judgment-seats—having “usurped
the power and authority of the land;
laying aside the commandments
of God, and not in the least aright
before him; doing no justice unto
the children of men;

5 Condemning the righteous be-
cause of their righteousness; letting
the guilty and the wicked go “un-
punished because of their *money;
and moreover to be held in office
at the head of government, to rule
and do according to their wills,
that they might get gain and glory
of the ‘world, and, moreover, that
they might the more easily commit
adultery, and steal, and kill, and
do according to their own wills—

6 Now this great iniquity had come
upon the Nephites, in the space of
“not many years; and when Nephi
