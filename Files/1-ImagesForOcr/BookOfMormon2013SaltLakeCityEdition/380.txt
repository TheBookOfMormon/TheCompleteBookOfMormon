33 And it came to pass that Moroni-
hah took possession of the city of
Zarahemla again, and caused that
the Lamanites who had been taken
prisoners should depart out of the
land in “peace.

34 And thus ended the forty and
first year of the reign of the judges.

CHAPTER 2

Helaman, the son of Helaman, becomes
chief judge—Gadianton leads the band
of Kishkumen—Helaman’s servant
slays Kishkumen, and the Gadianton
band flees into the wilderness. About
50-49 B.c.

AND it came to pass in the forty
and second year of the reign of
the judges, after Moronihah had
established again peace between
the Nephites and the Lamanites,
behold there was no one to fill the
judgment-seat; therefore there be-
gan to be a contention again among
the people concerning who should
fill the judgment-seat.

2 And it came to pass that “Hela-
man, who was the son of Helaman,
was appointed to fill the judgment-
seat, by the *voice of the people.

3 But behold, “Kishkumen, who
had murdered Pahoran, did lay
wait to destroy Helaman also; and
he was upheld by his band, who
had entered into a covenant that no
one should know his wickedness.

4 For there was one “Gadianton,
who was exceedingly expert in many
words, and also in his craft, to carry
on the secret work of murder and
of robbery; therefore he became the
leader of the band of Kishkumen.

5 Therefore he did “flatter them,
and also Kishkumen, that if they
would place him in the judgment-
seat he would grant unto those
who belonged to his band that they
should be placed in power and au-
thority among the people; there-

 

fore Kishkumen sought to destroy
Helaman.

6 And it came to pass as he went
forth towards the judgment-seat
to destroy Helaman, behold one of
the servants of Helaman, having
been out by night, and having ob-
tained, through disguise, a knowl-
edge of those plans which had
been laid by this band to destroy
Helaman—

7 And it came to pass that he met
Kishkumen, and he gave unto him
a sign; therefore Kishkumen made
known unto him the object of his
desire, desiring that he would con-
duct him to the judgment-seat that
he might murder Helaman.

8 And when the servant of He-
laman had known all the heart of
Kishkumen, and how that it was his
“object to murder, and also that it
was the object of all those who be-
longed to his band to murder, and
to rob, and to gain power, (and this
was their ’secret plan, and their
combination) the servant of Hela-
man said unto Kishkumen: Let us
go forth unto the judgment-seat.

9 Now this did please Kishkumen
exceedingly, for he did suppose that
he should accomplish his design;
but behold, the servant of Helaman,
as they were going forth unto the
judgment-seat, did stab Kishkumen.
even to the heart, that he fell dead
without a groan. And he ran and
told Helaman all the things which
he had seen, and heard, and done.

10 And it came to pass that He-
laman did send forth to take this
band of robbers and “secret mur-
derers, that they might be executed
according to the law.

11 But behold, when Gadianton
had found that Kishkumen did not
return he feared lest that he should
be destroyed; therefore he caused
that his band should follow him.
And they took their flight out of
