the Lord, are considered as ‘dead,
both as to things temporal and to
things spiritual.

17 But behold, the resurrection of
Christ ¢redeemeth mankind, yea,
even all mankind, and bringeth
them back into the presence of the
Lord.

18 Yea, and it bringeth to pass
the condition of repentance, that
whosoever repenteth the same is
not “hewn down and cast into the
fire; but whosoever repenteth not is
hewn down and cast into the fire;
and there cometh upon them again
a ’spiritual death, yea, a second
death, for they are cut off again as to
things pertaining to righteousness.

19 Therefore repent ye, repent ye,
lest by knowing these things and
not doing them ye shall suffer your-
selves to come under condemnation,
and ye are brought down unto this
second death.

20 But behold, as I said unto you
concerning another 4sign, a sign of
his death, behold, in that day that
he shall suffer death the sun shall
be darkened and refuse to give his
light unto you; and also the moon
and the stars; and there shall be no
light upon the face of this land, even
from the time that he shall suffer
death, for the space of ‘three days,
to the time that he shall rise again
from the dead.

21 Yea, at the time that he shall
yield up the “ghost there shall be
*thunderings and lightnings for the
space of many hours, and the earth
shall shake and tremble; and the
‘rocks which are upon the face of
this earth, which are both above the
earth and beneath, which ye know
at this time are solid, or the more

 

part of it is one solid mass, shall be
“broken up;

22 Yea, they shall be rent in twain,
and shall ever after be “found in
seams and in cracks, and in bro-
ken fragments upon the face of the
whole earth, yea, both above the
earth and beneath.

23 And behold, there shall be
great “tempests, and there shall be
many mountains laid low, like unto
a valley, and there shall be many
places which are now called *val-
leys which shall become mountains,
whose height is great.

24 And “many highways shall be
broken up, and many cities shall
become desolate.

25 And many “graves shall be
opened, and shall yield up many of
their dead; and many saints shall
appear unto many.

26 And behold, thus hath the ¢an-
gel spoken unto me; for he said unto
me that there should be thunder-
ings and lightnings for the space
of many hours.

27 And he said unto me that while
the thunder and the lightning
lasted, and the tempest, that these
things should be, and that ¢<darkness
should cover the face of the whole
earth for the space of three days.

28 And the angel said unto me
that many shall see greater things
than these, to the intent that they
might believe that these signs and
these wonders should come to pass
upon all the face of this land, to
the intent that there should be no
cause for unbelief among the chil-
dren of men—

29 And this to the intent that who-
soever will believe might be saved,
and that whosoever will not believe,
