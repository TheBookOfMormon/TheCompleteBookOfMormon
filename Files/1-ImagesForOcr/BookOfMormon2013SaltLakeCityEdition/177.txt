and a fifth part of their °ziff, and
of their copper, and of their brass
and their iron; and a fifth part of
their fatlings; and also a fifth part
of all their grain.

4 And all this did he take to “sup-
port himself, and his wives and his
’concubines; and also his priests,
and their wives and their concu-
bines; thus he had changed the af-
fairs of the kingdom.

5 For he put down all the priests
that had been consecrated by his
father, and consecrated new “ones
in their stead, such as were lifted
up in the pride of their hearts.

6 Yea, and thus they were sup-
ported in their laziness, and in their
idolatry, and in their whoredoms,
by the taxes which king Noah had
put upon his people; thus did the
people labor exceedingly to sup-
port iniquity.

7 Yea, and they also became idola-
trous, because they were deceived
by the vain and flattering words of
the king and priests; for they did
speak flattering things unto them.

8 And it came to pass that king
Noah built many elegant and spa-
cious buildings; and he ornamented
them with fine work of wood, and
of all manner of “precious things, of
gold, and of silver, and of iron, and
of brass, and of ziff, and of copper;

9 And he also built hima spacious
palace, and a throne in the midst
thereof, all of which was of fine wood
and was ornamented with gold and
silver and with precious things.

10 And he also caused that his
workmen should work all manner
of fine work within the walls of
the ‘temple, of fine wood, and of
copper, and of brass.

11 And the seats which were set

 

apart for the “high priests, which
were above all the other seats, he
did ornament with pure gold; and
he caused a breastwork to be built
before them, that they might rest
their bodies and their arms upon
while they should speak lying and
vain words to his people.

12 And it came to pass that he
built a “tower near the temple; yea,
avery high tower, even so high that
he could stand upon the top thereof
and overlook the land of ’Shilom,
and also the land of ‘Shemlon, which
was possessed by the Lamanites;
and he could even look over all the
land round about.

13 And it came to pass that he
caused many buildings to be built
in the land Shilom; and he caused a
great tower to be built on the “hill
north of the land Shilom, which
had been a resort for the children
of Nephi at the time they fled out
of the land; and thus he did do with
the riches which he obtained by the
taxation of his people.

14 And it came to pass that he
placed his heart upon his riches,
and he spent his time in “riotous
living with his wives and his con-
cubines; and so did also his priests
spend their time with harlots.

15 And it came to pass that he
planted vineyards round about in
the land; and he built wine-presses,
and made “wine in abundance; and
therefore he became a wine-bibber,
and also his people.

16 And it came to pass that the La-
manites began to come in upon his
people, upon small numbers, and to
slay them in their fields, and while
they were tending their flocks.

17 And king Noah sent guards
round about the land to keep them
