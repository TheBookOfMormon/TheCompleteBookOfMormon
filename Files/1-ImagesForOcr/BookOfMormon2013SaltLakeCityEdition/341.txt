ditch which had been dug round
about, save it were by the entrance.

19 And thus were the Nephites pre-
pared to destroy all such as should
attempt to climb up to enter the fort
by any other way, by casting over
stones and arrows at them.

20 Thus they were prepared, yea,
a body of their strongest men, with
their swords and their slings, to
smite down all who should attempt
to come into their place of secu-
rity by the place of “entrance; and
thus were they prepared to defend
themselves against the Lamanites.

21 And it came to pass that the
captains of the Lamanites brought
up their armies before the place
of entrance, and began to contend
with the Nephites, to get into their
place of security; but behold, they
were driven back from time to time,
insomuch that they were slain with
an immense slaughter.

22 Now when they found that
they could not obtain power over
the Nephites by the pass, they be-
gan to dig down their banks of
earth that they might obtain a pass
to their armies, that they might
have an equal chance to fight; but
behold, in these attempts they were
swept off by the stones and arrows
which were thrown at them; and
instead of filling up their ditches
by pulling down the banks of earth,
they were filled up in a measure
with their dead and wounded
bodies.

23 Thus the Nephites had all power
over their enemies; and thus the La-
manites did attempt to destroy the
Nephites until their ¢chief captains
were all slain; yea, and more than
a thousand of the Lamanites were
slain; while, on the other hand,
there was not a single soul of the
Nephites which was slain.

24 There were about fifty who
were wounded, who had been ex-

 

posed to the arrows of the Lamanites
through the pass, but they were
shielded by their “shields, and their
breastplates, and their head-plates,
insomuch that their wounds were
upon their legs, many of which were
very severe.

25 And it came to pass, that when
the Lamanites saw that their chief
captains were all slain they fled
into the wilderness. And it came to
pass that they returned to the land
of Nephi, to inform their king,
Amalickiah, who was a 4Nephite by
birth, concerning their great ®loss.

26 And it came to pass that he was
exceedingly angry with his people,
because he had not obtained his
desire over the Nephites; he had
not subjected them to the yoke of
bondage.

27 Yea, he was exceedingly wroth,
and he did “curse God, and also Mo-
roni, swearing with an %oath that
he would drink his blood; and this
because Moroni had kept the com-
mandments of God in preparing
for the safety of his people.

28 And it came to pass, that on the
other hand, the people of Nephi did
«thank the Lord their God, because
of his matchless power in deliver-
ing them from the hands of their
enemies.

29 And thus ended the nineteenth
year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi.

30 Yea, and there was continual
peace among them, and exceedingly
great prosperity in the church be-
cause of their heed and diligence
which they gave unto the word of
God, which was declared unto them
by Helaman, and Shiblon, and Cori-
anton, and Ammon and his breth-
ren, yea, and by all those who had
been ordained by the “holy order
of God, being baptized unto re-
pentance, and sent forth to preach
among the people.
