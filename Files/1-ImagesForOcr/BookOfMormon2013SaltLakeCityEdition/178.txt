off; but he did not send a sufficient
number, and the Lamanites came
upon them and killed them, and
drove many of their flocks out of
the land; thus the Lamanites began
to destroy them, and to exercise
their hatred upon them.

18 And it came to pass that king
Noah sent his armies against them,
and they were driven back, or they
drove them back for a time; there-
fore, they returned rejoicing in
their spoil.

19 And now, because of this great
victory they were lifted up in the
pride of their hearts; they did “boast
in their own strength, saying that
their fifty could stand against thou-
sands of the Lamanites; and thus
they did boast, and did delight
in blood, and the shedding of the
blood of their brethren, and this
because of the wickedness of their
king and priests.

20 And it came to pass that there
was a man among them whose name
was “Abinadi; and he went forth
among them, and began to proph-
esy, saying: Behold, thus saith the
Lord, and thus hath he commanded
me, saying, Go forth, and say unto
this people, thus saith the Lord—
Wo be unto this people, for I have
seen their abominations, and their
wickedness, and their whoredoms;
and except they repent I will *visit
them in mine anger.

21 And except they repent and
turn to the Lord their God, behold,
I will deliver them into the hands
of their enemies; yea, and they shall
be brought into “bondage; and they
shall be afflicted by the hand of
their enemies.

22 And it shall come to pass that

 

they shall ¢know that lam the Lord
their God, and am a *jealous God,
visiting the iniquities of my people.

23 And it shall come to pass that
except this people repent and turn
unto the Lord their God, they shall
be brought into bondage; and none
shall “deliver them, except it be the
Lord the Almighty God.

24 Yea, and it shall come to pass
that when they shall “cry unto me
I will be ’slow to hear their cries;
yea, and I will suffer them that they
be smitten by their enemies.

25 And except they repent in ¢sack-
cloth and ashes, and cry mightily to
the Lord their God, I will not "hear
their prayers, neither will I deliver
them out of their afflictions; and
thus saith the Lord, and thus hath
he commanded me.

26 Now it came to pass that when
Abinadi had spoken these words
unto them they were wroth with
him, and sought to take away his
life; but the Lord “delivered him
out of their hands.

27 Now when king Noah had heard
of the words which Abinadi had
spoken unto the people, he was also
wroth; and he said: ¢Who is Abin-
adi, that land my people should be
judged of him, or *who is the Lord,
that shall bring upon my people
such great affliction?

28 [command you to bring Abinadi
hither, that I may slay him, for he
has said these things that he might
“stir up my people to anger one
with another, and to raise conten-
tions among my people; therefore
I will slay him.

29 Now the eyes of the people were
“blinded; therefore they °hardened
their hearts against the words of
