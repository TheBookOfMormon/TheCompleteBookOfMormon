36 Verily I say unto you, there
are none of them that have seen so
great things as ye have seen; neither
have they heard so great things as
ye have heard.

CHAPTER 20

Jesus provides bread and wine miracu-
lously and again administers the sac-
trament unto the people—The remnant
of Jacob will come to the knowledge of
the Lord their God and will inherit the
Americas—Jesus is the prophet like unto
Moses, and the Nephites are children
of the prophets—Others of the Lord’s
people will be gathered to Jerusalem.

AND it came to pass that he com-
manded the multitude that they
should “cease to “pray, and also his
disciples. And he commanded them
that they should not cease to pray
in their hearts.

2 And he commanded them that
they should arise and stand up upon
their feet. And they arose up and
stood upon their feet.

3 And it came to pass that he
“brake “bread again and blessed
it, and gave to the disciples to eat.

4 And when they had eaten he com-
manded them that they should break
bread, and give unto the multitude.

5 And when they had given unto
the multitude he also gave them
wine to drink, and commanded
them that they should give unto
the multitude.

6 Now, there had been no “bread,
neither wine, brought by the dis-
ciples, neither by the multitude;

7 But he truly ¢gave unto them
bread to eat, and also wine to drink.

 

8 And he said unto them: He that
eateth this bread eateth of ‘my
body to his soul; and he that drink-
eth of this wine drinketh of my
blood to his soul; and his soul shall
never hunger nor thirst, but shall
be filled.

9 Now, when the multitude had all
eaten and drunk, behold, they were
filled with the Spirit; and they did
cry out with one voice, and gave
glory to Jesus, whom they both saw
and heard.

10 And it came to pass that when
they had all given glory unto Jesus,
he said unto them: Behold now I
finish the commandment which
the Father hath commanded me
concerning this people, who are a
remnant of the house of Israel.

11 Ye remember that I spake unto
you, and said that when the ‘words
of "Isaiah should be fulfilled—be-
hold they are written, ye have them
before you, therefore search them—

12 And verily, verily, | say unto
you, that when they shall be fulfilled
then is the fulfilling of the “cov-
enant which the Father hath made
unto his people, O house of Israel.

13 And then shall the ¢remnants,
which shall be *scattered abroad
upon the face of the earth, be ‘gath-
ered in from the east and from
the west, and from the south and
from the north; and they shall be
brought to the ‘knowledge of the
Lord their God, who hath redeemed
them.

14 And the Father hath “‘com-
manded me that I should give unto
you this "land, for your inheritance.

15 And I say unto you, that if
the Gentiles do not “repent after
