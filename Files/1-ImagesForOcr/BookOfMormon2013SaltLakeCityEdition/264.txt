these words, he marveled again,
for he beheld that Ammon could
#discern his thoughts; but notwith-
standing this, king Lamoni did open
his mouth, and said unto him: Who
art thou? Art thou that Great Spirit,
who °knows all things?

19 Ammon answered and said unto
him: I am not.

20 And the king said: How know-
est thou the thoughts of my heart?
Thou mayest speak boldly, and tell
me concerning these things; and also
tell me by what power ye slew and
smote off the arms of my brethren
that scattered my flocks—

21 And now, ‘if thou wilt tell me
concerning these things, whatso-
ever thou desirest I will give unto
thee; and if it were needed, I would
guard thee with my armies; but I
know that thou art more powerful
than all they; nevertheless, what-
soever thou desirest of me I will
grant it unto thee.

22 Now Ammon being ¢wise, yet
harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt
thou hearken unto my words, if L
tell thee by what power I do these
things? And this is the thing that I
desire of thee.

23 And the king answered him,
and said: Yea, I “will believe all
thy words. And thus he was caught
with ’guile.

24 And Ammon began to speak
unto him with “boldness, and
said unto him: Believest thou that
there is a God?

25 And he answered, and said
unto him: I do not know what that
meaneth.

26 And then Ammon said: Believest
thou that there is a “Great Spirit?

27 And he said, Yea.

28 And Ammon said: This is God.

 

And Ammon said unto him again:
Believest thou that this Great Spirit,
who is God, created all things which
are in heaven and in the earth?

29 And he said: Yea, I believe that
he created all things which are in
the earth; but I do not know the
heavens.

30 And Ammon said unto him:
The heavens is a place where God
dwells and all his holy angels.

31 And king Lamoni said: Is it
above the earth?

32 And Ammon said: Yea, and he
looketh down upon all the chil-
dren of men; and he “knows all the
thoughts and “intents of the heart;
for by his hand were they all cre-
ated from the beginning.

33 And king Lamoni said: I believe
all these things which thou hast
spoken. Art thou “sent from God?

34 Ammon said unto him: I ama
4¢man; and man in the beginning was
created after the image of God, and 1
am called by his *Holy Spirit to teach
these things unto this people, that
they may be brought to a knowledge
of that which is just and true;

35 And a portion of that “Spirit
dwelleth in me, which giveth me
’knowledge, and also power accord-
ing to my faith and desires which
are in God.

36 Now when Ammon had said
these words, he began at the cre-
ation of the world, and also the
creation of Adam, and told him all
the things concerning the fall of
man, and “rehearsed and laid be-
fore him the *records and the holy
scriptures of the people, which had
been spoken by the ‘prophets, even
down to the time that their father,
Lehi, left Jerusalem.

37 And he also rehearsed unto
