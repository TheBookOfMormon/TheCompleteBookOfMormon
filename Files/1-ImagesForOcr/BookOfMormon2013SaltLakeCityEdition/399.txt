insomuch that we fell to the earth;
and when we were recovered from
our astonishment, behold they cast
us into “prison.

15 Now, as for the murder of this
man, we know not who has done
it; and only this much we know,
we ran and came “according as ye
desired, and behold he was dead,
according to the words of Nephi.

16 And now it came to pass that
the judges did expound the matter
unto the people, and did cry out
against Nephi, saying: Behold, we
know that this Nephi must have
agreed with some one to slay the
judge, and then he might declare
it unto us, that he might convert us
unto his faith, that he might raise
himself to be a great man, chosen
of God, and a prophet.

17 And now behold, we will detect
this man, and he shall confess his
fault and make known unto us the
true murderer of this judge.

18 And it came to pass that the
five were liberated on the day of
the burial. Nevertheless, they did
rebuke the judges in the words
which they had spoken against
Nephi, and did contend with them
one by one, insomuch that they did
confound them.

19 Nevertheless, they caused that
Nephi should be taken and bound
and brought before the multitude,
and they began to question him in
divers ways that they might cross
him, that they might accuse him
to death—

20 Saying unto him: Thou art con-
federate; who is this man that hath
done this murder? Now tell us, and
acknowledge thy fault; saying, Be-
hold here is “money; and also we
will grant unto thee thy life if thou
wilt tell us, and acknowledge the
agreement which thou hast made
with him.

21 But Nephi said unto them: O ye

 

“fools, ye uncircumcised of heart, ye
blind, and ye *stiffnecked people,
do ye know how long the Lord your
God will suffer you that ye shall go
on in this your way of sin?

22 O ye ought to begin to howl
and “mourn, because of the great
destruction which at this time doth
await you, except ye shall repent.

23 Behold ye say that I have agreed
with a man that he should murder
Seezoram, our chief judge. But be-
hold, I say unto you, that this is
because I have testified unto you
that ye might know concerning this
thing; yea, even for a witness unto
you, that I did know of the wicked-
ness and abominations which are
among you.

24 And because I have done this,
ye say that I have agreed with a
man that he should do this thing;
yea, because I showed unto you this
sign ye are angry with me, and seek
to destroy my life.

25 And now behold, I will show
unto you another sign, and see if
ye will in this thing seek to de-
stroy me.

26 Behold I say unto you: Go to
the house of Seantum, who is the
“brother of Seezoram, and say unto
him—

27 Has Nephi, the pretended
prophet, who doth prophesy so much
evil concerning this people, agreed
with thee, in the which ye have
murdered Seezoram, who is your
brother?

28 And behold, he shall say unto
you, Nay.

29 And ye shall say unto him: Have
ye murdered your brother?

30 And he shall stand with fear,
and wist not what to say. And be-
hold, he shall deny unto you; and
he shall make as if he were aston-
ished; nevertheless, he shall declare
unto you that he is innocent.

31 But behold, ye shall examine
