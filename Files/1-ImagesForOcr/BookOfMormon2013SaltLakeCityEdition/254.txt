unto himself, in “glory; and he doth
suffer that they may do this thing,
or that the people may do this thing
unto them, according to the hard-
ness of their hearts, that the °judg-
ments which he shall exercise upon
them in his wrath may be just; and
the ‘blood of the ‘innocent shall
stand as a witness against them,
yea, and cry mightily against them
at the last day.

12 Now Amulek said unto Alma:
Behold, perhaps they will burn us
also.

13 And Alma said: Be it according
to the will of the Lord. But, behold,
our work is not finished; therefore
they burn us not.

14 Now it came to pass that when
the bodies of those who had been
cast into the fire were consumed,
and also the records which were cast
in with them, the chief judge of the
land came and stood before Alma
and Amulek, as they were bound;
and he smote them with his hand
upon their “cheeks, and said unto
them: After what ye have seen, will
ye preach again unto this people,
that they shall be cast into a °lake
of fire and brimstone?

15 Behold, ye see that ye had not
power to save those who had been
cast into the fire; neither has God
saved them because they were of.
thy faith. And the judge smote them
again upon their cheeks, and asked:
What say ye for yourselves?

16 Now this judge was after the
order and faith of “Nehor, who slew
Gideon.

17 And it came to pass that Alma
and Amulek answered him ¢noth-

delivered them to the officers to be
’cast into prison.

18 And when they had been cast

 

into prison three days, there came
many “lawyers, and judges, and
priests, and teachers, who were of
the profession of Nehor; and they
came in unto the prison to see them,
and they questioned them about
many words; but they answered

19 And it came to pass that the
judge stood before them, and said:
Why do ye not answer the words
of this people? Know ye not that I
have “power to deliver you up unto
the flames? And he *commanded
them to speak; but they answered
nothing.

20 And it came to pass that they
departed and went their ways, but
came again on the morrow; and
the judge also smote them again
on their cheeks. And many came
forth also, and smote them, saying:
Will ye stand again and judge this
people, and condemn our law? If
ye have such great power why do
ye not ¢deliver yourselves?

21 And many such things did they
say unto them, gnashing their teeth
upon them, and spitting upon them,
and saying: How shall we look when
we are damned?

22 And many such things, yea, all
manner of such things did they say
unto them; and thus they did ¢mock
them for many days. And they
did withhold food from them that
they might hunger, and water
that they might thirst; and they also
did take from them their clothes
that they were naked; and thus they
were *bound with strong cords, and
confined in ‘prison.

23 And it came to pass after they
had thus suffered for many days,
(and it was on the twelfth day, in
