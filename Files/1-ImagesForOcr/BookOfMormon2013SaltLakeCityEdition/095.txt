sea; and if they look unto the land,
behold, darkness and sorrow, and
the light is darkened in the heav-
ens thereof.

CHAPTER 16

Isaiah sees the Lord—Isaiah’s sins are
forgiven—He is called to prophesy—
He prophesies of the rejection by the
Jews of Christ’s teachings—A remnant
will return—Compare Isaiah 6. About
559-545 B.C.

4IN the *year that king Uzziah died,
I ‘saw also the Lord sitting upon a
throne, high and lifted up, and his
train filled the temple.

2 Above it stood the “seraphim; each
one had six wings; with twain he
covered his face, and with twain
he covered his feet, and with twain he
did fly.

3 And one cried unto another, and
said: Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord
of Hosts; the whole earth is full of
his glory.

4 And the posts of the door moved
at the voice of him that cried, and
the house was filled with smoke.

5 Then said I: Wo is unto me! for
Iam undone; because I am a man
of unclean lips; and I dwell in the
midst of a people of unclean lips;
for mine eyes have “seen the King,
the Lord of Hosts.

6 Then flew one of the seraphim
unto me, having a live coal in his
hand, which he had taken with the
tongs from off the altar;

7 And he laid it upon my mouth,
and said: Lo, this has touched thy
lips; and thine ‘iniquity is taken
away, and thy sin purged.

8 Also I heard the voice of the
Lord, saying: “Whom shall I send,
and who will go for us? Then I said:
Here am I; send me.

 

9 And he said: Go and tell this
people—Hear ye indeed, but they
understood not; and see ye indeed,
but they perceived not.

10 Make the heart of this people
fat, and make their ears heavy,
and shut their eyes—lest they see
with their eyes, and “hear with
their ears, and understand with their
*heart, and be converted and be
healed.

11 Then said I: Lord, how long?
And he said: Until the cities be
wasted without inhabitant, and the
houses without man, and the land
be utterly desolate;

12 And the Lord have “removed
men far away, for there shall be
a great forsaking in the midst of
the land.

13 But yet there shall be a tenth,
and they shall return, and shall be
eaten, as a teil tree, and as an oak
whose substance is in them when
they cast their leaves; so the holy
seed shall be the substance thereof.

CHAPTER 17

Ephraim and Syria wage war against
Judah—Christ will be born of a virgin—
Compare Isaiah 7. About 559-545 B.C.

“AND it came to pass in the days of
’Ahaz the son of ‘Jotham, the son of
Uzziah, king of Judah, that ‘Rezin,
king of Syria, and *Pekah the son of
Remaliah, king of Israel, went up
toward Jerusalem to war against
it, but could not prevail against it.

2 And it was told the house of
David, saying: Syria is confederate
with Ephraim. And his heart was
moved, and the heart of his people,
as the trees of the wood are moved
with the wind.

3 Then said the Lord unto Isaiah:
Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou
