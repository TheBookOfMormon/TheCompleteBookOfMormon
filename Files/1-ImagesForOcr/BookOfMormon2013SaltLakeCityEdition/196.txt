CHAPTER 21

Limhi’s people are smitten and defeated
by the Lamanites—Limhi’s people meet
Ammon and are converted—They tell
Ammon of the twenty-four Jaredite
plates. About 122-121 B.c.

AND it came to pass that Limhi and
his people returned to the city of
Nephi, and began to dwell in the
land again in peace.

2 And it came to pass that after
many days the Lamanites began
again to be stirred up in anger
against the Nephites, and they be-
gan to come into the borders of the
land round about.

3 Now they durst not slay them,
because of the ‘oath which their
king had made unto Limhi; but they
would smite them on their ’cheeks,
and exercise authority over them;
and began to put heavy ‘burdens
upon their backs, and drive them
as they would a dumb ass—

4 Yea, all this was done that the
*word of the Lord might be ful-
filled.

5 And now the afflictions of the
Nephites were great, and there was
no way that they could deliver them-
selves out of their hands, for the
Lamanites had “surrounded them
on every side.

6 And it came to pass that the
people began to murmur with the
king because of their afflictions;
and they began to be desirous to
go against them to battle. And they
did afflict the king sorely with their
complaints; therefore he granted
unto them that they should do ac-
cording to their desires.

7 And they gathered themselves
together again, and put on their
armor, and went forth against the

 

Lamanites to drive them out of their
land.

8 And it came to pass that the La-
manites did beat them, and drove
them back, and ‘slew many of them.

9 And now there was a great
«mourning and lamentation among
the people of Limhi, the widow
mourning for her husband, the
son and the daughter mourning
for their father, and the brothers
for their brethren.

10 Now there were a great many
«widows in the land, and they did
cry mightily from day to day, for
a great fear of the Lamanites had
come upon them.

11 And it came to pass that their
continual cries did stir up the re-
mainder of the people of Limhi to
anger against the Lamanites; and
they went again to battle, but they
were driven back again, suffering
much loss.

12 Yea, they went again even the
third time, and suffered in the like
manner; and those that were not
slain returned again to the city of
Nephi.

13 And they did humble them-
selves even to the dust, subjecting
themselves to the “yoke of bondage,
’submitting themselves to be smit-
ten, and to be driven to and fro, and
burdened, according to the desires
of their enemies.

14 And they did “humble them-
selves even in the depths of hu-
mility; and they did cry mightily
to God; yea, even all the day long
did they cry unto their God that
he would ‘deliver them out of their
afflictions.

15 And now the Lord was ‘slow
