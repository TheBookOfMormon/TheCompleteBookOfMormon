many of their brethren had been
“slain;

30 And also that king Noah and
his priests had caused the people
to commit so many sins and iniqui-
ties against God; and they also did
mourn for the “death of Abinadi;
and also for the *departure of Alma
and the people that went with him,
who had formed a church of God
through the strength and power of
God, and faith on the words which
had been spoken by Abinadi.

31 Yea, they did mourn for their de-
parture, for they knew not whither
they had fled. Now they would have
gladly joined with them, for they
themselves had entered into a “cov-
enant with God to serve him and
keep his commandments.

32 And now since the coming of
Ammon, king Limhi had also en-
tered into a covenant with God, and
also many of his people, to serve
him and keep his commandments.

33 And it came to pass that king
Limhi and many of his people were
desirous to be baptized; but there
was none in the land that had “au-
thority from God. And Ammon de-
clined doing this thing, considering
himself an unworthy servant.

34 Therefore they did not at that
time form themselves into a “church,
waiting upon the Spirit of the Lord.
Now they were desirous to become
even as Alma and his brethren, who
had fled into the wilderness.

35 They were desirous to be bap-
tized as a witness and a testimony
that they were willing to serve God
with all their hearts; nevertheless
they did prolong the time; and an
account of their baptism shall be
“given hereafter.

36 And now all the study of Am-
mon and “his people, and king
Limhi and his people, was to de-
liver themselves out of the hands of
the Lamanites and from *bondage.

 

CHAPTER 22

Plans are made for the people to es-
cape from Lamanite bondage—The
Lamanites are made drunk—The peo-
ple escape, return to Zarahemla, and
become subject to King Mosiah. About
121-120 B.c.

AND now it came to pass that Am-
mon and king Limhi began to
consult with the people how they
should “deliver themselves out of
bondage; and even they did cause
that all the people should gather
themselves together; and this they
did that they might have the voice
of the people concerning the matter.

2 And it came to pass that they
could find no way to deliver them-
selves out of bondage, except it were
to take their women and children,
and their flocks, and their herds,
and their tents, and depart into the
wilderness; for the Lamanites being
so numerous, it was impossible for
the people of Limhi to contend with
them, thinking to deliver themselves
out of bondage by the sword.

3 Now it came to pass that “Gideon
went forth and stood before the
king, and said unto him: Now O
king, thou hast hitherto hearkened
unto my words many times when
we have been contending with our
brethren, the Lamanites.

4 And now O king, if thou hast
not found me to be an unprofitable
servant, or if thou hast hitherto lis-
tened to my words in any degree,
and they have been of service to
thee, even so I desire that thou
wouldst listen to my words at this
time, and I will be thy servant and
deliver this people out of bondage.

5 And the king granted unto him
that he might speak. And Gideon
said unto him:

6 Behold the back pass, through
the back wall, on the back side
of the city. The Lamanites, or the
