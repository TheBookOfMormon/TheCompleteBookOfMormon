when the sign was given, or from
the coming of Christ; therefore, nine
years had passed away.

9 And Nephi, who was the father
of Nephi, who had the charge of the
records, “did not return to the land
of Zarahemla, and could nowhere
be found in all the land.

10 And it came to pass that the peo-
ple did still “remain in wickedness,
notwithstanding the much preach-
ing and prophesying which was
sent among them; and thus passed
away the tenth year also; and the
eleventh year also passed away in
iniquity.

11 And it came to pass in the
thirteenth year there began to be
wars and contentions throughout
all the land; for the <Gadianton rob-
bers had become so numerous, and
did slay so many of the people,
and did lay waste so many cities, and
did spread so much death and
carnage throughout the land, that
it became expedient that all the
people, both the Nephites and the
Lamanites, should take up arms
against them.

12 Therefore, all the Lamanites
who had become converted unto the
Lord did unite with their brethren,
the Nephites, and were compelled,
for the “safety of their lives and their
women and their children, to take
up arms against those Gadianton
robbers, yea, and also to maintain
their rights, and the privileges of
their church and of their worship,
and their freedom and their “liberty.

13 And it came to pass that before
this thirteenth year had passed away
the Nephites were threatened with
utter destruction because of this
war, which had become exceedingly
sore.

14 And it came to pass that those
Lamanites who had united with the
Nephites were numbered among
the Nephites;

 

15 And their “curse was taken from
them, and their skin became *white
like unto the Nephites;

16 And their young men and their
daughters became exceedingly fair,
and they were numbered among
the Nephites, and were called Neph-
ites. And thus ended the thirteenth
year.

17 And it came to pass in the com-
mencement of the fourteenth year,
the war between the robbers and
the people of Nephi did continue
and did become exceedingly sore;
nevertheless, the people of Nephi
did gain some advantage of the
robbers, insomuch that they did
drive them back out of their lands
into the mountains and into their
secret places.

18 And thus ended the fourteenth
year. And in the fifteenth year they
did come forth against the people
of Nephi; and because of the wick-
edness of the people of Nephi, and
their many contentions and dissen-
sions, the Gadianton robbers did
gain many advantages over them.

19 And thus ended the fifteenth
year, and thus were the people in
a state of many afflictions; and the
“sword of destruction did hang over
them, insomuch that they were
about to be smitten down by it,
and this because of their iniquity.

CHAPTER 3

Giddianhi, the Gadianton leader, de-
mands that Lachoneus and the Neph-
ites surrender themselves and their
lands—Lachoneus appoints Gidgid-
doni as chief captain of the armies—
The Nephites assemble in Zarahemla
and Bountiful to defend themselves.

AND now it came to pass that in the
sixteenth year from the coming of
Christ, “Lachoneus, the governor of
the land, received an epistle from
