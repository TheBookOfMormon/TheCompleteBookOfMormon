then is a time that whosoever dieth
in his sins, as to a temporal *death,
shall also ‘die a spiritual death; yea,
he shall die as to things pertaining
unto righteousness.

17 Then is the time when their
torments shall be as a “lake of fire
and brimstone, whose flame as-
cendeth up forever and ever; and
then is the time that they shall be
chained down to an everlasting de-
struction, according to the power
and captivity of Satan, he having
subjected them according to his will.

18 Then, I say unto you, they shall
be as though there had been “no re-
demption made; for they cannot be
redeemed according to God’s justice;
and they cannot *die, seeing there
is no more corruption.

19 Now it came to pass that when
Alma had made an end of speaking
these words, the people began to be
more astonished;

20 But there was one Antionah,
who was a chief ruler among them,
came forth and said unto him: What
is this that thou hast said, that man
should rise from the dead and be
changed from this mortal to an
“immortal state, that the soul can
never die?

21 What does the scripture mean,
which saith that God placed “cheru-
bim and a flaming sword on the
east of the garden of ’Eden, lest our
first parents should enter and par-
take of the fruit of the tree of life,
and live forever? And thus we see
that there was no possible chance
that they should live forever.

22 Now Alma said unto him: This

 

is the thing which I was about to
explain. Now we see that Adam
did “fall by the partaking of the
forbidden *fruit, according to the
word of God; and thus we see, that
by his fall, all mankind became a
‘lost and fallen people.

23 And now behold, I say unto
you that if it had been possible for
Adam to have “partaken of the fruit
of the tree of life at that time, there
would have been no death, and the
word would have been void, mak-
ing God a liar, for he said: *If thou
eat thou shalt surely die.

24 And we see that “death comes
upon mankind, yea, the death which
has been spoken of by Amulek,
which is the temporal death; nev-
ertheless there was a space granted
unto ’man in which he might repent;
therefore this life became a ‘pro-
bationary state; a time to ‘prepare
to meet God; a time to prepare for
that endless state which has been
spoken of by us, which is after the
resurrection of the dead.

25 Now, if it had not been for the
plan of redemption, which was laid
from the foundation of the world,
there could have been no ¢resur-
rection of the dead; but there was
a plan of *’redemption laid, which
shall bring to pass the resurrec-
tion of the dead, of which has been
spoken.

26 And now behold, if it were pos-
sible that our first parents could
have gone forth and partaken of the
“tree of life they would have been
forever miserable, having no pre-
paratory state; and thus the "plan
